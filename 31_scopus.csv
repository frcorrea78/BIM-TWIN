However, considered in isolation, the raw data are of little use and value. They must be processed and put into a geometric context within the infrastructure asset, which facilitates the interpretation and analysis of the data. This supports informed decision making, which in turn leads to effective actions. This study outlines a new approach that enables the modelling of structural performance monitoring systems in a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and hence permits sensor data to be visualised directly on BIM models. The paper addresses aspects related to: (a) interoperability and standard data models; (b) management and visualisation of monitoring data; and (c) data interpretation and analysis. A prestressed concrete bridge, with a comprehensive built-in structural performance monitoring system, has been used as a case study. The case study demonstrates that by including and visualising monitoring data directly on BIM models the acquired data gain geometrical context within the built asset, which facilitates better interpretation, analysis and all the data-sharing benefits associated with the BIM approach. © 2016 Published with permission by the ICE under the CC-BY licence.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026799873

However, few studies have investigated their real in-service behavior. Concurrently, the use of advanced sensor systems, such as those utilizing fiber-optic sensors, have begun to find widespread use in structural health monitoring due to their high accuracy and long-term stability and durability. In this paper, the real performance of a newly constructed skewed half-through plate girder railway bridge was assessed using an integrated fiber optic monitoring system installed during the bridge's construction. Monitoring data recorded during the passage of 12 separate trains consisted of strains measured along the length of the main steel plate girders and crossbeams. Based on available design and construction information, a three-dimensional finite-element model capable of simulating the railway bridge's response was constructed and used to investigate and provide comparisons with monitoring results of the performance of such bridges under passing trains. The influence of track cant on load distribution between the two main girders was discussed, and the live load utilization percentage of the main girders was estimated to be approximately 37% of its design capacity. In addition, the effect of different transverse crossbeam end-connection details (pinned or moment connected) and the influence of axle load distribution through track ballast on the overall response of the bridge structure were evaluated. The results obtained in this study have not only led to the establishment of a comprehensive performance baseline for the newly constructed bridge for long-term condition monitoring but may also be used for improving the design and in-service structural evaluation of such bridges. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056626655

Details of the installation of a large FOS network on a new steel-concrete composite railway bridge in the United Kingdom are presented. An overview of the FOS technology, installation techniques, and monitoring program is also presented, and the monitoring results from several construction stages are discussed. A finite-element (FE) model was developed and a phased analysis was carried out to simulate strain development in the bridge during consecutive construction stages. The response of the self-sensing bridge to the time-dependent properties of the concrete deck was evaluated by comparing FOS measurements to predicted results according to several model code formulations implemented in the FE model. The preservice strain distribution due to dead loading is typically assumed to act uniformly along the bridge length; however, the monitoring results revealed that the distribution was highly variable as a result of the complex interactions between gravity loading, bridge geometry, time-dependent concrete properties, and temperature effects. Moment utilization of the main girders and composite beams, during preservice conditions, was assessed and found to be between 19.3 and 24.9% of the respective design cross-section capacities. Quantifying preservice performance via integrated sensing also provided a critical baseline for the bridge, which enables future data-driven condition assessments. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051146118

These data can represent how the structure responds to various stimuli over time when in operation. Many models have been proposed in literature to represent such data, such as linear statistical models. Based upon these models, the health of the structure is reasoned about, e.g. through damage indices, changes in likelihood and statistical parameter estimates. On the other hand, physics-based models are typically used when designing structures to predict how the structure will respond to operational stimuli. These models represent how the structure responds to stimuli under idealised conditions. What remains unclear in the literature is how to combine the observed data with information from the idealised physics-based model into a model that describes the responses of the operational structure. This paper introduces a new approach which fuses together observed data from a physical structure during operation and information from a mathematical model. The observed data are combined with data simulated from the physics-based model using a multi-output Gaussian process formulation. The novelty of this method is how the information from observed data and the physics-based model is balanced to obtain a representative model of the structures response to stimuli. We present our method using data obtained from a fibre-optic sensor network installed on experimental railway sleepers. The curvature of the sleeper at sensor and also non-sensor locations is modelled, guided by the mathematical representation. We discuss how this approach can be used to reason about changes in the structures behaviour over time using simulations and experimental data. The results show that the methodology can accurately detect such changes. They also indicate that the methodology can infer information about changes in the parameters within the physics-based model, including those governing components of the structure not measured directly by sensors such as the ballast foundation. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065400940
