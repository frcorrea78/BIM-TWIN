Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy.

In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049913864

To precisely estimate the vertical and longitudinal displacements, we used the InSAR time-series technique with multi-track stacks of Sentinel-1 SAR dataset and a single-track stack of COSMO-SkyMed SAR data over two extradosed bridge cases; Kimdaejung and Muyoung bridges between 2013 and 2017. The vertical and longitudinal displacements are estimated using multi-track Sentinel-1 SAR data and orientation angle of bridges, and we converted the displacements into thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection. From COSMO-SkyMed data, we calculated the horizontal thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection assuming that they dominantly contribute to the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively. This assumption appeared reasonable based on the comparison with calculations from Sentinel-1 data. The deflection patterns exhibit downward movements at the mid-spans between towers.

The issue is exacerbated as it applies to many structures at the network level rather than to single structures or limited areas. To this effect, catalogues for assessment of decay conditions and identification of maintenance actions are crucial pieces of information for infrastructure management purposes. Within this context, innovative non-destructive methods, such as space-borne techniques, have been increasingly used for monitoring purposes in the past two decades. Among these, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery technique is gaining momentum nowadays. This method is used to monitor ground and infrastructure displacements at the large scale with a millimeter resolution. It can compare radar satellite images over time, and it is capable to measure variations accurately using interferometry. An advantage of using InSAR techniques is that these are not affected by cloudiness as well as lighting conditions, since data can be also collected at night time. On the contrary, InSAR is computational-demanding as it requires to filter out unnecessary information from the entire captured area to obtain data on the target domain. Most common applications include landslide assessment and monitoring of surface deformations following major seismic events. This paper reports a methodology for the assessment of surface deformations of viaducts by reducing drastically computational time. To this purpose, a multi-stage automatic bridge monitoring protocol is developed at the network level by integration of information into Geographic Information System (GIS) catalogues and use of the InSAR imagery technique. The first stage locates the viaducts in the area of interest by querying open data and inputting results into a GIS catalogue. On a second stage, an InSAR analysis of the identified bridges is performed. This approach allows an estimate of surface displacements as well as an identification of bridge areas affected by millimeter-scale settlements.

In order to overcome these limitations, this study proposes a structural safety diagnosis method using laser scanning and BIM. In spite of the various studies related to laser scanning and BIM, it is difficult to find a study that verifies the effect of shortening the service period and cost reduction in terms of project management. Therefore, in this study, case analysis of structural safety diagnosis of large-scale civil infrastructure was conducted. In the structural safety diagnosis, the laser scanning data and the BIM model were compared and analyzed to determine the degree of deformation of pipe rack (e.g., truss, column). Laser scanning data reflects the deformation state of large-scale civil infrastructure. On the other hand, the BIM model was constructed by reflecting the state before the transformation with reference to the laser scanning data. Finally, proposed method of structural safety diagnosis saved four months. In terms of manpower saving, 125 man-month was saved.

This research aims to demonstrate the viability of using medium-resolution Copernicus ESA Sentinel-1A (C-Band) SAR products and their contribution to improve current maintenance strategies in case of localised foundation settlements in airport runways. To this purpose, “Runway n.3” of the “Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport” in Fiumicino, Rome, Italy was investigated as an explanatory case study, in view of historical geotechnical settlements affecting the runway area. In this context, a geostatistical study is developed for the exploratory spatial data analysis and the interpolation of the Sentinel-1A SAR data. The geostatistical analysis provided ample information on the spatial continuity of the Sentinel 1 data in comparison with the high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed data and the ground-based topographic levelling data. Furthermore, a comparison between the PSI outcomes from the Sentinel-1A SAR data—interpolated through Ordinary Kriging—and the ground-truth topographic levelling data demonstrated the high accuracy of the Sentinel 1 data. This is proven by the high values of the correlation coefficient (r = 0.94), the multiple R-squared coefficient (R2 = 0.88) and the Slope value (0.96).

Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) measurements, geospatial analyses, and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) are employed for achieving the purpose. Two single learners, i.e., Regression Tree (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and two ensemble learners, i.e., Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Random Forest (RF) are utilized for estimating the surface motion ratio in terms of mm/year over the Province of Pistoia (Tuscany Region, central Italy, 964 km2), in which strong subsidence phenomena have occurred. The interferometric process of 210 Sentinel-1 images from 2014 to 2019 allows exploiting the average displacements of 52,257 Persistent Scatterers as output targets to predict. A set of 29 environmental-related factors are preprocessed by SAGA-GIS, version 2.3.2, and ESRI ArcGIS, version 10.5, and employed as input features. Once the dataset has been prepared, three wrapper feature selection approaches (backward, forward, and bi-directional) are used for recognizing the set of most relevant features to be used in the modeling. A random splitting of the dataset in 70% and 30% is implemented to identify the training and test set. Through a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) and a 10-Fold Cross-Validation (CV), the algorithms are trained and validated. Therefore, the Predictive Performance of MLAs is evaluated and compared by plotting the Taylor Diagram. Outcomes show that SVM and BRT are the most suitable algorithms; in the test phase, BRT has the highest Correlation Coefficient (0.96) and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (0.44 mm/year), while the SVM has the lowest difference between the standard deviation of its predictions (2.05 mm/year) and that of the reference samples (2.09 mm/year). Finally, algorithms are used for mapping surface motion over the study area. We propose three case studies on critical stretches of two-lane rural roads for evaluating the reliability of the procedure. Road authorities could consider the proposed methodology for their monitoring, management, and planning activities. © 2020 by the authors.

Satellite multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques enable measurement of building displacements over time with millimetre-scale accuracy. Compared to traditional ground-based monitoring, MT-InSAR can yield denser and cheaper building observations, representing a cost-effective monitoring tool. However, without integrating MT-InSAR techniques and structural assessment, the potential of InSAR monitoring cannot be fully exploited. This integration is particularly demanding for large construction projects, where big datasets need to be processed. In this paper, we present a new automated methodology that integrates MT-InSAR-based building deformations and damage assessment procedures to evaluate settlement-induced damage to buildings adjacent to tunnel excavations. The developed methodology was applied to the buildings along an 8-km segment of the Crossrail tunnel route in London, using COSMO-SkyMed MT-InSAR data from 2011 to 2015. The methodology enabled the identification of damage levels for 858 buildings along the Crossrail twin tunnels, providing an unprecedented number of high quality field observations for building response to settlements. The proposed methodology can be used to improve current damage assessment procedures, for the benefit of future underground excavation projects in urban areas. © 2021 The Authors.

Its ceaseless development and construction can be taken as a proof of its importance even despite the corresponding financial and time demands. The complexity and scale of the projects related to transportation infrastructure presents an ideal field for implementation of the BIM approaches. However, it is necessary to implement the BIM to the whole life cycle of the transport structure, especially not only to the pre-investment and investment phases but also to the operation and maintenance. For every road infrastructure, it is important to observe the performance of the road, behaviour of road users and evaluate the resulting safety risks, to be able to correspond with adequate and effective measures and to secure sufficient level of safety. The paper aims to present an implementation of the road safety aspects and statistics into the processes of BIM applications and strategies, which are prepared on the base of Government Resolution No 958, on the importance of the Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the Czech Republic.

On the other hand, the Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a Non-destructive technology widely applied to monitor the internal state of infrastructure asset by rapid electromagnetic inspections. This research aims to investigate the viability of a novel Non-Destructive Health-Monitoring Approach (ND-HMA) based on the synergistic use of satellite remote sensing and GPR techniques for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of damages induced by structural subsidence. The analyses were developed to identify and detect structural displacements of the Olivieri Bridge, located in Salerno, Italy. To this purpose, commercial VHR COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) products, provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), were acquired and processed by persistent scatterers (PS) InSAR technique. The historical time-series of deformations of the scatterers, found in correspondence of critical structural elements of the structure (i.e., bridge piers and arcs), were analyzed. Furthermore, in-situ GPR inspection analysis were carried out by using multi-frequency GPR systems equipped with both air-launched and ground-coupled antennas with central frequency ranging between 200 MHz and 1000 MHz. The implementation of the integrated approach provides a technologically enhanced and reliable mechanism for the provision of ""early warning""information to be more rapidly processed and conclusively actioned by asset owners and management agencies. In particular, a novel data interpretation approach is proposed based on the selection of several PS data-points with coherent deformation trends on the bridge and the analysis of GPR outputs. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that multi-Temporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be applied to complement non-destructive ground-based analyses (e.g., ground-penetrating radars), thereby paving the way for integrated approaches in the smart monitoring of infrastructure assets. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The need for fully integrated models has led to develop various tools to support the designers throughout the decision-making process of the entire life cycle of an infrastructure project. In particular, the design of transport infrastructures is a complex process that involves issues concerning all the different fields of civil engineering. In this framework, the BIM method can be efficiently applied to support the project of drainage systems capable of protecting railways and roadways from potential hydraulic risks. According to the above, this study presents an optimized BIM-based methodology for the integrated analysis of the flood risk and the design of the drainage system components. Specifically, the proposed method allows to implement hydraulics and hydrological numerical models as part of the different design phases. Such an approach holds two main advantages for the designer. On one hand, the computational modelling provides a decisive support in both defining water surface profiles over the designed area and identifying the spots exposed to major hydrological risks. On the other hand, the hydraulically guided modelling of each component of the drainage system allows for an increase of the overall productivity and efficiency of the project. A case study is presented to highlight the great potential of the proposed approach in ensuring both the integrity of datasets and the rapid clash detection of critical interferences between each system component. In conclusion, new perspectives about a fully integrated hydraulics analysis in the infrastructures design process are stressed out. © 2020 The Author(s).",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083429549
