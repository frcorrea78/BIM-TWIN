Cyclic inspections by hand according to DIN 1076 are the basis for planning maintenance and repair measures for our engineering structures. The calculation of condition ratings is performed based on detected deficiencies. The documentation of the inspection is done primarily within the program system SIB-BW. The system offers a comparably uniform rating standard and enables a limited retrospective and prospective view for maintenance planning. New developments like BIM or continuous, sensor-based monitoring, which is established in other branches, are not yet conceptually integrated. In light of the digital transformation the question arises how the well established manual and the digital assessment as well as BIM generated data can be unified within one continuous process chain and which benefits can by created by doing so. Therefore, the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) has initiated the “smartBridge Hamburg” project which prototypically tests the concept of the digital twin using the Koehlbrandbruecke in Hamburg. The digital twin is used to conceptually unify the BI-model as well as analogue and electronic assessment data and to provide aggregated data in a form that meets the needs of different user groups. This paper presents premises and basic considerations prior to project initiation. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086148171

Digitalization is one of the most important change processes in this century and affects all areas of our society. In the field of civil engineering, digitalization offers many potentials for all phases of the life cycle of structures, which can be expanded by making data available and defining new ways of working with them. Digital methods, in particular building information modeling (BIM) and structural health monitoring (SHM), offer excellent approaches to satisfy this idea, especially for infrastructure engineering structures and can contribute to make the structure operation more efficient. The process of inspection of infrastructure structures follows fixed deadlines. With the help of the presented concept a digitally supported maintenance of railway bridges shall be developed by the interlocking of BIM and SHM in order to enable a predictive maintenance management and thus to improve the reliability of engineering structures over the lifetime. Within the framework of concept development, the required methods and processes are defined, explained and harmonized. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn.

Digitization and the use of BIM technology are becoming increasingly important for the construction industry. The BIM method and the visual representation of the object in the physical and virtual models can be helpful tools not only for the design and construction of new buildings, but also for the implementation and operation of measurement facilities on existing buildings and engineering structures. Using the example of a project for data-based assessment of an existing bridge, we will show how BIM, 3-D printing, QR codes and mixed reality glasses support the design of measurement facilities. The incipient digital transformation in the construction industry and the growing need for data-based recalculation concepts for aging transport infrastructure opens up enormous potential for digitalization. Based on a planned measurement for the data-driven update of the static system using Bayeś Theorem, it is shown how this potential can be used to support the planning and execution of measurement projects on structures, thereby achieving an increase in quality and efficiency. By generating and visualizing three-dimensional models of structures and providing technical specifications of the measurement equipment through QR codes, both the installation process and the subsequent maintenance of the instrumentation can be supported. , Ernst und Sohn.

The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) is the answer to changing markets and increasing quality requirements. Customers demand individualized products and smaller lot sizes. This requires the end-to-end digitalization of manufacturing processes and raises the need for system architectures for next-generation automation systems. Within the context of the national reference project BaSys 4, we researched a service-based architecture for the automation domain and integrated it with ongoing standardization activities. Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) is a proven architecture pattern from the domain of IT systems. It propagates reusable services that are orchestrated to create scalable applications. Our SoA is based on the concept of asset administration shells that realize digital twins, which are digital representations of production assets with unified interfaces that enable access to asset services and data. We explain and discuss realization concepts for digital twins, and illustrate our experiences with the transfer of the service-based architecture principle to the automation industry within the context of selected Industrie 4.0 use cases. We highlight solution approaches for the efficient realization of lot size 1 production as well as for creating digital twins of production assets, and discuss levels of Industrie 4.0 maturity. © 2020 ITU.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099545037
