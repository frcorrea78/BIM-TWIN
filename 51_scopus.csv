Especially in dynamic environments, where the setting and occupancy keep changing, knowing occupancy information, including the number and identities of the occupants and where they are located, can be beneficial in energy management as well as other application areas including safety, security and emergency response. In particular, occupancy information has a direct impact on various aspects of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as heat loads, system running time, required heating, cooling and distribution of conditioned air, and preferred temperature set points. Energy-saving strategies can be carried out in response to real-time occupancy changes. In this paper, an RFID based occupancy detection system is proposed to support demand-driven HVAC operations by detecting and tracking multiple stationary and mobile occupants in multiple spaces simultaneously. The proposed system estimates the thermal zone where each occupant is located, and reports the number of occupants for each thermal zone in real time. The field tests yielded an average zone level detection accuracy of 88% for stationary occupants and 62% for mobile occupants. For scattering analysis, averages distances to corresponding centroids were 1.45 m and 3.24 m for stationary and mobile occupants, respectively. In order to explore the benefits of demand-driven HVAC operations, current HVAC work procedures are examined, major energy consumers in HVAC systems are identified and quantified, and energy-saving strategies are presented. This study aims to support reducing the consumption of the HVAC systems by integration of the occupancy detection system and the demand-driven HVAC operation strategies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860313651

Part of the difficulty arises from shortcomings in available sensor technology, but an even greater deficiency is the lack of analysis methods appropriate to the determination of occupancy. This paper describes a pilot study describing new sensing and data analysis techniques, applied to the determination of space occupancy. The central premise of the paper is that improved building operation with respect to energy management, security, and indoor environmental quality will be possible with better detection of building occupancy resolved in space and time. We developed and deployed a network of passive infrared occupancy sensors in two private offices, and applied analysis tools based on Bayesian probability theory to determine occupancy. Specifically, a class of graphical probability models, called belief networks, was applied to the occupancy data generated by the sensor network. The inference of primary importance is a probability distribution over the number of occupants and their locations in a building, given past and present sensor measurements. Inferences were computed for occupancy and its temporal persistence in individual offices as well as the persistence of sensor status. The raw sensor data were also used to calibrate the sensor belief network, including the occupancy transition matrix used in the Markov model, sensor sensitivity, and sensor failure models. This study shows that the belief network framework can be applied to the analysis of data streams from sensor networks, offering significant benefits to building operation compared to current practice. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The developed presence sensor is based on video analysis, using a static camera. Composed of three main steps, the first one consists in change detection using a background model updated at different levels to manage the most common variations of the environment. Second, a moving objects tracking, based on interest points, is performed. Third, in order to know the nature of the various objects that could be present in the scene, multiple cascades of boosted classifiers are used. The validation protocol, defined by the industrial partners involved in the CAPTHOM project focusing among other things on ""Energy Management in Building"", is then detailed. Three applications integrated into the CAPTHOM project illustrate how the developed system can help in collecting useful information for the building management system.

Our results show that state-of-the-art, schedule-based occupancy prediction algorithms achieve an overall prediction accuracy of over 80%. We also show that the performance of these algorithms is close to the theoretical upper bound expressed by the predictability of the input schedules. Building upon these results, we used ISO 13790-standard modelling techniques to analyse the energy savings that can be achieved by smart heating controllers that use occupancy predictors.

The objective of study is to perform complex analysis of the effect of domestic occupancy profiles on the energy performance of energy efficient house and assess applicability of default DesignBuilder occupancy profiles at local conditions. Results show that the influence of the profile with 4 occupants (OP2) on overall primary energy demand for different cases is never exceeding 5% compared to default DesignBuilder profiles. The influence of households with 2 occupants (OP3, OP4) on overall primary energy demand varies from 14% to 21% compared to default profiles. The simulation results revealed that the use of different occupancy profiles correlates with the total energy performance of the building.

We believe that energy can be saved with the notion of implicit occupancy sensing where existing IT infrastructure can be used to replace and/or supplement explicit dedicated sensors to determine building occupancy and drive building operation. Implicit sensing has the promise to be both lower in cost than explicit sensing based on PIR and ultrasound sensors and to offer additional useful data about the occupants of a building. Our implicit sensing methods are largely based on monitoring IP and MAC addresses in Wi-Fi access points and in routers, and then correlating these addresses to the occupancy of a floor, area, or room of a building. We experimentally evaluate the feasibility of this dual-use of IT infrastructure. We demonstrate an application of implicit sensing to sense the pending occupancy of a user workspace and automatically control the plugged-in devices in the workspace.

One possible explanation to the observed results is the presence of extreme energy users in the buildings who can have an important influence on their moderate peers and revoke the benefits of occupancy interventions. While this 'extremism' in human behavior phenomenon has been extensively studied in various social science fields, it has yet to be applied on the study of energy conservation from occupancy interventions in commercial buildings. Using agent-based modeling and data from actual commercial buildings, this paper evaluates the influence of extreme energy users (1) on their peers and on the energy performance of commercial buildings and (2) on the effectiveness of commonly implemented occupancy interventions. Parametric variations and statistical analyses indicate that extremism can highly affect the effectiveness of traditional occupancy interventions. In parallel, a combination of methods has shown to empower moderate energy users, helping diffuse and maintain energy conservation practices even in the presence of extreme energy users. The demonstrated capability to test and optimize occupancy interventions is expected to support and boost their adoption in large-scale energy conservation initiatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the authors proposed a novel occupancy detection approach through a coupled indoor positioning system. The system integrates conventional k-nearest neighbor positioning algorithm and stochastic random walk algorithm to collect high-resolution occupancy data through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. The proposed system is able to identify the meshed geospatial distribution of occupants, and to future track their movements in a network covered space. The detected occupancy meshes are suitable for direct implementation in building facility management since their operation is based on thermal zones rather than occupants' coordinates. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed system, the authors conducted a preliminary experiment in an institutional building.
