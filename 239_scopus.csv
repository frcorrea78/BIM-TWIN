One of the ways to solve this task of innovative development is modernization of architectural and building design, in particular implementation of BIM technology enabling making efficient decisions at all stages of building and structures life cycle – from investment concept till operation and even demolition. In relation to this the industry demands highly qualified workers and engineers (bachelor students) being able not only to get new knowledge but to use them for solving practical tasks of modern construction industry and market. The article present a concept of designing educational programme for training students with major 08.03.01 «Construction» (bachelor degree) focusing on systematized knowledge, skills and tools for training, in particular, through interconnection and continuity during course and diploma papers based on BIM technology. © 2017, Saint-Petersburg Mining University.
