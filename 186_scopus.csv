This paper presents an automated process that uses 2D floorplans and elevation drawings to generate semantically-rich BIMs with adequate geometry for energy simulation and integration of the significant diversity and volume of data necessary for day-to-day building operations and facility management. The proposed approach minimizes the resources necessary for both model creation and maintenance, limiting initial BIM creation to match the level of detail available on available building drawings, while providing the flexibility to incorporate complex geometry at a future date. Two case studies, a set of university campus buildings and a healthcare training facility, have been modelled using this approach and the resultant model generation speed, accuracy, and resultant quality are discussed, along with limitations and future process improvements. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066267182
