BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619234

The assumption is that there are both controllable factors (control variables) and uncontrollable/difficult to control factors (noise variables) that operate on the quality characteristic of a process. The goal of parameter design is to choose the levels of the control variables that optimize a defined quality characteristic while minimizing the variation imposed on the process via the noise variables. Parameter design was popularized in the mid 1980s by Japanese quality consultant Genichi Taguchi. A panel discussion edited by Nair summarized important responses to Taguchi's ideas and methodology. In the last decade, there have been many applications and new developments in this important area.

But there has not been a comparable progress in the development of tools intended to assist design to generate architectural forms in an easy and interactive way. Even worse, architects who use the powerful means provided by computers as a direct tool to create architectural forms are still an exception. Architecture continues to be produced by traditional means using the computer as little more than a drafting tool. The main reasons that may explain this situation can be identified rather easily, although there will be significant differences of opinion. In my opinion, it is a mistake trying to advance too rapidly and, for instance, proposing integrated design methods using expert systems and artificial intelligence while no adequate tools to generate and modify simple 3D-models are available. The modeling tools we have at the present moment are unsatisfactory. Their principal limitation is the lack of appropriate instruments to modify interactively the model once it has been created. This is a fundamental aspect in any design activity, where the designer is constantly going forward and backwards, re-elaborating once and again some particular aspect of the model, or its general layout, or even coming back to a previous solution that had been temporarily abandoned. This paper presents a general summary of the actual situation and recent developments that may be incorporated to architectural design tools in a near future, together with some critical remarks about their relevance to architecture. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034216595

Assuming an input of points that can be described by a single non-self-intersecting NURBS, this article presents a new method that leverages segmented point clouds and outputs NURBS surfaces. It starts by successively fitting uniform B-Spline curves in two-dimensional as planar cross-sectional cuts on each surface. An intermediate B-Spline surface is then computed by globally optimizing and lofting over the cross-sections. This surface is used to parameterize the points and perform final refinement to a NURBS. For cylindrical segments such as pipes, a new supervised method is also introduced to string the fitted segments, identify connection types, standardize the connections, and then refine them using NURBS optimization.

Our algorithm is special in the sense that it can be applied to objects with both an implicit and a parametric representation, such as superquadrics, supershapes, and Dupin cyclides. The input is a Constructive Solid Geometry tree (CSG tree) that contains the Boolean operations, the parameters of the primitives, and the global deformations. At each node of the CSG tree, the implicit formulations of the subtrees are used to quickly determine the parts to be transmitted to the parent node, while the primitives' parametric definition are used to refine an intermediary mesh around the intersection curves. The output is both an implicit equation and a mesh representing its solution. For the resulting object, an implicit equation with guaranteed differential properties is obtained by simple combinations of the primitives' implicit equations using R-functions. Depending on the chosen R-function, this equation is continuous and can be differentiable everywhere. The primitives' parametric representations are used to directly polygonize the resulting surface by generating vertices that belong exactly to the zero-set of the resulting implicit equation.

Despite complete interchangeability-based design, geometric variability resulting from production processes creates variances between the as-built states of identical components. This inevitable occurrence of discrepancies between design and fabrication creates challenges for component aggregation on site and causes rework during assembly and erection. This paper presents a framework for optimally planning the order and arrangement of components such that the impacts of geometric variability, and the rework it can cause are minimized. The proposed framework compares the critical interface points of components in order to optimize the assembly plan in two distinct approaches: (1) minimization of the overall assembly geometric deviation, and (2) avoidance of rework caused by component aggregation. The proposed framework can be carried out for serial-parallel assemblies and for volumetric assemblies utilizing the as-built state in the form of three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data.

While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases.
