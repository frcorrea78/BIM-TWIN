With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960269657

Conventional control strategies of a building heating system such as weather-compensated control cannot make use of the energy supplied to a building (e.g. solar gain in case of sunny day). Moreover dropout of outside temperature can lead to underheating of a building. Presented predictive controller uses both weather forecast and thermal model of a building to inside temperature control. By this, it can utilize thermal capacity of a building and minimize energy consumption. It can also maintain inside temperature at desired level independent of outside weather conditions. Nevertheless, proper identification of the building model is crucial. The models of multiple input multiple output systems (MIMO) can be identified by means of subspace methods. Oftentimes, the measured data used for identification are not satisfactory and need special treatment. During the 2009/2010 heating season, the controller was tested on a large university building and achieved savings of 17-24% compared to the present controller. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These physical data, while providing pivotal information for multiple components of a production system, also bring in severe privacy issues for both workers and manufacturers, thus aggravating the challenges for data sharing. Current designs tend to simplify the behaviors of participants for better theoretical analysis, and they cannot properly handle the challenges in IIoTs where the behaviors are more complicated and correlated. Therefore, this paper proposes a privacy-preserved data sharing framework for IIoTs, where multiple competing data consumers exist in different stages of the system. The framework allows data contributors to share their contents upon requests. The uploaded contents will be perturbed to preserve the sensitive status of contributors. The differential privacy is adopted in the perturbation to guarantee the privacy preservation. Then the data collector will process and relay contents with subsequent data consumers. This data collector will gain both its own data utility and extra profits in data relay. Two algorithms are proposed for data sharing in different scenarios, based on whether the service provider will further process the contents to retain its exclusive utility. This work also provides for both algorithms a comprehensive consideration on privacy, data utility, bandwidth efficiency, payment, and rationality for data sharing.

Facing the vast amounts of IoT information data, the IoT search technology is used to quickly find accurate information to meet the real-time search needs of users. However, IoT search requires using a large amount of user private information, such as personal health information, location information, and social relations information, to provide personalized services. Employing private information from users will encounter security problems if an effective access control mechanism is missing during the IoT search process. An access control mechanism can effectively monitor the access activities of resources and ensure that authorized users access information resources under legitimate conditions.

Clustering techniques are widely applied to improve network performance during the routing phase for WSN. However, existing clustering methods still have some drawbacks such as uneven distribution of cluster heads (CH) and unbalanced energy consumption. Recently, much attention has been paid to intelligent clustering methods based on machine learning to solve the above issues. In this paper, an affinity propagation-based self-adaptive (APSA) clustering method is presented. The advantage of K-medoids, which is a traditional machine learning algorithm, is combined with the affinity propagation (AP) method to achieve more reasonable clustering performance. AP is firstly utilized to determine the number of CHs and to search for the optimal initial cluster centers for K-medoids. Then the modified K-medoids is utilized to form the topology of the network by iteration. The presented method effectively avoids the weakness of the traditional K-medoids in aspects of the homogeneous clustering and convergence rate. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms some latest work such as the unequal cluster-based routing scheme for multi-level heterogeneous WSN (UCR-H), the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy using affinity propagation (LEACH-AP) algorithm, and the energy degree distance unequal clustering (EDDUCA) algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.

To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry.

This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model.

However, advanced applications of these technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) businesses remain nascent. While it is in demand, the use of these technologies in developing the AEC digital pedagogy and for improving professional competence have received little attention. This paper presents a set of five novel digital technologies utilising virtual and augmented reality and digital twin, which adds value to the literature by showing their usefulness in the delivery of construction courses. The project involved designing, developing, and implementing a construction augmented reality (AR), including Piling AR (PAR) and a virtual tunnel boring machine (VTBM) module. The PAR is a smartphone module that presents different elements of a building structure, the footing system, and required equipment for footing construction. VTBM is developed as a multiplayer and avatar-included module for experiencing mechanisms of a tunnel boring machine. The novelty of this project is that it developed innovative immersive construction modules, practices of implementing digital pedagogy, and presenting the capacity of virtual technologies for education. This paper is also highly valuable to educators since it shows how a set of simple to complex technologies can be used for teaching various courses from a distance, either in emergencies such as corona virus disease (COVID-19) or as a part of regular teaching.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

The main contribution of this research article is to propose an efficient solar energy harvesting solution to the limited battery energy problem of WSN nodes by utilizing ambient solar photovoltaic energy. Ideally, the Optimized Solar Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network (SEH-WSN) nodes should operate for an infinite network lifetime (in years). In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient solar energy harvesting system with pulse width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for WSN nodes. The research focus is to increase the overall harvesting system efficiency, which further depends upon solar panel efficiency, PWM efficiency, and MPPT efficiency. Several models for solar energy harvester system have been designed and iterative simulations were performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK for solar powered DC-DC converters with PWM and MPPT to achieve optimum results.

As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085651159

Due to varying routes and a high variance of workpieces, material flows in cyber-physical production systems can get highly complex, which can lead to physically induced disturbances that can result in accidents or decreased throughput and high costs. This issue can be addressed by applying a physics engine to simulate the physical interaction between workpieces and the material handling systems during the operation. Connecting such a digital model to a real material handling system in order to derive simulation-based decision support leads to the concept of digital twins. To date, few practical implementations of digital twins in manufacturing outside the machine tool domain were reported. Therefore, this paper describes the modeling and the subsequent implementation of an integrated system that consists of a real material handling system and its digital twin, based on physics simulation.

Domain concept extraction is critical to the construction of domain knowledge graphs. Although there have been some works that have extracted concepts, semantic information has not been fully used. However, the excellent concept extraction results can be obtained by making full use of semantic information. In this article, a novel concept extraction method, Semantic Graph-Based Concept Extraction (SGCCE), is proposed. First, the similarities between terms are calculated using the word co-occurrence, the LDA topic model and Word2Vec. Then, a semantic graph of terms is constructed based on the similarities between the terms. Finally, according to the semantic graph of the terms, community detection algorithms are used to divide the terms into different communities where each community acts as a concept. In the experiments, we compare the concept extraction results that are obtained by different community detection algorithms to analyze the different semantic graphs.
