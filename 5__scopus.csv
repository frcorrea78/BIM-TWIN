Thus creating a service that would enable the end-user to use multiple of nDs such as, 3D (three dimensional modelling), 4D (time - programming), 5D (costing) and 6D (sustainability) actions asynchronously.

Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of BIM adoption in construction was first presented. Research data, collected from 80 SMOs in Australia through a conducted survey, are then analysed. Descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate SMOs’ understanding of BIM, and to qualify the correlations among the proposed latent variables impacting BIM implementation at SMOs, respectively. Additionally, this study used χ2 test to compare differences between BIM users and non-BIM users regarding BIM understanding, interested applications and attitudes towards implementation benefits and challenges. Findings: Potential benefits associated with BIM implementation are a major motivation factor when it comes to BIM adoption at SMOs. In addition, existing staff’s capability in using BIM tools positively affects the establishment of an organisational knowledge-support system, which determines the decision of adopting BIM eventually. Ultimately, there is a need for further emphasis on staff engagement in the implementation process. Research limitations/implications: The results presented in this paper are applicable to SMOs in the building sector of construction. BIM implementation at organisations involved in non-building activities, including civil works and infrastructure, needs to be assessed in the future. Practical implications: The results indicate that rather than placing the focus mainly on benefits of BIM implementation, successful implementation of BIM in practice requires adequate effort to assess implementation problems, establish knowledge support and engage staff in using BIM. Originality/value: Results of this study provide an insight into the adoption challenges of BIM in SMOs, given that the focus of previous studies has been mostly placed on BIM adoption in architectural firms and large contractors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052556075

The use of BIM technology in the commercial construction industry has grown enormously in recent years. Its application to FM, however, is still limited. The literature highlights issues that hinder BIM–FM integration, which are studied and discussed in detail in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature is conducted to identify and categorize key issues hampering the application of BIM to FM. This paper has also designed a questionnaire based on a literature review and surveyed FM professionals at two industry events. Using the collected responses, these issues are analyzed and discussed using non-parametric statistical analyses. Findings: A total of 16 issues are identified through the literature review of 54 studies under the four categories of BIM-execution and information-management, technological, cost-based and legal and contractual issues. The results of the survey of FM professionals (with 57 complete responses) reveal that the single most important issue is the lack of FM involvement in project phases when BIM is evolving. Originality/value: The findings of this study could assist the construction industry (e.g. building-material and equipment manufacturers, design professionals, general contractors, construction managers, owners and facility managers) with creating guidelines that would help in BIM–FM integration.

However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product.

In the context of buildings and civil infrastructure, the notion of a digital twin remains ill-defined, with little or no consensus among researchers and practitioners of the ways in which digital twin processes and data-centric technologies can support design and construction. This paper builds on existing concepts of Building Information Modeling (BIM), lean project production systems, automated data acquisition from construction sites and supply chains, and artificial intelligence to formulate a mode of construction that applies digital twin information systems to achieve closed loop control systems. It contributes a set of four core information and control concepts for digital twin construction (DTC), which define the dimensions of the conceptual space for the information used in DTC workflows. Working from the core concepts, we propose a DTC information system workflow-including information stores, information processing functions, and monitoring technologies-according to three concentric control workflow cycles.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge.

The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset Information Models (AM) to fulfil the owner's requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building.

Validation methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment. The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the validation of the different AIM's data deliverables. The visualisation of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment.

However, recent research on building information modelling (BIM) reported organizational challenges arising from digital integration. This suggests a need to develop a critical perspective on digital-integration-driven organizational change. Adopting a practice-based approach, this paper exposes the practice-level phenomenon responsible for the ongoing change to develop a critical understanding and enable better interventions. The concepts of ‘simplification’ and ‘systematization’ of digital integration are developed from previous literature and then used to explore and interrelate the practice-level experiences of digital integration (i.e. the experience of the change from within) and the emerging patterns of interactions (i.e. the picture of the change from outside) in a BIM-enabled design project. The concept of ‘ordering in disguise’ is proposed to capture this phenomenon. It shows that practitioners experience digital integration as various task-specific instances of unresponsive technology. However, they are unaware that their ongoing efforts to accommodate it actually further reinforce digital integration’s simplification and systematization. This makes the unresponsiveness of technology harder to challenge, and ultimately forces the organization to change and adapt to it.

It can bring benefits such as simulation, monitoring or management once it joins the physical and the virtual through the Internet of Things. This concept is being adopted more and more in the academia and in the industry, but there is still a lack of methods to define and formalize the representation of the Digital Twin, as for example semantic models. Ontologies are a way of representing knowledge that can be shared between different entities, allowing a common understanding about a information. In this sense, this work proposes an ontology to represent Digital Twin in the context of CPS and embedded systems. These concepts are implemented through a proposed architecture. The proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies and some of the preliminary results are described in the paper. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065093309

Nevertheless, the common goal is to cultivate a competent workforce that possesses the desired knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) as the industry is largely embracing BIM. This study explores the project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy in a four-year undergraduate CM curriculum with a special focus on BIM implementation in sustainable design and construction. Through a joint course project, this study examines how PBL may improve critical student learning outcomes (SLOs) pertaining to institutional assessment and program accreditation requirements. Specifically, students in two upper division elective courses collaborated on an ongoing campus project through roleplay as they would in real project teams. Major project deliverables included developing the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification strategy and the BIM project execution plan, performing schematic design, conducting performance simulation for LEED credit compliance, and documenting project information for LEED submittals. Formative and summative assessments were conducted on the PBL pedagogy and the joint course experience in enhancing students' understanding and working knowledge of BIM implementation in the sustainability domain. The joint course project also provided the instructors with opportunities to align course redesign with program accreditation standards. This paper outlines the strategies of implementing and managing a joint course project, and shares various metrics and tools adopted in project evaluation. The results and the findings of this joint course project are expected to shed light on competency-based program assessment and future BIM curriculum innovation. © 2016 The author.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991108322

The objective of this paper is to ascertain the awareness of these technologies, their potential, and any barriers related to the use of different virtual design construction (VDC) tools, such as building information modeling, virtual reality, augmented reality, and geographic information systems, to improve job-site safety in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The paper presents an overview of the GCC construction industry and highlights current safety management practices and problems in the region. The potential of VDC tools for improving job-site safety is discussed and presented. The study has used a questionnaire survey to identify the drivers and barriers of using VDC tools in improving job-site safety management in the GCC region. The results indicated that ""designing emergency and evacuation plans"" and ""fall-hazard prevention strategies"" are the two best safety applications of these tools if used proactively. Similarly, ""lack of knowledge about return on investment for VDC tools"" was considered as the predominant barrier, preventing stakeholders from using these technologies to improve construction safety. These results will help the GCC construction industry to build a strategy for the digitalization of proactive constructability analysis techniques for improving job-site safety. Overall, due to the multilingual dynamics of this region, it is recommended that VDC tools should become more prevalent so that the transfer of safety information and hazard prevention becomes easier, mitigating safety risks. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085940109

A critical issue in the IFC model comparison is establishing the right candidates for comparison, which typically depends upon using Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs). GUIDs are criticised for inconstancies that result because of complex modelling operations and nature of BIM authoring tools that are used to exchange IFC data. This paper presents a signature-matching approach that advocates using dynamic object identities, calculated from the characteristics and attributes of IFC objects, using hash keys that can create a unique signature for an object. Exemplars of creating IFC object signatures are presented. The proposed methodologies for creating IFC object signatures are implemented in a custom-built tool, xBIM Signatures exporter, and are verified using a test case. This research is limited to discussing signatures for IfcBuildingElements and has not considered a level of details and signature weighting of various object characteristics to formulate a robust solution. The proposed signature matching approach can benefit model comparison functionality for model servers and cloud-based collaboration tools. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083562559
