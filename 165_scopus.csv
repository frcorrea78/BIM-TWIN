With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels.

These accidents cause huge losses because most metro construction is located in the center of very congested cities. Therefore, safety management is a priority in the metro construction industry. This paper proposes an approach for safety management using visualization technology. Safety is integrated with the construction management process throughout the project life cycle. Information from the design phase about construction components and scheduling has been gathered to formulate a 4 dimensional (4D) model. Before construction begins, a rule-based tool analyzes this combined information, automatically detects potentially unsafe activities and conditions and provides instructions for correction. More importantly, actual site monitoring data are continuously compared to the 4D model during the construction process. Therefore, the safety status of related components can be continuously visualized in the system as conditions change and potential safety risks evolve. This paper presents a prototype which was developed and verified with a case study of a real project. The results show that the proposed approach can be a tool of collaboration, virtual analysis and prediction for designers, site project managers, safety engineers and other participants. With real-time safety status visualized, it can detect safety risks before and during the construction process and then provide preventive measures. Thus, timely decisions can be made to avoid accidents. This contributes to the success of safety management in the metro construction industry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a digital platform through which project teams can share information better and improve project performance. However, many barriers to BIM adoption exist. The successful alignment of BIM technology with work processes as well as willingness to coordinate among project participants are considered most critical for successful BIM adoption. Lean construction practices address the issue of improving coordination within a project team and provide some recipes for how enhanced coordination can be brought about. While the use of BIM as a mediating intervention to enable effective lean practice implementation as an outcome has been documented, the use of lean practices as mediators for achieving enhanced levels of BIM use has not been adequately studied. This paper attempts to address this gap and understand if and how lean practices can be used to enable BIM adoption. Using an ethnographic action research methodology, two metro rail station projects are studied in India, a country where cost and time overruns in many sectors are much higher than the global average. On one project, building information models were built and an attempt was made to use these models for enhanced decision making. On the second project, the last planner system was implemented for 6 months, after which BIM was introduced on the project. The extent to which BIM was used for effective decision making leading to accurate planning and timely completion of activities was measured. On the first project, BIM was hardly used for decision making. On the second project, lean practices created a culture of coordination that incentivized the planning team to specify the kinds of building information models that were to be built, which would align with challenges faced on site. These models were subsequently debated upon collectively and were used for decision making with regards to planning and sequencing, suggesting enhanced BIM adoption. It is argued that lean practices can enable BIM adoption and the two reinforce each other. This paper contributes to knowledge on BIM adoption by showing how lean practices reduce coordination-related issues within the project organization, paving the way for BIM adoption. Building information modeling in conjunction with lean practices can therefore be used on construction projects to improve project performance. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931042668

The digitization of the construction site allows virtual inspections and information-based analysis of construction phases. Moreover, interoperable BIM tools allow the semi-automatic review of design compliance against normative texts, improving accuracy and reliability of the validation process. The research project aims to define an H&S BIM-based design and validation workflow, specifying the minimum level of requirements and mandatory informative content for the submission of construction site layouts and safety plans.

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model.

Focusing on high-rise building construction, this study explores the development of both academic research and practical application of automation and robotics based on literature and market review. Scientometric and critical literature reviews were conducted to identify and analyze the development of key research areas based on academic publications from the 1980s to present. In the meantime, the development of basic technologies was summarized. The market review surveyed on existing products and developers of construction automation and robotics. By comparing the results of the literature review and market review, four development patterns of academic research and product application were identified, i.e., simultaneous development led by the same party, development at a similar pace with the two sides taking the lead in different aspects, academic research providing basic technologies for product development, and available technologies in academic research with no products found. Then three gaps in this field, i.e., the gap between academic research and products, the gap between products and application, and the gap between the construction industry and the robotics industry, were discussed with corresponding suggestions to narrow the gaps, followed by an outlook for future directions.

The main objective of the research was to develop procedures and use of BIM technology for safety planning, management, and communications, as part of the 4D-construction planning. Piloting BIM-based procedures in real on-going building projects was the main development method used, meaning hands on trials with the state of the art software, consultations and support by the participating companies, and feedback data collection from case projects. All together seven different field trials were carried out to study the possibilities and development needs of BIM technology from the viewpoint of safety. BIM technologies are moving from the worlds of architecture and engineering to the arenas of construction companies and other players in charge of construction operations. 4D-BIM was recognised as a central technology for construction site safety related planning activities, connecting the safety viewpoint more closely to construction planning, enabling visualization of safety arrangements in construction projects at different moments of time, and providing more illustrative site plans for communication. As a starting point it was considered that BIM technologies could present a new way to solve still existing site safety problems. The experiments have been sources for an improved understanding to apply BIM technologies for the purpose of site safety planning and management. The BIM-based site layout plan itself, or as bases for crane reach/collapse analysis, proved to be a versatile and useful visualization source, and is constituting one clear use case of building information modelling in the construction industry. BIM-based falling prevention planning, various 4D visualizations including temporary site equipment and arrangements, as well as visualizations concerning demolition work are in their early stages. However, these seems to have potential to become novel and good visual support for planning, discussing, managing and communicating safety related issues at building site. Additionally, there are existing and arising new technologies that can be used together with BIM-based 3D or 4D material to promote safety, such as information display screens and virtual reality rooms (such as the tested CAVE). However, more experience is needed concerning 4D safety simulation as well as further development of modelling tools such as object libraries, and site progress/status data recording and storing solutions to broaden the use of the BIM-based safety planning in the design-build process.

To tackle this drawback, this study presents a Robotic Prefabrication System (RPS) which employs a new concept called “re-fabrication”: the automatic disassembly of a prefabricated structure and its reconstruction according to a new design. The RPS consists of a software module and a hardware module. First, the software employs the 3D model of a prefabricated structure as input, and returns motor control command output to the hardware. There are two underlying algorithms developed in the software module. First, a novel algorithm automatically compares the old and new models and identifies the components which the two models do not have in common in order to enable disassembly of the original structure and its refabrication into the new design. In addition, an additional novel algorithm computes the optimal refabrication sequence to transform one model into another according to the differences identified. Meanwhile, the hardware module takes the motor control commands as input and executes the appropriate assembly/disassembly operations, and returns the desired refabricated structure in real-time. Validation tests on two lab-scaled prefabricated structures demonstrate that the system successfully generated the desired refabrication sequences and performed all assembly operations with acceptable placement precision. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027496424

As such, in this article we present a cooperative welding cell for structural steel fabrication that is capable of leveraging the Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards to automatically orchestrate the necessary tasks to be allocated to a human operator and a welding robot moving on a linear track. We propose a spatial augmented reality system that projects alignment information into the environment for helping the operator tack weld the beam attachments that will be later on seam welded by the industrial robot. This way we ensure maximum flexibility during the beam assembly stage while also improving the overall productivity and product quality since the operator no longer needs to rely on error prone measurement procedures and he receives his tasks through an immersive interface, relieving him from the burden of analyzing complex manufacturing design specifications. Moreover, no expert robotics knowledge is required to operate our welding cell because all the necessary information is extracted from the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), namely the CAD models and welding sections, allowing our 3D beam perception systems to correct placement errors or beam bending, which coupled with our motion planning and welding pose optimization system ensures that the robot performs its tasks without collisions and as efficiently as possible while maximizing the welding quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067040551

In this work, a BIM (Building Information Model)-based robotic assembly model that contains all the required information for planning was proposed. Image-based 3D modeling was utilized to help the calibration of the robotic assembly scene and building task models. The placement point coordinates of each assembly brick were generated in the robot base coordinate system.

Implementation of 3D printing technology in the construction industry is still in the prototype stage at present. Compared with traditional building construction, 3D printing technology has following potential advantages, Ⅰ.high degree of mechanization, fast construction speed and low cost, Ⅱ. template free construction and less resource consumption, Ⅲ.low labor intensity and labor saving, Ⅳ.the construction process is safe, clean and accurate, Ⅴ.free design, light weight, high strength and multifunction, Ⅵ.highly customized, possible for realizing both standardization and personalization. However, 3D printing construction technology cannot be directly used to traditional common concrete on account of the different construction techniques. Generally, the materials which were treated via layer by layer manner invariably accompany with the defects of low structure and formation of weak joints between material layers. Therefore, impressive efforts have been devoted by researchers in the investigation of material mix proportion, optimum structural design, evaluation criterion and construction technology. Lately, some cases have been reported that the 3D printing technology has been successfully adopted to personalized housing and bridge construction. Successful applications of large-scale 3D printing technology in construction filed, include contour forming crafting, concrete printing crafting, D-type printing crafting and digital fabrication crafting, among which the contour forming crafting has been a mainstream technology. The main features of 3D printing construction technology are summarized as follows: layering concrete based on extrusion, power table-board bonding with binder techniques and reinforcement gridding. In order to meet the requirements of 3D printing technology, the printing materials are required to maintain certain extrudability, buildability, cohesiveness, workable duration and high strength during the printing process. Meanwhile, some enhanced measurements should been taken to insure the safety and reliability of the concrete structures. In addition, with the integration of different technologies, the combination of several technologies may be involved in the application of a specific project.

Despite the large number of research works in digital concrete printing over the last decade, few studies have explored the method of automatic printing path design, specifically designing the printing path by directly extracting building information modeling (BIM) information from the BIM platform in 3DCP. To obtain BIM information and automatically design the printing path, a script package was developed using a single scripting environment called Dynamo, a Revit plug-in. The proposed method was evaluated using the results of simulation and real-time printing. Compared with the conventional method, the simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce data loss from a 3D BIM model to printing path generation.

Subsequently, we sought to determine the safety of local thrombolysis for this particular subset of patients. Patients and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients treated with minimally invasive surgery plus local thrombolysis for intracerebral hemorrhage between November 2013 to December 2015 in an intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Depending upon the vascular images, unruptured intracranial aneurysms were identified. The primary outcome was any of postoperative intracranial rebleeding. The second outcome included the 30-day death and 6-month follow up graded by Modified Rank Scale. Blind abstractors reviewed the medical data and binary logistic regression was performed to investigate the risk factors of poor prognosis. Results: We identified a cohort of consecutive 188 patients, of whom 23 (12.2%) harbored unruptured intracranial aneurysms. There were 28 aneurysms documented in this study, among which 3 were in the posterior circulation. And in total, 20 (11.3%) cases suffered from postoperative hematoma growth, of which 4 were with aneurysms. Additionally,the 30-day mortality after stroke in patients with aneurysms was 8.69% (2/23), comparable to 13.33% in without (22/165,p = 0.744). The proportion of the favorable outcome at 6-month follow-up in patients with aneurysms was comparable to that in without (47.8% versus 48.5%,p = 1.000) Insignificant associations were demonstrated between the unruptured intracranial aneurysms and postoperative intracranial rehemorrhage (p = 0.092), 30-day death(p = 0.588) and poor long-term prognosis (p = 0.332), respectively.
