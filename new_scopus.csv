Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research. © 2020 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082386834

In this paper, we aim to study the expansion of the digital twin in including building life cycle management and explore the benefits and shortcomings of such implementation. In four rounds of experimentation, more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building facade element.

Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097906264

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s.

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years.

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value. In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized. Relying on empirical findings derived from nine projects that examined the efficiency gains and advantages of using a digital systems information model from an engineering to asset management perspective, we construct a generic BDN to visualize the structure of multiple cause-effect relationships that are used to organise the capabilities, changes and benefits that need to be considered prior to adoption.

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations.

This paper builds on existing concepts of Building Information Modeling (BIM), lean project production systems, automated data acquisition from construction sites and supply chains, and artificial intelligence to formulate a mode of construction that applies digital twin information systems to achieve closed loop control systems.

Working from the core concepts, we propose a DTC information system workflow-including information stores, information processing functions, and monitoring technologies-according to three concentric control workflow cycles.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation. Findings: The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage. Originality/value: This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-à-vis theoretical) level.

This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city.

Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain. The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the process while still providing accurate results. Several cases of BIM geo-referencing are presented and discussed. Furthermore, our experiments show that centimetre accurary can be reached in the alignment process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076711893

Furthermore, geospatial data management plays a connecting role between data acquisition, data modelling, data visualization, and data analysis. It enables the continuous availability of geospatial data and the replicability of geospatial data analysis. In the first part of this article, five milestones of geospatial data management research are presented that were achieved during the last decade. The first one reflects advancements in BIM/GIS integration at data, process, and application levels. The second milestone presents theoretical progress by introducing topology as a key concept of geospatial data management. In the third milestone, 3D/4D geospatial data management is described as a key concept for city modelling, including subsurface models. Progress in modelling and visualization of massive geospatial features on web platforms is the fourth milestone which includes discrete global grid systems as an alternative geospatial reference framework. The intensive use of geosensor data sources is the fifth milestone which opens the way to parallel data storage platforms supporting data analysis on geosensors. In the second part of this article, five future directions of geospatial data management research are presented that have the potential to become key research fields of geospatial data management in the next decade. Geo-data science will have the task to extract knowledge from unstructured and structured geospatial data and to bridge the gap between modern information technology concepts and the geo-related sciences. Topology is presented as a powerful and general concept to analyze GIS and BIM data structures and spatial relations that will be of great importance in emerging applications such as smart cities and digital twins. Data-streaming libraries and “in-situ” geo-computing on objects executed directly on the sensors will revolutionize geo-information science and bridge geo-computing with geospatial data management. Advanced geospatial data visualization on web platforms will enable the representation of dynamically changing geospatial features or moving objects’ trajectories. Finally, geospatial data management will support big geospatial data analysis, and graph databases are expected to experience a revival on top of parallel and distributed data stores supporting big geospatial data analysis. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078872365

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform. The demonstrator also includes two applications: (1) improving asset maintenance and asset tracking using Augmented Reality (AR); and (2) equipment failure prediction.

This project aims to conduct a systematic critical review including a bibliography analysis on delay literature in construction. The main questions consider what has been learnt from a decade investigating delay causes and effects in the construction literature and what factors have been missed in the literature. This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt. In addition, the paper identifies 30 critical factors with the frequency of occurrences over three times in the DEC dataset and computes their medians of ranking. This paper also discusses digital tools and methods that can be used for delay analysis and preventions, including MS Project, Oracle Primavera P6, and Open Plan by Deltek. The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas. In total, four overlooked factors are identified and suggested, including faulty data analysis, unmatched structure of the research questionnaires with new knowledge and standards [e.g., Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)], overlooked effects of digital technologies [e.g., Digital twin, Navisworks, Building Information Model (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)], and ignored job-site technologies. In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified.

The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for FM in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages of the building lifecycle is intended to bridge the gap between operations and digital data, but lacks the functionality of assessing and forecasting the state of the built environment in real-time. To accommodate this, BIM data needs to be constantly updated with the current state of the built environment. However, generation of as-is BIM data for a digital representation of a building is a labor intensive process. While some software applications offer a degree of automation for the generation of as-is BIM data, they can be impractical to use for routinely updating digital FM documentation. Current approaches for capturing the built environment using remote sensing and photometry-based methods allow for the creation of 3D point clouds that can be used as basis data for a Digital Twin (DT), along with existing BIM and FM documentation. 3D point clouds themselves do not contain any semantics or specific information about the building components they represent physically, but using machine learning methods they can be enhanced with semantics that would allow for reconstruction of as-is BIM and basis DT data. This paper presents current research and development progress of a service-oriented platform for generation of semantically rich 3D point cloud representations of indoor environments. A specific focus is placed on the reconstruction and visualization of the captured state of the built environment for increasing FM stakeholder engagement and facilitating collaboration. The preliminary results of a prototypical web-based application demonstrate the feasibility of such a platform for FM using a service-oriented paradigm. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054529484

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, moni-toring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling sys-tems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19.

Building information modeling (BIM) offers new opportunities to underpin the computerized design and fabrication of industrialized buildings, providing greater productivity and cost-effectiveness. In this study, attempts are made to review the state-of-the-art BIM applications on design and prefabrication automation of industrialized buildings, with more emphasis on the recent achievement in concrete 3D printing technology. Following this, a BIM method is proposed to support the detailed geometry design and digital fabrication of modular housings. A program interfaced within BIM is developed and demonstrated through discussions on its capacity in generating the geometry details of 3D-printed modules. In addition, robotic simulation of 3D printing is performed to explore a flexible plan in producing the 3D-printed modules or components. The lessons learned from the study are discussed to highlight the future research challenges and opportunities. First, as current Industry Foundation Classes-based BIM model provides limited support to prefabrication, research on BIM open standards demands more attentions to interoperate the computerized design and computer-aided manufacturing. Moreover, today's industrialized buildings consist of sophisticated architectural, structural, and mechanical systems that are intervened across the whole life cycle, more research on the interdependent building systems is needed (via digital twins) to optimize the life cycle performance. When moving towards data-driven decision making, there are research needs to expand Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence to collect the big data from prefabrication, perform predictive analysis, and optimize the control decisions for manufacturing facilities operations.

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories.

Building information modeling (BIM) has been revolutionary in construction industry applications; it integrates different kinds of construction information into a 3D digital model and can be applied in all stages of a project lifecycle. Furthermore, the wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important key technology in Internet of Things (IoT) development. In order to improve the performance of environmental monitoring management of parking garages in smart cities, this study proposes a planning approach for integration of WSN and BIM technologies and develops an advanced monitoring and control system for underground parking garage environment monitoring, adopting WSN and BIM technologies for digital twin (DT) application of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Many WSN nodes with sensing and control capabilities were placed in a parking garage to collect carbon monoxide (CO), temperature, and humidity conditions in real time. All the collected information was transferred by a WSN self-constituted network, and the different location conditions were integrated and dynamically displayed on corresponding spatial components of a 3D BIM model. The proposed system was applied in a case study of a parking garage in Taipei to verify the system and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is a visually effective monitoring system for environmental monitoring management.

Recent advances in technologies such as building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks, augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense opportunity to radically improve the way daily O&M is conducted. This paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants’ thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach: The developed system focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O&M activities such as inspection, recording, communication and verification. Findings: Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an example, the case study demonstrates that the O&M management process can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system. Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site. Originality/value: The originality lies in bringing together the advances in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to support the daily O&M management activities. In particular, the paper presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for visualising those assets with related information. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087569841

It is therefore essential that they are designed, constructed and maintained properly to adapt to changing conditions of use and climate-driven events. With the rapid development in capability of collecting bridge monitoring data, a data challenge emerges due to insufficient capability in managing, processing and interpreting large monitoring datasets to extract useful information which is of practical value to the industry. One emerging area of research which focuses on addressing this challenge is the creation of 'digital twins' for bridges. A digital twin serves as a virtual representation of the physical infrastructure (i.e. the physical twin), which can be updated in near real time as new data is collected, provide feedback into the physical twin and perform 'what-if scenarios for assessing asset risks and predicting asset performance.

Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved. This paper proposes a SC concept to investigate the integration of building information modeling tools with Internet of Things-(IoT)-based wireless sensor networks in the fields of environmental monitoring and emotion detection to provide insights into the level of comfort.

Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety managementmethods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the BeijingWinter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the construction industry lags behind in adapting these ideas, and is still facing severe productivity deficits. This paper addresses these deficits by assessing the hypothesis of Building Information Modeling-as the digital twinning methodology in construction-representing a key driver for digital automation and thus enabling more productive processes. To this end, we apply a design science research approach to develop artefacts using computational methods for the automation of business processes in a configure-to-order industry partner.

Both BIM and IoT are increasingly being used in the construction industry. However, using BIM in conjunction with IoT for sustainability purposes has not received enough attention in construction. In particular, the capability created from the combination of both technologies has not been exploited. There is a growing consensus that the future of construction operation tends to be smart and intelligent, which would be possible by a combination of both information systems and sensors. This investigation aims to find out the recent efforts of utilizing BIM for lean purposes in the last decade by critically reviewing the published literature and identifying dominant clusters of research topics. More specifically, the investigation is further developed by identifying the gaps in the literature to utilize IoT in conjunction with BIM in construction projects to facilitate applying lean techniques in a more efficient way in construction projects. A systematic review method was designed to identify scholarly papers covering both concepts “lean” and “BIM” in construction and possibilities of using IoT. A total of 48 scholarly articles selected from 26 construction journals were carefully reviewed thorough perusal. The key findings were discussed with industry practitioners. The transcriptions were analyzed employing two coding and cluster analysis techniques. The results of the cluster analysis show two main directions, including the recent practice of lean and BIM interactions and issues of lean and BIM adoption. Findings revealed a large synergy between lean and BIM in control interactions and reduction in variations, and surprisingly there are many uncovered areas in this field. The results also show that the capability of IoT is also largely not considered in recent developments. The number of papers covering both lean and BIM is very limited, and there is a large clear gap in understanding synergetic interactions of lean concepts applying in BIM and IoT in specific fields of construction such as sustainable infrastructure projects. © 2020 by the authors.

Its applications to life cycle management of buildings and infrastructures can further increase the social and economic benefits. As a complete information model, a digital twin integrates the information of a project from different stages of the life cycle into a model, in order to facilitate better asset management and communicate through data visualizations with participants. This paper unprecedently introduces a digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station. Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the project is the highest, accounting for 78% of the total cost. However, the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is higher than the amount during the production of building materials, accounting for 67%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66% of the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73% and 17.64%, respectively. In addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life cycle cost and carbon footprint. This initiative is relatively new to the industry. The new insight into life cycle assessment or LCA (especially carbon footprint over the life cycle) integrated with digital twin applications will enable sustainable development that will enhance resilience of metro railway systems globally. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092140180

On the other hand, many Digital Terrain Models (DTM) have been created as 2.5D triangular irregular networks (TIN) or grids for different applications such as water management, sign of view or shadow computation, tourism, land planning, telecommunication, military operations and communications. 3D city models need to represent both the 3D objects and terrain in one consistent model, but still many challenges remain. A critical issue when integrating 3D objects and terrain is the identification of the valid intersection between 2.5D terrain and 3D objects.

At present, buildings are responsible for 40% of the energy consumption in Europe and, so, there is a growing interest in reducing their energy use. In this context, proper interoperability between BIM and building energy model (BEM) is paramount for integrating the digital world into the construction sector and, therefore, increasing competitiveness by saving costs. This paper evaluates whether there is an automated or semi-automated BIM to BEM workflow that could improve the building design process. For this purpose, a residential building and a warehouse are constructed using the same BIM authoring tool (Revit), where two open schemas were used: green building extensible markup language (gbXML) and industry foundation classes (IFC). These transfer files were imported into software compatible with the EnergyPlus engine—Design Builder, Open Studio, and CYPETHERM HE—in which simulations were performed. Our results showed that the energy models were built up to 7.50% smaller than in the BIM and with missing elements in their thermal envelope. Nevertheless, the materials were properly transferred to gbXML and IFC formats. Moreover, the simulation results revealed a huge difference in values between the models generated by the open schemas, in the range of 6 to 900 times. Overall, we conclude that there exists a semi-automated workflow from BIM to BEM which does not work well for big and complex buildings, as they present major problems when creating the energy model. Furthermore, most of the issues encountered in BEM were errors in the transfer of BIM data to gbXML and IFC files. Therefore, we emphasise the need to improve compatibility between BIM and model exchange formats by their developers, in order to promote BIM–BEM interoperability. © 2021 by the authors.

The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure.

Cyclic inspections by hand according to DIN 1076 are the basis for planning maintenance and repair measures for our engineering structures. The calculation of condition ratings is performed based on detected deficiencies. The documentation of the inspection is done primarily within the program system SIB-BW. The system offers a comparably uniform rating standard and enables a limited retrospective and prospective view for maintenance planning. New developments like BIM or continuous, sensor-based monitoring, which is established in other branches, are not yet conceptually integrated. In light of the digital transformation the question arises how the well established manual and the digital assessment as well as BIM generated data can be unified within one continuous process chain and which benefits can by created by doing so. Therefore, the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) has initiated the “smartBridge Hamburg” project which prototypically tests the concept of the digital twin using the Koehlbrandbruecke in Hamburg. The digital twin is used to conceptually unify the BI-model as well as analogue and electronic assessment data and to provide aggregated data in a form that meets the needs of different user groups.

Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, bIm can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, bIm is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility management (Fm). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in Fm. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of Fm operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image recognition (Imr), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data. This data has been stored in a bIm model, employed as single reliable source of information for Fm. This integration can enhance maintenance management contracts if the bIm model is coupled with a smart contract. Far from being a comprehensive case study, this research demonstrates how the transition from bIm to the Asset Information model (AIm) and, finally, to the Digital Twin (i.e. a near-real-time digital clone of a physical asset, of its conditions and processes) is desirable because of the outstanding benefits that have already been measured in other industrial sectors by applying the principles of Industry 4.0. © 2019 WIT Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085259636

A linear static analysis was performed to investigate the instantaneous impacts of dead and wind loads on the complex concrete structure which was completed in 1973. A quasistatic analysis was performed to predict the effects of creep and shrinkage due to dead load on the structure in 2050 to discern its longevity. In 2050, the Sydney Opera House is expected to experience 0.090% element strain due to creep and shrinkage and therefore suffer prestress losses of 32.59 kN per strand. However, given that the current time after prestress loading is approximately 50 years, the majority of creep and shrinkage effects have already taken place with 0.088% strain and 32.12 kN of prestress losses. The analysis concludes that very minor structural impacts are expected over the next 30 years due to creep and shrinkage, suggesting a change in conservation focus from large structural concerns to inspection and maintenance of minor issues of surface cracking and water ingress. The analysis is the first step in the application of more complex finite element modelling of the structure with the integration of complex building information models.

Buidling under heavy weather is seldom beneficial, but common practice on site. It promotes inaccuracies and impairs the use of modern but sensible high-performance materials and costs time, since disruption in construction frequently causes complicated returns to the planning process. Nevertheless, a handcrafted production process is still considered the one and only alternative since all buildings are unique and thus must be manually constructed on site. Indeed? The priority program entitled “Adaptive modularised constructions made in a flux” funded by the German Research Foundation follows a completely new approach. Buildings are divided into similar modular precast concrete elements, prefabricated in flow production, quality assured, and just-in-time assembled on site. Comparable to puzzles with many pieces, the uniqueness of the structure is maintained. The motto is: “Individuality on a large scale - similarity on a small scale”. The contribution presents approaches of modularisation, production concepts, and linking digital models. Serial, stationary prefabrication enables short production times and resource-efficient modules that are assembled to load-bearing structures with low geometrical deviations. Stringent digitalisation ensures high quality of all intermediate steps. These comprise fabrication, assembly, and the whole service life of the structure.

The procedure of documentation requires a very diverse range of data (quantitative and qualitative) to be obtained and investigated in order to produce an accurate digital representation of the building. This type of work of data capture and interpretation is often conducted in isolation by different stakeholders and for a range of purposes, leading to a lack of communication between different data types, repeated effort and incomplete documentation. Heritage Building Information Modelling (H-BIM) is set to play a key role in the digital documentation of heritage buildings, as it can combine quantitative and qualitative data and facilitate the integration of different stakeholders and specialised data into the digital management of the different phases of dealing with heritage buildings. This paper aims to review the multitude of data types that could be included in the documentation and investigation process of the built heritage, in order to assess the breadth and depth by which heritage buildings can be documented. Four main categories that span the whole documentation data areas are being suggested which vary from outer geometry surveys, to subsurface materials and structural integrity investigations, to data concerning the building performance, as well as the historic records concerning the building’s morphology over time, which can help to create a more in-depth knowledge about the heritage building’s status and performance and can create a solid base for any required restoration and retrofitting processes (Khalil and Stravoravdis 2019a). © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085990379

A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an amalgamation of computation, networking and physical objects. There are various examples of CPS being employed in sectors varying from manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities. Where the application and literature are lacking, however, is construction. This paper focuses on construction machinery operation and work tracking through CPS. The relevant technologies required for creating a system with these capabilities are Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twin (DT). Two salient features of a CPS are real-time state knowledge and control. These are handled by the sensors and micro-controllers, respectively, allowing for bi-directional communication between the virtual models and physical objects. Remote control and tracking/monitoring of construction machinery can expedite certain on-site processes such as operations logging and 4D BIM, while improving operation precision and safety.

It is difficult to simultaneously solve the temporal, spatial, and exogenous dependencies between pavement performance data and maintenance, the service life of highways, the environment, and other factors. Digital twin technology based on the building information modeling (BIM) model, combined with machine learning, puts forward a new perspective and method for the accurate and timely prediction of pavement performance. In this paper, we propose a highway tunnel pavement performance prediction approach based on a digital twin and multiple time series stacking (MTSS). This paper (1) establishes an MTSS prediction model with heterogeneous stacking of eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), ridge regression, and support vector regression (SVR) component learners after exploratory data analysis (EDA); (2) proposes a method based on multiple time series feature extraction to accurately predict the pavement performance change trend, using the highway segment as the minimum computing unit and considering multiple factors; (3) uses grid search with the k-fold cross validation method to optimize hyperparameters to ensure the robustness, stability, and generalization ability of the prediction model; and (4) constructs a digital twin for pavement performance prediction to realize the real-time dynamic evolution of prediction. The method proposed in this study is applied in the life cycle management of the Dalian highway-crossing tunnel in Shanghai, China. A dataset covering 2010-2019 is collected for real-time prediction of the pavement performance. The prediction accuracy evaluation shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.1314, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.0386, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 5.10%, and the accuracy is 94.90%. Its overall performance is better than a single model. The results verify that the prediction method based on digital twin and MTSS is feasible and effective in the highway tunnel pavement performance prediction. © 2020 Gang Yu et al.

At present, many studies focus on the capture of geometry for the modelling of primary components, overlooking the fact that many recurring actions need to be conducted on assets inside buildings. Furthermore, highly accurate survey techniques like laser scanning need long offsite processing for object recognition. Performing such process on site would dramatically impact efficiency and also prevent the need to revisit the site in the case of insufficient/incomplete data. In this paper, an Augmented Reality (AR) system is proposed enabling inventory, information retrieval and information update directly on-site. It would reduce post-processing work and avoid loss of information and unreliability of data. The system has a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) AR interface that lets the technician interact hands-free with the real world and digital information contained in the BIM/AIM. A trained Deep Learning Neural Network operates the automatic recognition of objects in the field of view of the user and their placement into the digital BIM. In this paper, two uses cases are described: one is the inventory of small assets inside buildings to populate a BIM/AIM, and the second is the retrieval of relevant information from the AIM to support maintenance operations. Partial development and feasibility tests of the first use case applied to fire extinguishers, have been carried out to assess the feasibility and value of this system. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

However, the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase of a building’s life cycle is the most expensive. Smart buildings already use BIM (Building Information Modeling) for facility management, but they lack the predictive capabilities of DT. On the other hand, the use of extended reality (XR) technologies to improve maintenance operations has been a major topic of academic research in recent years, both through data display and remote collaboration. In this context, this paper focuses on reviewing projects using a combination of these technologies to improve maintenance operations in smart buildings. This review uses a combination of at least three of the terms ""Digital Twin”, “Maintenance”, “BIM” and “Extended Reality”. Results show how a BIM can be used to create a DT and how this DT use combined with XR technologies can improve maintenance operations in a smart building.

However, schedule deviation risks in the logistics process of modular construction can derail its benefits and thus interfere with its widespread application. To address this issue, we aim to develop a digital twin framework for real-time logistics simulation, which can predict potential logistics risks and accurate module arrival time. The digital twin, a virtual replica of the physical module, updates its virtual asset based on building information modeling (BIM) in near real-time using internet of thing (IoT) sensors. Then, the virtual asset is transferred and exploited for logistics simulation in a geographic information system (GIS)-based routing application. We tested this framework in a case project where modules are manufactured at a factory, delivered to the site via a truck, and assembled onsite. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin framework. This paper’s primary contribution is the development of a framework that mediates IoT, BIM, and GIS for reliable simulation which predicts potential logistics risks and accurate module delivery time. Such reliable risk prediction enables effective supply chain coordination, which can improve project performance and the widespread application of modular construction. © 2021 by the authors.

Internet of Things (IoT) sensors make available a high quantity of data on energy consumptions and indoor conditions of an existing building that can drive the choice of energy retrofit interventions. Moreover, the current developments in the topic of the digital twin are leading the diffusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods and tools that can provide valid support to manage all data and information for the retrofit process. This paper shows the aim and the findings of research focused on testing the integrated use of BIM methodology and IoT systems. A common data platform for the visualization of building indoor conditions (e.g., temperature, luminance etc.) and of energy consumption parameters was carried out. This platform, tested on a case study located in Italy, is developed with the integration of low-cost IoT sensors and the Revit model. To obtain a dynamic and automated exchange of data between the sensors and the BIM model, the Revit software was integrated with the Dynamo visual programming platform and with a specific Application Programming Interface (API). It is an easy and straightforward tool that can provide building managers with real-time data and information about the energy consumption and the indoor conditions of buildings, but also allows for viewing of the historical sensor data table and creating graphical historical sensor data. Furthermore, the BIM model allows the management of other useful information about the building, such as dimensional data, functions, characteristics of the components of the building, maintenance status etc., which are essential for a much more conscious, effective and accurate management of the building and for defining the most suitable retrofit scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107992986

The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment. These include: (1) additive/robotic manufacturing, (2) artificial intelligence, (3) big data and analytics, (4) blockchain technology, (5) building information modelling, (6) digital platforms/marketplaces, (7) digital twins, (8) the geographical information system, (9) material passports/databanks, and (10) the internet of things. The framework provides a fruitful starting point for the novel research avenue at the intersection of circular economy, digital technology and the built environment, and gives practitioners inspiration for sustainable innovation in the sector. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107657070

Using SRM originating from recycling a broad range of inorganic waste materials (e.g., mining waste, different industrial wastes, construction, and demolition waste) has been recognized as a promising, generally more cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to the exploitation of natural resources. Despite the benefits of using SRM, several challenges need to be addressed before using SRM even more. One of them is the long-term durability and little-known response of construction works built using such alternative materials. In this paper, we present the activities to establish a fully functioning digital twin (DT) of a road constructed using SRM.

Asset owners are given the opportunity to become additionally owners of digital assets, while the need for conceptual approaches and digital asset management is growing. With the increasing application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for asset management within architecture, engineering, construction and owner-operated (AECO) sector, BIM-enabled asset management has been increasingly attracting more attentions in both research and practice. The problem associated with the development and production of facilities is related to the discrepancy between as-built as-designed and as-is facilities or complex technical systems. During the stages of design, construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), the actually manufactured (i.e. as-built) complex technical object (or production infrastructure) differs, sometimes significantly, from the designed (as-designed), and at the same time inconsistency between the created production and production infrastructure within which it should operate grows. Solving the problem of discrepancy between the actually created and designed facility or the complex technical system, in the absence of digital technologies, requires considerable time for the so-called ""trial operation"", during which the discrepancies are eliminated and a mechanism for managing production and production infrastructure in real conditions is developed. With the development of the digital economy, the need for digitalization of asset management is growing. An analysis of existing information technologies shows that there is a possibility of reducing the cost of production and operation of an asset by concentrating the main costs at the design stage. The article discusses basic approaches to organizing the lifecycle management of technical systems, production and infrastructure in the context of global digitalization which become a useful tool for reduction of trial operation time.

However, due to inherent safety and trust-related concerns, human-robot collaborative work is subject to strict safety standards that require robot motion and forces to be sensitive to proximate human workers. Robot simulations in online digital twins can be used to extend designed construction models, such as BIM, to the construction phase for real-time monitoring of robot motion planning and control. Robots plan work tasks and execute them in the digital twin simulations allowing humans to review and approve robot trajectories. Once approved, commands can be sent to the physical robots to perform the tasks. This paper discusses the development of a system to bridge robot simulations and physical robots in construction and digital fabrication. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is leveraged as the primary framework for bi-directional communication and Gazebo is used for robot simulations. The virtual robots in Gazebo receive work tasks from a BIM model to plan their trajectories, and then send the commands to the physical robots for execution. The system is implemented with a digital fabrication case study with a fullscale mobile KUKA KR120 six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm mounted on a track system for an additional degree-offreedom, and evaluated by comparing the pose between the physical robot and the virtual robot. The results show a high accuracy of the pose synchronization between two robots, which provide the opportunity for further deploying to real construction sites. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

The research focuses on timber technologies and prefabricated timber components, which are frequently selected in preference to other industrialised building systems because of the advantages they offer in terms of weight, workability and sustainability strategies. A knowledge-based engineering methodology is explored for the design of prefabricated timber-framed external walls, encoding both “explicit” and “tacit” knowledge into a digital three-dimensional model. Results demonstrate how such an approach could significantly change common design practices by shifting the major phase of design effort to earlier stages in the project cycle, thereby minimising re-work, reducing data fragmentation and potentially removing the need for drawings. A key finding of this paper is that model interoperability, maintenance and reuse becomes unlikely if an agreed methodology, including a description logic, is not adopted.

However, the existing methods have promi-nently been challenged by (i) the high cost of data collection for numerous existing buildings and (ii) the computational complexity from self-similar layout patterns. This paper studies the registration of two low-cost data sets, i.e., colorful 3D point clouds captured by smartphones and 2D CAD drawings, for resolving the first challenge. We propose a novel method named ‘Registration based on Architectural Reflection Detection’ (RegARD) for transforming the self-symmetries in the second challenge from a barrier of coarse registration to a facilitator. First, RegARD detects the innate architectural reflection symmetries to constrain the rotations and reduce degrees of freedom. Then, a nonlinear optimization formulation together with advanced optimization algorithms can overcome the second challenge. As a result, high-quality coarse registration and subsequent low-cost DTBs can be created with semantic components and realistic appearances. Experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed existing methods considerably in both effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., 49.88% less error and 73.13% less time, on average. The RegARD presented in this paper first contributes to coarse registration theories and exploitation of symmetries and textures in 3D point clouds and 2D CAD drawings.

Enterprise BIM (EBIM) is an emerging, unexplored, holistic organizational concept that is designed to support and optimize business management throughout the entire life-cycles of buildings and infrastructure. However, current understanding and implementation of EBIM is rare. To fix this gap in knowledge, this paper defines the EBIM concept and assesses associated perspectives from research and practice in order to integrate BIM more strongly into the enterprise's core processes and other needs at different levels within the organization and externally. To achieve a higher and more efficient utilization of building data, however, EBIMs need to develop a clear life-cycle-based information management strategy, including coordination and communication between all stakeholders. The paper highlights and discusses the importance of both available and missing standards related to the effective implementation of EBIM.

Furthermore, the EBIM concept is contextualized by providing a case study with focus on cleaning. This study identifies a need to develop best practices in interdisciplinary collaborative projects.

This can act as a barrier for the submission of feedback and thus cause the facility management to remain unaware of unsatisfactory comfort conditions or faults, which can result in further issues and costs. In order to reduce the submission effort, a novel software-based solution is proposed, which automatically determines the most probable complaints, suggests them to the user and, when possible, automatically solves them. This is achieved by employing detailed context information stemming from a Building Information Model, the Building Automation System and past complaints submitted by the occupants. This information is integrated and represented with semantic technologies, which allow to formally organize the information and describe the relationships between the data. The solution was implemented as an app and was demonstrated in a real office environment. The reduced effort of submitting feedback via the app led to a strong increase in the submission of comfort-related complaints, showing the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093358222

Robotization of field construction work must thus be conceived as a collaborative human-robot endeavor capable of planning and improvising during the performance of construction tasks. Although humans can control robot motion through teleoperation, it is often impractical due to the range of a robot's motion and associated safety issues arising from heavy or large construction materials. An intuitive and safe bi-directional interface is thus needed to enable construction robots to seamlessly interact with and partner with human co-workers. This paper proposes a framework that allows human-robot interaction and collaboration within a real-time, process-level, immersive virtual reality (VR) digital twin that is created by combining the as-designed BIM model and the evolving as-built workspace geometry obtained from on-site sensors. Humans can use the digital twin to remotely demonstrate a task plan to the robot. The robot understands the communicated objectives and plans its motion to complete the task, which is communicated back through the system for human evaluation and approval before the robot executes the task. A case study involving imperfect rough carpentry (i.e., stud framing) and a 6DOF KUKA drywall-installing robot arm is conducted to demonstrate and evaluate the digital twin system. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

Many standards, databases, and tools have been developed for achieving a sustainable building. Not until recently have the importance of structural engineering and its contribution to sustainable building design been full recognised. However, due to the highly fragmented and diversity of knowledge across building and infrastructure domains, there is a lack of approach that can address all the sustainable issues within the structural design. This paper reviews the sustainable design from the perspective of structural engineering: (1) reviewing the current situation; (2) identifying the gaps and difficulties; and (3) making recommendations for future improvements. The strategies and indicators, as well as BIM-enabled methodology, for sustainable structural design (SSD) are also discussed in a holistic way. The results of this investigation show that most of the methods are not doing well in terms of delivering a successful sustainable structural design. It is expected that the future BIM could probably provide such a platform to address these issues. Copyright © 2020 Jisong Zhang et al.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106795456

The approach involves incor-porating game design and a building information modelling (BIM) digital twin of a purposed CE prototype building. Our novel approach introduces VR environments designed to provide a visual representation of materials and components that can be reintroduced into the supply chain at the end of life and their removal procedures and material provenance. A case study methodology was applied to a purposely designed CE building, namely the Legacy Living Lab (L3). To reflect the real-life building, L3’s BIM model was combined with Unify game software to advance the literature in three key areas. First, the research investigates VR tools that will allow building designers to view and implement their strategies to advance CE design. Second, this research proposes an advanced VR tool to visualise the bill of quantities (BoQ) and material stock embedded in the studied building, further understanding concepts such as buildings as material banks. Finally, the proposed VR environment defines CE techniques implemented within the case study to be disseminated across the vast construction industry. This VR research identifies three key pillars in reducing the waste gen-erated by the construction industry: education, documentation and visualisation.

This paper presents a compact review about digital twins for PED from aspects of concepts, working principles, tools/platforms, and applications, in order to address the issues of both how a digital PED twin is made and what tools can be used for a digital PED twin. Four key components of digital PED twin are identified, i.e., a virtual model, sensor network integration, data analytics, and a stakeholder layer. Very few available tools now have full functions for digital PED twin, while most tools either have a focus on industrial applications or are designed for data collection, communication and visualization based on building information models (BIM) or geographical information system (GIS). Several observations gained from successful application are that current digital PED twins can be categorized into three tiers: (1) an enhanced version of BIM model only, (2) semantic platforms for data flow, and (3) big data analysis and feedback operation. Further challenges and opportunities are found in areas of data analysis and semantic interoperability, business models, data security, and management. The outcome of the review is expected to provide useful information for further development of digital PED twins and optimizing its sustainability.

Predictive maintenance of building facilities requires continuously updated data on construction components to be acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration, IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of maintenance management system on the IoT and building information modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to moni-tor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities’ conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition.

The previous applications of new digital methods (BIM) in infrastructure construction have led to the realization that merely a building information model is not sufficient for the ambitious goals of an optimized planning process and, as a result, optimized construction management. Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the ideal case of a “digital twin”. The modeling of the ground goes beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major international projects clearly show that the optimization of construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the three submodels ground, building and construction site.

The application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape currently available for the construction industry across the various project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different software application areas, software architecture, interoperability possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated solutions addressed to advanced computer users.

Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117799886

The project is aimed at integrating Construction 4.0 content to a recently started new degree on Technologies on Civil Engineering. This integration is underpinned by the creation of STEAM-rich activities that can complement such degree. The philosophical design of these activities followed three requirements: (i) the activities should infuse Construction 4.0-related technologies, (ii) the activities should foster motivation among students with a STEAM vision by-design and (iii) the activities should be designed with a hardware-software independent perspective (open-source, accessible, affordable). Cornerstone and capstone projects as well as a set of workshops represent the demonstrators of these activities. All these demonstrators are knitted together in a single path in which an educational attempt to fill the identified Construction 4.0 gaps is proposed. The STEAM perspective provides completeness to the whole development. During the last two years, the project was developed and the design, the development and implementation of several demonstrators were completed.

Two low-cost dust sensors (Sharp GP2Y1014AU0F and Alphasense OPC N2) without implementing control measures to explicitly evaluate, compare and gauge them for these construction activities were utilized. The mean exposures to PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 during both activities were 3522.62, 236.46 and 47.62 µg/m3 and 6762.72, 471.30 and 59.09 µg/m3, respectively.

Accordingly, a step forward from the traditional management approach towards a shared and highly integrated model capable of including the various monitoring and maintenance phases along with economic, operational, and environmental concerns, is required. This study aims at investigating the potential of an interoperable and upgradeable BIM model supplemented by non-destructive pavement survey data, such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS) data, and satellite Remote Sensing information (i.e. InSAR). The main goal of the research is to contribute to the state-of-The-Art knowledge on BIM applications, by testing an infrastructure management platform capable of minimizing, or in some cases totally removing, the limitations typically related to the separate observation of these assessments to the advantage of an integrated analysis including both the design information and the routinely updated results of monitoring activities. As a test to the proposed methodology, an experimental activity was conducted over a real highway infrastructure, that was parallelly inspected by GPR, MLS and InSAR. To the purpose of the study, the raw dataset from the three surveys were separately processed, scaled and converted into suitable file formats to be more rapidly implemented into the BIM environment. As a result, the synergistic use of geometric and design information with the results from monitoring activities allowed the definition of a Digital Twin Model of the investigated road infrastructure, which can be progressively updated at each new survey, thereby permitting to detect pavement distresses and to control their evolution over time, while being aware of the effect of any delay in maintenance activities.

Throughout the entire life cycle, digital scans of changing damages and the building geometry, up to the degree of a digital twin, can be acquired using modern inspection methods. This allows for the automation of condition assessment processes to locate, quantify and predict damage progression at a structure related to building information models. However, the usual inspection documentation as performed in the past neither includes an assignment of damages to digital building models nor relates the history of recordings to a damage entity, which consequently makes a direct condition state comparison unfeasible. The paper presents voxel based methods for the automated assignment of geometrical representations of damages to elements of a corresponding building model as well as to past damage scans, which describe the same damage entity. Furthermore, the comparison and computation of discrete geometric changes based on the assignments is shown. Additionally, the clustering of scanned damage geometries into interest areas for the usage in planning processes for further inspections is presented.

It contains geometric data in the form of a 3D model and non-geometry data, including construction management and support documents. The BIM model allows access to building usage information. The information obtained is more accurate. It keeps building element information up to date, enabling more informed decisions. It supports comparison of different solutions and their energy needs. Renovation can be done more efficiently. Construction information is up-to-date, so we can use the time needed to process different solutions instead of finding the necessary information about the construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097096733

Despite that potential of BIM is higher in industrialized housebuilding, the trade express similar characteristics as traditional construction both in terms of BIM sue but also organization of assets. The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for digital development in industrialized timber housing. Data were gathered from eight industrialized housebuilding companies in a mixed approach with interviews, focus groups and a survey. The analysis presents the current use of BIM and digital tools and prioritized development areas within this domain. By adding a theoretical overview of current research for industrialized housebuilding with focus on platform strategies and digital development a framework is drawn. Problems with transfer in the interfaces between software were emphasized. Current research on developing a system for Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in industrialized housebuilding indicate a path forward. A PLM system facilitates the development of digital developments such as digital twins and smart products, which possess the potentials to generate crucial feedback, which is crucial for the competitiveness and efficiency of industrialized housebuilding.

BIM is at the same time a tool for planning, evaluation, monitoring and documentation; however, some constraints determine a potential gap between represented reality and actual reality. This gap is determined by the fact that the information within the system is updated manually by expert designers, losing substantial synchronization with the real system under analysis. The risk is also to have a so extensive dataset to make its update management complex for a human user. Currently, to achieve direct interaction between civil structures and digital modeling systems, the scientific community is carrying out researches for the application of digital twin concepts in the field of construction automation. In particular, studies about the integration between IoT sensor networks and BIM start to be explored. The project described in this paper aims to propose such integration with a specific focus on air quality parameters monitoring, leveraging on scalable approaches. The data updating system is based on a distributed IoT sensor network, designed and implemented using free and open-source software; the communication protocols are all based on open broker-based technologies, like MQTT, and the data dashboard aimed to visualize real-time data and historical data series are based on web applications over HTTP.

The UK is widely regarded as having set the framework for standardisation in its push towards BIM Level 2 for rollout in 2016, with the result that many of its standards are being adopted internationally. One such standard is the classification system, Uniclass 2015, which is being adopted in Australia. Smart Cities does not have such a classification system.

Although quite a few theoretical unified data models of BIM and GIS integration have been presented in precedent research, the practical web-based applications and software support for real-world city information modeling are still difficult to achieve. One of the challenges is storage inefficiency. It thence leads to burdens in exchange and analysis, which hugely impede the realization of virtual-real fusion. To address that issue, in this research, we contribute to exploring an HDF- (Hierarchical Data Format-) based, innovative, and synthesized scheme with three significant technical processes. First, data reorganization trims the original data with efficient redundancy elimination and reordering for IFC-SPF (IFC STEP Physical File) and XML-encoded CityGML (City Geography Markup Language). Next, bidirectional transformation methods for BIM and GIS modeling data, images, and analytical data into HDF are proposed. They retain the entities and relationships in modeling data and can further improve the compactness and accessibility by ultimately 60%-80% which saves 497,612 KB from 565,152 KB in the test of ZhongChun transformation substation. Finally, data aggregation enhances the bond of the integrated model and heterogeneous data resources from the transformed HDF files. The case studies show that the approach proposed in this paper could reach high efficiency for practicability of the BIM + GIS integration model.

While the sectors are rapidly adapting themselves to the new era, firms that do not invest in innovation lose their value at a fast pace. When we look at the Fortune 500 list, it is seen that the biggest leap is made by companies in the IT sector. However, the situation is observed to be the opposite for construction companies. Despite the enormous investment costs and the huge risks involved, construction companies are unable to compete with the leaders of the digital world and falling down in the list. The losses of time and cost are increasing in the construction sector which lags behind in the digitizing world. The systematic analysis of these losses with analytical methods remains limited and there are problems in project management approaches. The industry today invests into digital transformation with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to deal with these problems in the construction sector and to produce a solution according to their dynamics in the digital world. BIM is the digital twin model of actual construction consisting of data-rich 3D objects. Accurate management of a data-rich model is possible with data management techniques.

In this regard, digitalization is disrupting the wind section thanks to the development of advanced sensors, automated equipment, computational power, among other. All these allow to optimize and simplify different parts of the offshore wind power plant development (i.e. design, planning, installation, O&M, etc.). This fact is of special interest on maintenance, since the early detection of failures or malfunctions lead to reduced costly corrective maintenance. This paper presents a literature review of current state-of-the-art on the application of digitalization activities which can be applied for floating wind, including typical component failures, monitoring techniques and advanced digital tools as Digital Twin concept and Building Information Models (BIM).

However, empirical evidence on such adoption is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities during the O&M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O&M phase using four geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM activities by providing real-time status of the building assets. However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O&M phase of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities during the O&M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM decision-making processes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123012263

DTs in buildings can be regarded as an expression of “BIM+,” born to digital descriptions. Comprehensive perception of physical systems is the preconditions for DTs implementation. BIM's energy-saving design includes the selection of building orientation and building shape. BIM energy consumption analysis can compare different materials, examine the performance of various materials, and select the most suitable and most energy-efficient materials for building structure maintenance. Data Fusion Algorithm (DFA) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is improved. A novel DFA is constructed by combining Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DCHP), recorded as BP-DCHP. Simulation experiment proves that BP-DCHP can prolong sensor nodes’ survival time and provide the highest data fusion quality. BP-DCHP runs for about 310 s, 500 s, and 705 s in WSNs consisting of 20, 50, and 100 WSNs, respectively. Moreover, BP-DCHP can provide higher quality given insufficient data fusion degree. Once the WSNs consume 50% of the total initial energy, BP-DCHP presents a shorter network delay, only 0.6 s on average in the 100-sensor-node-WSN. To validate BDTs’ effectiveness, the environmental satisfaction of residents from two Beijing intelligent communities is assessed using Deep Learning (DL) approach. Taking the data as the clue, the study establishes DTs serving the application of urban scene, which plays a certain role in promoting the technological innovation of BDTs, better optimizing the city and managing the city. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122466729

However, assessing the safety of an earthquake-damaged building requires considering this damage in the context of its global impact on the structural system. Thus, an inspection must consider the expected damage progression of the associated component and the component’s contribution to structural system performance. To address this issue, a digital twin framework is proposed for post-earthquake building evaluation that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, component identification, and damage evaluation using a Building Information Model (BIM) as a reference platform. The BIM guides selection of optimal sets of images for each building component. Then, if damage is identified, each image pixel is assigned to a specific BIM component, using a GrabCut-based segmentation method. In addition, 3D point cloud change detection is employed to identify nonstructural damage and associate that damage with specific BIM components. Two example applications are presented. The first develops a digital twin for an existing reinforced concrete moment frame building and demonstrates BIM-guided image selection and component identification. The second uses a synthetic graphics environment to demonstrate 3D point cloud change detection for identifying damaged nonstructural masonry walls. In both examples, observed damage is tied to BIM components, enabling damage to be considered in the context of each component’s known design and expected earthquake performance. The goal of this framework is to combine component-wise damage estimates with a pre-earthquake structural analysis of the building to predict a building’s post-earthquake safety based on an external UAV survey. © 2022 by the authors.

With other industries such as the automotive industry already achieving great success in the field of digitization with status-based maintenance intervals for cars or autonomous driving, the construction industry is now also experiencing a transformation. The digital twin plays a key role in predictive maintenance in particular. It enables all data and information on the asset to be gathered, structured and linked to a temporal and spatial context. In the digital twin, the basis for the localization of information is a 3-D model. The Building Information Modeling method provides the perfect basis for this in the construction industry, but can often only be applied to existing assets with a large amount of effort. Since the creation and modification of such models often must be carried out by experts and is usually a time-consuming process, and since the data structure does not allow for the management of mass data, it is necessary to carefully consider which data should be directly integrated into the 3-D model and in which areas the linked data approach makes more sense.

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122375604

The camera can be moved to explore the space by using, in VR, the mobile device’s gyroscope (to rotate) and a joystick (to move around) or by freely walking inside the building in AR. Its main purpose is to monitor the live status of the WWTP whether it is from a remote location using VR or inside the building using AR. In almost every equipment of the WWTP there is information from the computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) and sensors uploading measurements to a server feeding the SCADA.

Those are different in terms of use, content, and technical implementation, as nowadays a comprehensive definition does not exist. Most of the presented solutions are vendor and software dependent, and usually, they are offering a mere 3D graphical user interface (GUI) visualizing spaces and conditions. Although those can help a facility engineer monitor an asset’s performance, they are not real digital twins.

New model features can improve the ability of a machine learning model to classify a person's thermal preference. The spatial context of a building can provide information to models about the windows, walls, heating and cooling sources, air diffusers, and other factors that create micro-environments that influence thermal comfort. Due to spatial heterogeneity, it is impractical to position sensors at a high enough resolution to capture all conditions. This research aims to build upon an existing vector-based spatial model, called Build2Vec, for predicting spatial–temporal occupants’ indoor environmental preferences. Build2Vec utilizes the spatial data from the Building Information Model (BIM) and indoor localization in a real-world setting. This framework uses longitudinal intensive thermal comfort subjective feedback from smart watch-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The aggregation of these data is combined into a graph network structure (i.e., objects and relations) and used as input for a classification model to predict occupant thermal preference. The results of a test implementation show 14%–28% accuracy improvement over a set of baselines that use conventional thermal preference prediction input variables. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119963452

Thus, dating the state and the evolution of the elements requires a special treatment, including the application of both advanced numerical analysis and non-invasive data acquisition techniques. In the latter, making digital copies of geometries through 3D reconstruction models is of great interest to compare and analyse structural evolutionary data accurately. For this purpose, appropriate software with containers of information correlated to the parametric elements in a BIM environment should be used. However, it is imperative to advance from static to dynamic models to collect the structural transformations caused by both the pass of time and other factors. The methodology followed in this paper is based on the experimentation by creating digital twins. The portico of a courtyard in a historical building from the 18th century was used as test bed. Based on the bibliographical recommendations, the terrestrial laser scanner is applied as a technique to acquire accurate data. The point cloud is used as a referential auxiliary to survey the model in the BIM platform with the Revit software. To assess the quality of the model built and to analyse the structural deviations between the parametric model and the actual geometry, the Dynamo script is used. To validate the experimentation, structural deviations are measured using both the parametric model and the point cloud with CloudCompare, a software for data treatment. The results were very positive because the deviation between the data obtained by Dynamo© and CloudCompare in the most unfavourable construction unit was between 0.5 and 1.17 cm, so these techniques are highly appropriate to review visual records and to analyse structural deviations. This new approach presents a new gap in the 3D reconstruction to date and control architectural structures, particularly in historical buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118890998

This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework—namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)—that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects’ lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects’ lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works.

Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2) Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy, interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0 to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security, efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE). © 2021 by the authors.

Due to a lack of consensus on the system boundaries in building life cycle assessment (LCA), the carbon estimation results obtained by the current methods are often disputable. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for estimating building embodied carbon based on digital twin technology and LCA. The proposed method is advantageous over others by providing (1) a cradle-to-cradle LCA and (2) an automated data communication between LCA and building information modelling (BIM) databases. Because data for the processes in the life cycle are collected via digital twin technology in a standard and consistent way, the obtained results will be considered credible. So far, a conceptual framework is developed based on a comprehensive literature review, which consists of three parts. In the first part, formulas for LCA are given. In the second part, a hybrid approach combining semantic web with a relational database for BIM and radio-frequency identification (RFID) integration is described. In the third part, how to design the LCA database and how to link LCA with BIM are described.

How waste sorting could be properly planned in the early stages, not only for new construction, but also deconstruction projects is critical to minimizing C&D wastes. As there is a large amount of aging assets without digital files or even no drawings, developing a digital-driven approach to effectively estimate and categorize C&D wastes would be essential for, not just early-stage deconstruction planning, but also the development of a circular economy on C&D wastes.

In the case of traditional Korean wooden architectures, especially the bracket-sets of buildings, there is a limit to accuracy, owing to non-visible seams. Thus, in this study, mesh modelling is conducted using point-cloud data of the entire Seoikheon building of Jeonju Pungpajigwan, which is a national cultural property of Korea. After dismantling the building, scanning the members and cross-checking the cloud data, it was possible to create a realistic Rhino 3D model that includes joints of the bracket set.

Various research methodologies have been proposed to address uncertainties such as waiting and waste in construction projects, but they do not take into account the complexity of construction production systems. In this study, a research approach was proposed that simplified the construction production system into a work package to be serviced and a work group to provide services. In addition, a conceptual 4D digital twin framework considering the uncertainty of the construction production system was proposed. This framework includes BIM as an information model and a queuing model as a decision-making model. Through case projects, we have presented how this framework can be used for decision making in several statuses. As a result of the analysis using the performance index of the queuing model, it was possible to monitor the status of the system according to the allocation of resources. In addition, it was possible to confirm the improvement of the performance index according to the additional arrangement of the work group and the activity cycle of the work package. The framework presented in this study helps to quantitatively analyze the state of the system according to the input data based on empirical knowledge, but it has a limitation in that it cannot present an optimized resource allocation solution. Therefore, in future research, it is necessary to consider the grafting of machine learning technology that can provide optimal solutions by solving complex decision-making problems. © 2021 by the authors.

Our previous work achieved the current state-of-the-art class segmentation performance (75% average accuracy per point and average area under the ROC curve, AUC, 90% in the CLOI dataset classes) and directly produces labelled point clusters of the most important to model objects (CLOI classes) from laser scanned industrial data. CLOI stands for C-shapes, L-shapes, O-shapes, I-shapes and their combinations. However, the problem of automated segmentation of individual instances that can then be used to fit geometric shapes remains unsolved. We argue that the use of instance segmentation algorithms has the theoretical potential to provide the output needed for the generation of gDTs. We solve instance segmentation in this paper through (1) using a CLOI-Instance graph connectivity algorithm that segments the point clusters of an object class into instances, and (2) boundary segmentation of points that improves Step 1. Our method was tested on the CLOI benchmark dataset and segmented instances with 76.25% average precision and 70% average recall per point among all classes. This proved that it is the first to automatically segment industrial point cloud shapes with no prior knowledge other than the class point label and is the bedrock for efficient gDT generation in cluttered industrial point clouds. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113810929

BIM contains different types of data and information about a building including 3D (geometry), 4D (time), 5D (cost), 6D (facility management) and 7D (sustainability). Once constructed, this 'digital twin' of the building allows for adding new services and for stakeholders interacting with the building design through through sensors, immersive experiences and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. As a socio-technical software process, BIM also accommodates diverging agendas on design and construction for sustainability, and these diverging concepts about 'sustainability' ""live""in different places with implications for the resulting BIM models.

Considering the complexity of the occupational health and safety management, the decision-making processes and operational performance in this field requires special emphasis on communication, data gathering and feedback organization-wide. As technologies advanced and flexible enough, the BIM-based digital twinning provides an opportunity to give decision-making support in the scope of complex situations and comprehensive data management of construction projects. Through the real-time interfaces and the users´ information sharing BIM-based digital twinning is a big step in the direction of safety management based on predictive analysis, all users/workers inclusion and smart assets optimization and assessment of the decision-making processes at all operational levels.

Digital twins are the enablers for the creation of such ecosystems. Digital twins create the transparency in the virtual design, tests, implementation optimization of the products, processes or even entire production systems. The modern IoE (Internet of Everything) technology is able to cover a new dimension in terms of monitoring and controlling an operating state of a product, process or system. Digital twin as a virtual representation of the product, production or performance enables the seamless linkage of the individual process steps in the fiber production. This increases efficiency, minimizes the error rate, shortens development cycles and also opens up new business opportunities - that ensuring a sustainable increase the competitiveness in the fiber industry. Unfortunately, it is a very complex topic and has a high impact on internal and external processes. The technical challenges are spread in different domains. Most of fiber production companies currently use only single elements of the digital twins solution in some sub-areas - the overarching solution is missing. Many technical challenges come with the implementation of the architecture of digital twin. The architecture consists of physical devices, an optional device management system, a connectivity solution, a platform, and the actual application. The physical devices capture the data from the real twin (eg. melting furnace, bushings etc). It transports the information to the platform, or it will be stored temporarily in the device management. The device management has the task to control all devices. This is sometimes necessary when the devices are from different suppliers or the device itself is complex. Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays an important role for the planning, design, constructing, operating and maintaining of the new fiber production facilities. Besides a successful implementation of digital twins for the innovative basalt fiber production 4.0 this presentation provides a pragmatic approach to get access to the digital twin technology in the fiber industry. It covers the range from the conceptual understanding of a digital twin to a successful implementation. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123643817

This makes it harder for the software engineers usually lacking the knowledge of the industry context to elicit, analyze and structure the requirements and to effectively communicate with AECO professionals. To live up to that task, we present an approach and a tool for collecting AECO-specific software requirements with the aim to foster reuse and leverage domain knowledge.

The built buildings perform poorly in terms of energy usage and energy conservation. The study expects to explore the potential safety hazards of prefabricated buildings during the construction process. On this basis, a modelling study of the construction process is carried out. The study uses Digital Twins (DTs) technology and prefabricated Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conduct in-depth modelling research on the building construction process. The prefabricated building construction system oriented to DTs technology can well solve the problems of structural damage and deformation in the production, transportation, and assembly process of building components. Especially in prefabricated buildings, it can monitor and accurately predict the damage of building components that may occur in the entire system due to structural problems and material problems in real time. Regarding the building information model, the study uses third-party software to transfer the assembly information to the network cloud to further realize the display of the BIM. The study shows that the maximum value of the effective risk cases selected is 130, and its effective rate is 100%; after processing the data, it is found that the initial value is always stable, and its value is 1; the extracted value is always changing, the maximum value is 0.86, and the minimum is 0.75. By this result, the conclusion is that DTs technology and BIM can effectively monitor the indicators of risk problems during the construction of prefabricated buildings and can further reduce potential safety hazards.

BIM, DIN 1076, SIB structures, monitoring etc., each of which works with different data formats. For an intelligent maintenance management, however, all data with the different data formats must be merged, stored, and managed in such a way that the mapping of a holistic digital twin of a structure is possible over the entire life cycle of a bridge.

For bridges this control is carried out by qualified engineers in regular inspections. The analysis of the condition and its expected development is mainly determined by cyclic measurements detected with human senses. In other industries (e. g. aviation, power plants) full automated monitoring and evaluation of the condition using digital sensors is already common. This allows a real-time monitoring and a predictive maintenance. This digital transformation has not been transferred into civil engineering. This can be explained with the individuality, the dimensions, the long live-time and the relatively small rate of change of the most important vital parameters of bridge structures. But the transition to a digital maintenance of our infrastructure is essential to be able to evaluate our existing structures, to detect the initiation or the progress of degradation processes and to shift from a reactive to a predictive maintenance. A strategy to achieve this goal is the realisation of a digital bridge twin. Based on a three-dimensional BIM model of the geometry the condition is detected and determined by a combination of cyclic results from bridge inspections and other diagnostic evaluations supplemented by real-time monitoring data.

We experiment with a parametric approach towards estimating the shape and growth of trees in a BIM environment with different levels of LoD (Level of Detail). The selected envelope model allows for a description of a wide range of crown forms, including asym-metric forms for existing trees and symmetric forms for planned trees. It also includes the growth function with specific parameters for overall height, height of clear stem, largest crown diameter, height of largest crown diameter, length, and depth of root, and helps calculate the shapes and volumes in time (age), while describing the morphological traits of a tree specific to its inherent species characteristics. Apart from the geometry of the model, we define the information required in each design stage and lifecycle phase as a consistent parameter set based on our proposed modelling approach, attempt to standardize for landscape BIM elements. The proposed envelope model, function, and parameter sets are shown to be effective. We implemented a set of Revit families, including generic models, and a list of species used for teaching in higher edu-cation in Switzerland. We successfully performed clash detection, connected to assets for real time visualization, and validated the proposed parameter set by demonstrating the use of the model during the construction phase and handover of the Digital Twin to GIS. The parametric tree object is an important element in the development of BIM for landscape architects and contractors. It ensures that designers, contractors, suppliers, and clients can use the same object across the entire life cycle for the project. Parametric trees will create a better link between the BIM model and the building environment, and give us the possibility to create intelligent facility management models, also known as digital twin. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110570335

As BIM works on the building or infrastructure scale, CIM works on the city scale simulating a lot of urban data sets. Digitizing the whole city, we can have a digital twin or rather an advanced 3D model containing the most varied information about our cities useful for their management. How can the adoption of CIM help urban planning and urban design? Thanks to the digital twin of the city, administrations can have an innovative tool for territorial governance. Local planners can simulate new urban visions, prefigure, verify, and control physical transformation of our city or evaluate city resilience to natural phenomena, thus making more informed design decisions.

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

However, there have been challenges in quantifying improvements from the conventional method, which leads to the low uptake. The concept of a digital twin (DT) is useful for OSM, which enables production to be represented virtually and visually including all activities associated with it, resources, and workflow involved. Thus, essential information in the product development process such as cost, time, waste, and environmental impacts can be assessed. However, the data required to have accurate results and better-informed decision-making come from heterogeneous data formats (i.e. spreadsheets and BIM models) and across different domains. The inclusion of semantic web technologies such as Linked Data (LD) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) models has proven to better address these challenges especially in terms of interoperability and unambiguous knowledge systematisation. Through an extensive systematic literature review followed up by a case study, an ontology knowledge structure representing the production workflow for OSM is developed. A real-life use case of a semi-automated production line of wall panel production is used to test and demonstrate the benefits of the semantic digital twin in obtaining cost and time data of the manufacturing for assessment. Results demonstrated the potential capability and power of capturing knowledge for an ontology to assess production workflow in terms of cost, time, carbon footprint thereby enabling more informed decision making for continuous improvements.

From the studies in this field have resulted in new calculation methods and energy and characteristics physical environment assessment. Energy research developed in parallel with distributed computational capabilities and the software that allowed them to automate not only the calculations but also parametric simulations. A chronological summary of this evolution is illustrated with references to the main modeling and energy simulation software. Some experimental projects developed over the last 20 years are presented, demonstrating the state of the art of Green Design with evidence relating to the actual performance in use conditions. In advanced areas such as the development of tertiary buildings and terminals, the three areas of sustainability are combined to obtain more sustainable projects not only on an environmental basis but also on economic and social ones. The phenomena are driven by market and management needs; it is evidenced by the increase in standards and life cycle certifications aimed not only at products but also at the overall management of the project and activities over the life cycle. With the evolution of CAD towards BIM platforms since the second half of the 1950s, the possibility of creating interoperable platforms useful for various purposes has opened up: in a first phase, it was possible to import data processed by specialized software and subsequently to integrate them into the field of modeling. With the perspectives opened by platforms on the web, a new way of designing and producing is started, fully compatible with the digital environment.

Considering, for instance, Offsite Construction, it is clearer how such concept could be realized. Current widespread adoption of BIM helps but is not enough to realize that end, because it is, in general, limited to information being manually created through authoring software, and consumed for different proposes, such as Clash Detection, or 4D Modeling. Construction 4.0 should transcend the limitations of existing only in cyberspace; it should interact directly with the real environment by means of sensors (gathering data), and remote controlled or autonomous machines, employed as part of the production processes, with Machine Learning algorithms handling the transformation of data into information, and actions. The central element of such approach should be a Digital Twin-driven Cyber-Physical System, which when focused on Construction Phase, would be capable to simulate the dynamics of construction processes. In this position article, an evolution of the concept of Computer-Integrated Construction (CIC) is presented as a possibility in representing and guiding developments associated to the incorporation of different technologies from Industry 4.0 to Construction. A framework where such a system could be applied to Off-site or Automated Construction scenario, and to Traditional Construction scenario as well is proposed.

This is notably observed in geometry reconstruction (e.g., scan-to-BIM, reverse engineering, etc.), where a tradeoff often occurs between computational efficiency and the choice between increased semantic enrichment or increased representational accuracy (often both cannot be achieved simultaneously). This dichotomy can be generalized as a choice or tradeoff between parametric and non-parametric object representation forms. This paper presents a simple conceptual model for characterizing the datatypes used for representing and defining construction geometry to understand key tradeoffs that exist. First, we survey existing literature across multiple domains to identify and distill key attributes used in characterization according to the terms parametric and non-parametric. Then, we develop and illustrate a conceptual model using an analogy to mathematical expressions vs. discrete digital approximations employed in computer vision (e.g., Gaussian kernel, Hough Transform, and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm).

In such a scenario, virtual avatars randomly explore the construction site in order to detect accessible, unprotected and risky workspaces at height, while warning the safety inspector in case additional safety measures are needed. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

In addition to being a digital representation of a physical asset, system or process, a digital twin should represent the nuances such as the hierarchy nature of physical assets, relationships between different systems and the workflow of different processes. Furthermore, a digital twin should be agnostic to specific technology solutions and aim to have the ability to support data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data standardisation, integration and exchange. This paper presents a BIM-based approach for the design and development of a digital twin. This approach utilises the object-orientated aspect of a BIM model for the creation of an Asset Information Model (AIM), which supports the creation of a DT.

The load pattern makes the structure very interesting for detailed investigation. The focus of the monitoring lies on the bolted joints of the flange connections that are a typical connection for cylindrical elements if welding is technical or economical unfavorable. The definition of the monitoring takes was done by investigating the existing documents and inspection results accompanied by building an initial digital representation of the structure, consisting of two finite element (FE) models and a geometrical 3D point cloud representation. As a first step the structures behavior during static and dynamic loading was analyzed using measurement data and an updated numerical FE Model.

The digital twin concept could provide the solution; however, the creation of appropriate input data has been the main roadblock in adoption and application. The information needs for creation of digital twins of existing buildings are vast and as such none of the existing research approaches and/or algorithms are capable of holistic data collection to be used as input. A prevailing method for gathering geometrical data of existing assets is laser scanning, where a point cloud with high precision and high data volume is produced. The detection of geometrical and/or semantic information from the point cloud data has been recently a goal of many research initiatives; however they were usually focused on single purpose data extraction, thus limiting wider application.

To address this, owners have historically tried to transfer risks to contractors through combative contracts. However, with few mechanisms in place for finding or capturing early upside opportunities, this approach appears to exacerbate losses to owners. Excessive contingency allocations, reduced scope, low-quality work, missed schedule and cost targets and stressed contractors have become normal. New thinking to resolve the Megaproject Paradox, is looking to risk management culture as well as the ability of existing organisational structures to effectively capitalise on the promise of Digital Engineering. Critical to this is effectively answering the “where, what and how” questions during the Initiation and Planning phases of a project. Significant opportunities for economic and environmental savings are bound in the justification of “where and what” to build in the context of the geological setting, which underpins “how” to build. For example, ensuring foundations are tailored to the geology or minimising rock dredging will save a significant percentage of the overall project budget and, define appropriate construction strategies. However, due to the lack of high-quality digital data for geological modelling, Digital Engineering and Building Information Modelling (BIM) currently does not attempt to answer “where and what”, or does so poorly. Geology is generally left to the contractor to manage as “known unknowns” and owners guess at alignments and design. Low resolution and single parameter legacy geophysical and geotechnical techniques are inadequate and do not provide the digital data, or the level of detail required to realise the potential of Digital Engineering. Ground modelling based on real world data must become a tenant of early project definition. Owners cannot afford to continue to guess at where to put infrastructure or how to build and, stakeholders must not allow it. © Australasian Coasts and Ports 2019 Conference.

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in points clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to detected point clusters remains human dependent to a great extent. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them to right locations. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are made up of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of existing methods have evaluated the resulting models in terms of spatial accuracy with quantitative measurements. We tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from labelled point clusters. The accuracy of the generated models is gauged using distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point clouds indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance smaller than that of the manual one (7.05 cm vs. 7.69 cm) (value included all challenging cases), and an average twinning time of 37.8 seconds. Compared to the laborious manual practice, this is much faster to twin bridge concrete elements. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

Even if the data is already in a digitized and vectorised format, the lack of semantics often prevents the data from being processed in automated workflows. However, the requirements for simulation tasks, which are relevant for brown-field projects, are not too demanding regarding the level of detail. In most cases (e.g. optimized placement of fire safety equipment, evacuation planning, daylighting simulation etc.), only information about spaces and their interconnections are needed. If coefficients for the heat-transfer between spaces can be added, also energy simulations can be performed. Therefore the goal of this work is to provide a basic standardized building model, which can be derived from all sorts of legacy data (different CAD formats and styles and even scanned plans). Also basic semantics will be added to the data, which complements the definitions of the BIM standard used in this work. Based on the models, building simulation can be enabled as a cheap surplus service, promoting the usage of cloud implementation of the BIM process.
