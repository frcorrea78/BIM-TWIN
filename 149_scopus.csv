The hierarchy referred to variously as the 'Knowledge Hierarchy', the 'Information Hierarchy' and the 'Knowledge Pyramid' is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and 'taken-for-granted' models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff's original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts. © CILIP.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947173628

This ongoing discussion about problems, such as low profitability and high construction costs, results in demands for higher value, cost savings, better quality, and longer guarantees in construction. However, construction is not manufacturing, but it does provide elements that can be exploited to improve processes and reduce waste. Moving towards better quality and more homogenous construction can be achieved by standardized processes and by using standardized products in those processes. Thus, this study aims to analyze what the major challenges for the standardization of processes and products in the construction industry are and how the challenges can be beaten. The results indicate that the challenges of standardizing the processes are that the importance of accurate planning and front-end activities are not completely understood and the projects are still considered as unique entities. Additionally, the standardization of products has the following challenges: construction projects and solutions are still perceived as unique handwork, designers do not understand the benefits of standardized products, and planning processes do not support using standardized products.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923373651

The underlying reason is that it requires consideration of several temporal aspects, which involve various time stamps. Also, transactional systems, which serves as a data source for data warehouse, have the tendency to change themselves due to changing business requirements. The classical dimensional model is deficient in handling changes to transaction sources. This has led to the development of various schemes, including evolution of data and evolution of data model and versioning of dimensional model. These models have their own strengths and limitations, but none fully satisfies the above-stated broad range of aspects, making it difficult to compare the proposed schemes with one another. This paper analyses the schemes that satisfy such challenging aspects faced by a data warehouse and proposes taxonomy for characterizing the existing models to temporal data management in data warehouse. The paper also discusses some open challenges. © 2017 Sidra Faisal et al.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042722133
