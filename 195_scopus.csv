One way to develop an understanding of PLM’s characteristic and boundaries is to propose models that help us conceptualise both holistic and component views in compact packages. Models can give us both a rich way of thinking about overall concepts and can identify areas where we need to explore issues that such models raise. In this paper, the author proposes and discusses two such related models, the Product Lifecycle Management Model (PLM Model) and the Mirrored Spaces Model (MSM) and investigates the conceptual and technical issues raised by these models. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047222275
