We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision. © 2011 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84055199652

The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed 'Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870300327

Graphical rendering technology is combined with constrained active contour tracking to create a robust wire-frame tracking system. It operates in real time at video frame rate (25 Hz) on standard hardware. It is based on an internal CAD model of the object to be tracked which is rendered using a binary space partition tree to perform hidden line removal. The visible edge features are thus identified online at each frame and correspondences are found in the video feed. A Lie group formalism is used to cast the motion computation problem into simple geometric terms so that tracking becomes a simple optimization problem solved by means of iterative reweighted least squares. A visual servoing system constructed using this framework is presented together with results showing the accuracy of the tracker. The system also incorporates real-time online calibration of internal camera parameters. The paper then describes how this tracking system has been extended to provide a general framework for tracking in complex configurations, including the use of multiple cameras, the tracking of structures with articulated components, or of multiple structures with constraints. The methodology used to achieve this exploits the simple geometric nature of the Lie group formalism which renders the constraints linear and homogeneous.

Conventional crack detection methods are performed by experienced human inspectors who sketch crack patterns manually; however, such detection methods are expensive and subjective. Therefore, automated crack detection techniques that utilize image processing have been proposed. Although most the image-based approaches focus on the accuracy of crack detection, the computation time is also important for practical applications because the size of digital images has increased up to 10 megapixels. We introduce an efficient and high-speed crack detection method that employs percolation-based image processing. We propose termination-and skip-added procedures to reduce the computation time. The percolation process is terminated by calculating the circularity during the processing. Moreover, percolation processing can be skipped in subsequent pixels according to the circularity of neighboring pixels.

While SIFT is known to be a strong, but computationally expensive feature descriptor, Ferns classification is fast, but requires large amounts of memory. This renders both original designs unsuitable for mobile phones. We give detailed descriptions on how we modified both approaches to make them suitable for mobile phones.

This paper particularly considers the case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find, recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds automatically. Previous research has also shown that ""Scan-vs-BIM"" systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works, thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking, automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and identification metric. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We start with a feature-point based tracker we developed in earlier work and integrate the ability to take edge-information into account. Achieving optimal performance in the presence of cluttered or textured backgrounds, however, is far from trivial because of the many spurious edges that bedevil typical edge-detectors. We overcome this difficulty by proposing a method for handling multiple hypotheses for potential edge-locations that is similar in speed to approaches that consider only single hypotheses and therefore much faster than conventional multiple-hypothesis ones.

In order to address these issues a real-time, robust and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a 'video see through' monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, non-linear pose computation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curve interaction matrices is given for different features including lines, circles, cylinders and spheres. A local moving edge tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. A method is proposed for combining local position uncertainty and global pose uncertainty in an efficient and accurate way by propagating uncertainty. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively re-weighted least squares implementation.

Starting with a point cloud of a scene - generated using laser scanners or image-based reconstruction methods - the user must first identify collections of points that belong to individual surfaces, and then, fit surfaces and solid geometry objects appropriate for the analysis. When performed manually, this task is often prohibitively time consuming and, in response, several research groups have recently focused on developing methods for automating the modeling process. Due to the limitations of the data collection processes as well as the complexity of as-built scenes, automated 3D modeling still presents many challenges. To overcome existing limitations, in this paper, we propose a new region growing method for robust context-free segmentation of unordered point clouds based on geometrical continuities. In our method, the user sets a single parameter which accounts for the desired level of abstraction. We treat this parameter as a locally adaptive threshold to account for local context. Our method of segmentation starts with a multi-scale feature detection, describing surface roughness and curvature around each 3D point, and is followed by seed finding and region growing steps.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches.

As a consequence, inspections are often omitted, resulting in faulty construction and quality degradation which may necessitate rework. This may adversely affect project costs and schedule. This paper addresses these issues by utilizing BIM, image-matching, and augmented reality (AR) to develop two types of defect management systems including: 1) an image-matching system to enable quality inspection without visiting the real work site; and 2) a mobile DM-AR app which enables workers and managers to automatically detect dimension errors and omissions on the jobsite.

To achieve the goal, this study introduces a new 'disassembly sequence structure graph' (DSSG) model for multiple-target selective disassembly sequence planning, an approach for creating DSSGs, and methods for searching DSSGs. The DSSG model contains a minimum set of parts that must be removed to remove selected targets, with an order and direction for removing each part. The approach uses expert rules to choose parts, part order, and part disassembly directions, based upon physical constraints. The searching methods use rules to remove all parts, in order, from the DSSG. The DSSG approach is an optimal approach. The approach creates a high quality minimum-size model, in minimum time. The approach finds high quality, practical, realistic, physically feasible solutions, in minimum time. The solutions are optimized for number of removed parts, part order, part disassembly directions, and reorientations. The solutions remove parts in practical order.

Achieving net benefits with adaptive reuse partly relies on efficiently planning building disassembly. The aim of this paper is to describe a new efficient single-target selective disassembly sequence planning method developed for adaptive reuse of buildings. Finding a global optimum disassembly planning solution for buildings can be time consuming and physically impractical due to the high number of possible solutions. The method developed seeks to minimize environmental impact and removal costs using rule-based recursive analyses for planning recovery of target components from multi-instance building subsystems based upon physical, environmental and economic constraints. Rule-based recursive methods have been demonstrated to be an efficient alternative to find near-optimal disassembly sequences by eliminating uncommon or unrealistic solutions. Validation is achieved through functional demonstration with case studies, where high quality, practical, realistic, and physically feasible solutions for single-target selective disassembly of buildings are found by using the new method. For adaptive reuse of buildings, the new method can be used to reduce the costs of disassembly and demolition and improve the planning process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043587963

A wearable device, therefore, has been developed that can project the construction drawings and related information on the basis of the needs of the users. This device is envisaged to help engineers avoid carrying bulky construction drawings to the site, and to reduce the effort required in looking for the correct drawings to obtain the information they need. This device includes four modules: the information-integration module, the display module, the positioning module, and the manipulation module. The information-integration module is used to transfer information in the building information model (BIM) into images to enable the on-site retrieval from the device that was developed. The position module enables users to input their locations and automatically search for the images that the users might need. The manipulation module can analyze the gestures of the users from the touch screen and accelerometer in the devices, and then crop the images to eliminate the unneeded information. The display module, which directly links to the projector, can continually calculate the images processed by the previous three modules and scale the images accordingly, ensuring that the projection results in a correct scale. A hardware device, coined the iHelmet, has also been developed to implement the four modules. It consists of a construction helmet (weight: 460g), an iPod Touch (weight: 115g), and an Optoma light-emitting diode (LED) projector (weight: 114g). To validate the usability of the iHelmet on-site, a user test with 34 participants was conducted. A comparison of the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieving building information using the iHelmet was done using the traditional two-dimensional (2D) drawing approach. The results showed that the mean completion times were significantly shorter for participants using the iHelmet (iHelmet: 44s; traditional approach: 99s). The mean success rates of participants arriving at the correct answers were also significantly improved for those using the iHelmet (iHelmet: 91.6%; traditional approach: 64.3%). © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861145569

Permanent deflections may also occur during shipment and transportation. After delivery at construction sites, defective spools must be detected and further consideration given to the erection of the spools to tolerance levels specified; otherwise, the repair and realignment associated with rework can cause schedule delays and consequent substantial costs increases. This paper presents an automated approach for monitoring and assessing fabricated pipe spools using automated scan-to-BIM registration. Defects are detected through a neighborhood-based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach for the registration process. While this technique can be broadly employed, this paper focuses on industrial construction facilities with particular emphasis on pipe spool assemblies. Experiments show that the proposed approach can be employed for the automatic and continual monitoring of such assemblies throughout fabrication, assembly and erection to enable timely detection and characterization of deviations.

This constant change presents challenges for safety managers who must be able to foresee, as much as possible, hazardous conditions before they cause injuries or fatalities on the jobsite. Advances in information and sensing technology show promise in protecting workers from harm. However, they rely on data collection methods, which may not be fast enough to allow managers to act on the information they receive. This paper evaluates the potential applications that unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have for enhancing safety on construction jobsites by providing real-time visual access to jobsite environments. The type of UAS considered in this study is a quadcopter-type system that can be piloted remotely using a smart phone, tablet device, or computer. The evaluation of the system consisted of a heuristic evaluation, as well as a user participation analysis, to determine the features of an ideal UAS for safety-related tasks on construction sites. The results of the heuristic evaluation revealed some of the user interface challenges of the UAS interface considering safety related tasks. The user participation evaluation involved a simulated task in the controlled environment of the lab of determining worker compliance with the use of required personal protective equipment. This experimental approach revealed that using the UAS with a large-size interface on a tablet device would provide an accurate view of a jobsite that would be useful for safety-related tasks. Recommendations for the required features of an ideal UAS for construction safety applications include autonomous navigation, vocal interaction, high-resolution cameras, and collaborative user-interface environment, among others. The ultimate goal of this effort is to have jobsites free of the hazards that affect the most precious resource of the construction industry, its workers. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904643298

Instead, we use global image statistics to drive the pose estimation process. This confers a satisfying level of robustness to noise and initialization for our algorithm, and bypasses the need to establish correspondences between image and object features.

The authors implemented this research by using the Personal Dead Reckoning positioning system to serve as the inertial navigation based positioning system. The primary contribution of the presented work is the development and implementation of the Integrated Tracking System algorithm which was implemented in two levels. At the first level, the Integrated Tracking System (ITS) was developed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to ubiquitously track a mobile user, in dynamic environments where GPS coverage may be uncertain. At the second level, the PDR system was integrated with a database of pre-determined known indoor location points in order to correct the accumulated drift error during a mobile user's navigation in an indoor environment. Finally, a hybrid tracking system was developed and implemented by integrating the PDR system with the mobile user's intervention and discernment of the environment. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments performed on the aforementioned hybrid tracking systems demonstrate the potential of using hybrid tracking for determining the spatial context of mobile users in ubiquitous context-aware engineering applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Time used in conducting the evaluations substantially affects the duration for which the potentially damaged buildings remain unusable. The elapsed time may lead to direct economic losses to both public and private owners, and society at large. The presented research investigates the application of close-range photogrammetry surveying techniques and Augmented Reality (AR) visualization to design a semi-automated method for rapidly measuring structural damage induced in tall buildings by seismic events such as earthquakes or explosions. Close-range photogrammetry algorithms were designed to extract spatial information from photographic image data, and geometrically measure the horizontal drift (also called interstory drift) sustained at key floors along the edge of a damaged building. The measured drift can then be used to compute damage indices that correlate the drift to the building's structural integrity and safety. In this research, the measurement accuracy of the calculated drift using photogrammetry principles is particularly studied. The experimental results achieved an acceptable and usable accuracy level of 5 mm using a consumer grade digital SLR camera, demonstrating the potential of photogrammetry assisted rapid measurement of earthquake-induced building damage. It is expected that in the future, as advances in opticalsensing and positioning technologies continue to make highend cameras and measurement systems (GPS, compass) more affordable, higher accuracy will be practically achievable for further improvement in measurements using the proposed method. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053383536

Despite the fact that the precision of manufacturing machines is continually improving, there are inevitable discrepancies between the designed and built assemblies because of construction realities. Such non-compliant assemblies should be detected early, and the required corrective actions should be planned accordingly. This paper presents an algorithm for automated quantification of discrepancies for components of assemblies. Rather than using dense point clouds, the geometric skeleton (wireframe) of assemblies is extracted for further manipulation, once the as-built status is captured using the appropriate method. The extracted skeletons, which abstractly represent the designed and built states, are registered using a constrained iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. In order to identify the points making up each straight segment, the skeletons are clustered, and a straight line is fit to each resulting cluster. The corresponding segments in both states are then compared and investigated for quantifying the incurred discrepancy in the form of a rigid transformation.

Response to such events involves a large number of organizations that had no past interactions with each other but are required to collaborate during disaster relief efforts. Participants from diverse teams need to form an integrated first response group to effectively react to extreme situations. Civil engineers are expected to play a key role in collaborative first response groups, because of their structural expertise, as complex disasters in urban areas are usually followed by structural damage of critical physical infrastructure. The establishment of trust is a major challenge in extreme situations that involve diverse response teams. Although the means of communication are available (e.g., ad-hoc networks), first responders are hesitant to interact with others outside of their organization because of no prior experience of interactions with them. Moreover, the spread of inaccurate information in cases of complex disaster relief operations increases uncertainty and risk. Participants must be given the ability to assess the trustworthiness of others and information propagated by them in order to enforce collaboration. In this paper, we propose a decentralized trust model to reduce uncertainty and support reliable information dissemination in complex disaster relief scenarios. Our model includes a distributed recommendation scheme, incorporated into an existing membership maintenance service for ad-hoc networks, and a nature-inspired activation spreading mechanism that allows trust-based information propagation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in reducing information unreliability in complex disaster areas, we tested it through software simulations and by conducting a search and rescue exercise involving civil engineers and firefighters.

Augmented Reality (AR) technology, a seamless interface between the real and virtual world, has been developed to enhance assembly design and planning by improving the interaction between user and product. To improve the usability of the state-of-the-art AR assembly systems in routine and ad hoc assembly activities, the natural interactive mechanisms between assembly operator, assembly components, and computer-generated contents being rendered are imperative. Specifically, both physical and virtual components should be incorporated into the AR assembly environment to interact with each other, in order to provide an immersive experience, such that the user can see the results of interaction in realtime. In this paper, an Integrated Augmented-Reality-assisted Assembly Environment (IARAE) is proposed to facilitate assembly simulation and planning. To enable physical-virtual interaction, a new method is proposed to model the contact process based on the reasoning function of assembly ontology. A prototype system has been established, and a case study of an automobile alternator assembly is presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed system.

A computerized comprehensive method of quantity surveying aimed at reducing work invested in this stage has been developed. The method is based on geometric representation of the structure elements of a building (columns, beams, slabs and walls) in a three-dimensional co-ordinate system. This enables the intersections and contact areas between elements to be defined by the computer program. Consequently, the dimensions take-off, to be carried out by the quantity surveyor, is significantly reduced and simplified. The method has been developed for quantity surveying of buildings with rectangular structure elements whose edges are parallel to the axes of the co-ordinate system. The general approach of this method may, however, be extended to other kinds of buildings. The approach is likely to be of value in the development of computer graphic systems. © 1983, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959976160

The study focuses on deployment settings to provide data acquisition with higher accuracy for indoor location sensing. It provides extension to the state-of-the-art in this field as it addresses the impact of metal media proximity to RFID tags, the reasonable duration for data capturing, number of RFID tags employed and the distance between them. Low cost passive RFID tags were used in the experiments where each tag is used as a reference point with a known location. Five hundred and forty (514) experiments were conducted in lab environment using a 3m by 3m test bed that is dynamically rearranged to generate 15 test beds and a total of 67713 data sets were collected and analyzed. The collected data were captured from nine locations for each test bed at four time intervals. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) was used as the main attribute for signal measurement to process the captured data. Results of the data analysis performed are studied under four main categories: duration, number of tags, locations of tags and metal interference. The best duration was found to be the 15 second in the test bed with the least number of tags; as the short amount of time to capture data did not allow creation of a lot of interference among the emitted signals. Within each test bed, errors occurred most at points where the received signals were not well distributed in a 360 degree vicinity of the data capturing point. It means that the center point of each test bed resulted in lowest errors and the points located on the extremities led to the highest errors. Finally, metal objects were found to have major impact on the accuracy of the captured data; to the level where reliable values for errors could not be calculated in the test beds attached to metal objects. In summary, the results of the experimental study and related findings are expected to provide guidelines to the users of RFID technology for localization in building construction.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893555281

Method: By studying two classic types of natural marker-based registration algorithms, homography-from-detection and homography-from-tracking, and overcoming their specific limitations of jitter and drift, our method applies two global constraints (geometric and appearance) to prevent tracking errors from propagating between consecutive frames. Results & Discussion: The proposed method is able to achieve an increase in both stability and accuracy, while being fast enough for real-time applications. Experiments on both synthesized and real world test cases demonstrate that our method is superior to existing state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

The encountered well-known problem in monitoring is that the quality of the collected data is often subjected to great variation due to the variation in the reporting skills as well as the willingness to record data accurately. A potential technique to circumvent this problem is to conduct the comparison against multiple possible outcomes rather than a single-valued benchmark. The main objective of this research is to utilize the Pattern Recognition (PR) techniques to classify the work planned at specified cut-off dates during the planning stage and use the classification to monitor and evaluate the progress during the construction stage. The PR technique generalizes a virtual benchmark to represent the whole project based on multiple possible outcomes generated at a given cut-off date. The generalization feature offers a potential tool to overcome the problem of variation in the quality of data collected. Patterns are constructed to encode work of the project at different cut-off dates. Finally, the PR concept and technique proved its robustness to monitor and evaluate progress of constructionprojects based on the technique of Critical Path Method (CPM).

Building information models (BIM) contain detailed information about the as-designed state, particularly 3D drawings of construction components. On the other hand, using automated and accurate data acquisition methods such as laser scanning provide reliable and robust information about the as-built status of construction components. Registration therefore makes it possible to automatically compare the designed and built states in order to appropriately plan forward and generate the corrective actions required. This paper presents a new approach for reliably performing the registration with a required level of accuracy and automation within a substantially improved timeframe. Rather than performing the computationally intensive registration methods that may not work robustly for dense point clouds, the proposed framework employs the geometric skeleton of the construction components, which is extremely less dense and therefore computationally less costly for the processing step required. The method is experimentally tested for the components extruded along an axis, such as industrial assemblies (i.e. pipe spools and structural frames) for which a geometric skeleton represents the components abstractly. The registration of 3D point clouds is performed in a computationally less intensive manner, and the framework developed has the potential to be employed for (near) real-time assembly control, quality control and status assessment processes. © 2015 ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936882051

This paper presents the applications of a cubic marker in 3D models visualization and interaction and overcomes the above challenges. A cube having six fiducial markers, each on its face is used to be tracked from a single camera. The corners of the cubic marker are used to find its center. A 3D model is visualized on the center point of the real cubic maker. This cubic marker produces robust tracking results during occlusion. The visualization of 3D virtual models and interaction with these models are more realistic and ergonomic using the cubic marker. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918508386

In most conventional model-based marker-less AR frameworks, correspondences between the 3D model and the 2D frame for camera-pose estimation are obtained by feature-point matching. However, 3D models of the target scene are not always available, and feature points are not detected from texture-less objects. The authors' framework is based on a model-generation method with an RGB-D camera and model-based tracking using line segments, which can be detected even with only a few feature points. The camera pose of the input images can be estimated from the 2D-3D line-segment correspondences given by a line-segment feature descriptor. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve AR when other point-based frameworks cannot. The authors also argue that their framework can generate a model and estimate camera pose more accurately than their previous study. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041693443
