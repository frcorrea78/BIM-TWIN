It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points. © 1979 Optical Society of America.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975553202

This survey is motivated in part by recent developments in space-time registration, where one seeks a correspondence between non-rigid and time-varying surfaces, and semantic shape analysis, which underlines a recent trend to incorporate shape understanding into the analysis pipeline. Establishing a meaningful correspondence between shapes is often difficult because it generally requires an understanding of the structure of the shapes at both the local and global levels, and sometimes the functionality of the shape parts as well. Despite its inherent complexity, shape correspondence is a recurrent problem and an essential component of numerous geometry processing applications. In this survey, we discuss the different forms of the correspondence problem and review the main solution methods, aided by several classification criteria arising from the problem definition.

In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications.

The scope and performance potential of sensors in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal sensing abilities have expanded far beyond the traditional boundaries of remote sensing, resulting in significantly better observation capabilities. First, platform developments are reviewed with the main focus on emerging new remote sensing satellite constellations and UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) platforms. Next, sensor georeferencing and supporting navigation infrastructure, an enabling technology for remote sensing, are discussed. Finally, we group sensors based on their spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics, and classify them by their platform deployment competencies.

However, since GIS and BIM were originally developed for different purposes, numerous challenges are being encountered for the integration. To better understand these two different domains, this paper reviews the development and dissimilarities of GIS and BIM, the existing integration methods, and investigates their potential in various applications. This study shows that the integration methods are developed for various reasons and aim to solve different problems. The parameters influencing the choice can be summarized and named as ""EEEF"" criteria: effectiveness, extensibility, effort, and flexibility.

A key example of such models is Building Information Models (BIMs) which contain detailed geometric and semantic information about buildings. In fact, the BIMs' structure is very complex for facilitating navigation. This paper presents a new BIM Oriented Modeling methodology resulting in the definition of a new BIM based model (BO-IDM) dedicated for facilitating indoor navigation.

This approach involves a 3D modeling stage and the integration of the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further management and analysis. The modeling stage is carried out using a new concept; Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) which has been developed at the Dublin Institute of Technology [12]. Historic Building Information Modeling is a system for modeling historic structures from laser scan and photogrammetric data using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded scripting language within the BIM software called Geometric Descriptive Language (GDL). These objects are combined and mapped onto the survey data to build the entire model. After the 3D model has been created the next stage involves integrating the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further analysis. The international framework for 3D city modeling, CityGML has been adopted for this purpose. CityGML provides an interoperable framework for modeling 3D geometries, semantics, topology and appearance properties [13]. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between parametric CAD modeling and 3D GIS while using benefits from both systems to help document and analyze cultural heritage sites. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872036464

Contrary to outdoor environments, first responders and planners have limited information regarding the indoor areas in terms of architectural and semantic information as well as how they interact with their surroundings in case of indoor disasters. Availability of such information could help decision makers interact with building information and thus make more efficient planning prior to entering the disaster site. In addition as the indoor travel times required to reach specific areas in the building could be much longer compared to outdoor, visualizing the exact location of building rooms and utilities in 3D helps in visually communicating the indoor spatial information which could eventually result in decreased routing uncertainty inside the structures and help in more informed navigation strategies. This work aims at overcoming the insufficiencies of existing indoor modelling approaches by proposing a new Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) based on IFC. The model integrates 3D indoor architectural and semantic information required by first responders during indoor disasters with outdoor geographical information to improve situational awareness about both interiors of buildings as well as their interactions with outdoor components.

Tools based on BIM and Location Based Services (LBSs) have been developed to estimate energy consumption for material transportation and the surrounding density of the sites. However, the tools are not programmable and limited by their serving phases. This requires solutions that have the flexibility to run site analysis on social surroundings and the compatibility of user programming in the early design stage. Integrating visual programming and web service Application Programming Interface (API) can fulfill the requirements of evaluating publicly available diverse uses of sites and custom coding. This study introduces the method for integrating Dynamo BIM and Amap web service APIs for the evaluations of publicly available diverse uses and transportations. Additionally, implementations of use cases are demonstrated including assessments of Access to Quality Transit and Diverse Uses in LEED v4. Results from the integrated tool are analyzed and validated with survey results. The analysis of results indicates that the integration method introduced in this paper is effective. The limitations, potentials, and future developments are also discussed. The integration of Dynamo BIM and web service APIs might be useful for site assessments in the early design stage or even earlier. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062271327

Map projections are commonly used to georeference the designed geometries before constructing them on the surface of the Earth. The scale in a map projection varies depending on the position in the map plane, which leads to scale distortions between the designed geometries and the geometries staked out for construction. These distortions are exaggerated for large longitudinal projects such as the construction of roads and railroads because the construction site spans a larger area. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasing in popularity as a way to manage information within a construction project. Its use is more widespread in the building industry, but it is currently being adopted by the infrastructure industry as well. The open BIM standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) has recently developed support for alignment geometries, and full support for disciplines such as road and railroad construction is underway. This study tests whether the current IFC standard can facilitate georeferencing with sufficiently low distortion for the construction of infrastructure. This is done by performing georeferencing using three different methods, all using the information provided in the IFC schema, and by calculating the scale distortions caused by the different methods. It is concluded that the geographic capabilities of the IFC schema could be improved by adding a separate scale factor for the horizontal plane and support for object-specific map projections. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055585349
