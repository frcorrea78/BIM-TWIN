The increase of renewable sources for electrical and thermal energy generation will require flexible and secure supply systems. To reflect and consider these changes in energy systems and buildings, dynamic simulation is one key element. Sparse and limited access to detailed building information as well as computing time are challenges for building simulation on urban-scale. In addition, data acquisition and modelling for building performance simulation (BPS) are time-consuming and error-prone. To enable the use of BPS on urban-scale, this paper presents TEASER, an open framework for urban energy modelling of building stocks (open-source at https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER). TEASER provides an interface for multiple data sources, data enrichment and export of ready-to-run Modelica simulation models. The paper presents TEASER's methodology and package structure. Three use cases show TEASER's capabilities on the building, neighbourhood and urban scales. © 2017 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011850291

In this research, we investigate for the first time whether part of the gap might be caused by the modelling literacy of design teams. A total of 108 building modellers were asked to comment on the importance of obtaining and using accurate values for 21 common modelling input variables, from U-values to occupancy schedules when using dynamic simulation to estimate annual energy demand. The questioning was based on a real building for which high-resolution energy, occupancy and temperature data were recorded. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted using a model of the building (based on the measured data) by perturbing one parameter in each simulation. The effect of each perturbation on the annual energy consumption given by the model was found and a ranked list generated. The order of this list was then compared to that given by the modellers for the same changes in the parameters. A correlation analysis indicated little correlation between which variables were thought to be important by the modellers and which proved to be objectively important. k-means cluster analysis identified subgroups of modellers and showed that 25% of the people tested were making judgements that appeared worse than a person responding at random. Follow-up checks showed that higher level qualifications, or having many years of experience in modelling, did not improve the accuracy of people's predictions. In addition, there was no correlation between modellers, with many ranking some parameters as important that others thought irrelevant. Using a three-part definition of literacy, it is concluded that this sample of modellers, and by implication the population of building modellers, cannot be considered modelling literate. This indicates a new cause of the performance gap. The results suggest a need and an opportunity for both industry and universities to increase their efforts with respect to building physics education, and if this is done, a part of the performance gap could be rapidly closed. Practical application: In any commercial simulation, the modeller will have to decide which parameters must be included and which might be ignored due to lack of time and/or data, and how much any approximations might perturb the results. In this paper, the judgment of 108 modellers was compared against each other. The results show that the internal mental models of thermal modellers disagree with one another, and disagree with the results of a validated thermal model. The lessons learnt will be of great utility to modellers, and those educating the next generation of modellers. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2017.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018314731

In this respect, seismic monitoring networks and proper modelling can further support validation studies, allowing more realistic simulations of what earthquakes can produce. This paper discusses the seismic response of the “Pietro Capuzi” school in Visso, a village located in the Marche region (Italy) that was severely damaged by the 2016–2017 Central Italy earthquake sequence. The school was a two-story masonry structure founded on simple enlargements of its load-bearing walls, partially embedded in the alluvial loose soils of the Nera river. The structure was monitored as a strategic building by the Italian Seismic Observatory of Structures (OSS), which provided acceleration records under both ambient noise and the three mainshocks of the seismic sequence. The evolution of the damage pattern following each one of the three mainshocks was provided by on-site survey integrated by OSS data. Data on the dynamic soil properties was available from the seismic microzonation study of the Visso village and proved useful in the development of a reliable geotechnical model of the subsoil. The equivalent frame (EF) approach was adopted to simulate the nonlinear response of the school building through both fixed-base and compliant-base models, to assess the likely influence of soil–structure interaction on the building performance. The ambient noise records allowed for an accurate calibration of the soil–structure model. The seismic response of the masonry building to the whole sequence of the three mainshocks was then simulated by nonlinear time history analyses by using the horizontal accelerations recorded at the underground floor as input motions. Numerical results are validated against the evidence on structural response in terms of both incremental damage and global shear force–displacement relationships. The comparisons are satisfactory, corroborating the reliability of the compliant-base approach as applied to the EF model and its computational efficiency to simulate the soil–foundation–structure interaction in the case of masonry buildings. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096007292

Since 1980s, the actions to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions led to the inversion of the SO2/NOxproportions in the atmosphere. This study aims at estimating the effects of nitrogen and sulfur compounds on stones by assessing the changes of three building limestones and one reconstituted stone submitted to acid attacks. Two of these stones were already contaminated with sulfates, while the two others were fresh quarried. Two different types of accelerated aging tests were used: (1) the exposition to two mixed acid and saturated atmospheres (HNO3and H2SO3) to simulate the ancient and current pollutants ratio and (2) the immersion in a mixed acid solution (HNO3and H2SO4) and in rainwater (pH 5 and 5.9), with and without agitation to simulate stagnant water and storm runoff water. Macroscopic, binocular and SEM observations, variations of color, weight, porosity, salt content and dissolved calcium were assessed over time. The sulfur amount influences the esthetic alterations such as color changes due to the salt precipitation and the oxidation of metallic compounds. During the immersion tests, the dissolution in the acid solution was more efficient than in the rainwater, due to the combination of the acidity and the karst effects. In the mixed acid atmospheres, the behavior of the porous network depends on the pore size distribution while in the immersion tests it is the open porosity. The high initial sulfur content of the contaminated stones increases the dissolution rate and limits the crystallization. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046366921

However, recent research has documented large differences between actual and predicted energy consumption. In retrofit projects, this difference creates uncertainty about the payback periods and, as a consequence, owners are reluctant to invest in energy-efficient technologies. The differences between the actual and the expected energy consumption are caused by inexact input data on the thermal properties of the building envelope and by the use of standard occupancy data. Integrating occupancy patterns of diversity and variability in behaviour into building simulation can potentially foresee and account for the impact of behaviour in building performance. The presented research develops and applies occupancy heating profiles for building simulation tools in order create more accurate predictions of energy demand and energy performance. Statistical analyses were used to define the relationship between seven most common household types and occupancy patterns in the Netherlands. The developed household profiles aim at providing energy modellers with reliable, detailed and ready-to-use occupancy data for building simulation.

This integrated design process involves multiple disciplines, such as architecture, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The design method heavily relies on utilizing building performance simulation to illustrate how design parameters affect the energy consumption and quality of the indoor environment before actual design decisions are made (Anderson, 2014). The architectural design tools in the integrated design process supersede traditional geometrical exploration instruments, such as Sketchup, Revit, ArchiCad, and Rhino (Negendahl, 2015). More building performance simulating tools, such as Ecotect, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Radiance, and EnergyPlus, have been developed to help architects measure building performance (e.g., natural ventilation, daylighting, solar radiation, and energy uses) in the design process and attain green building standards such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The information presented by these tools guide architects at a certain level in achieving green building goals. However, building simulation is generally beyond the architect’s knowledge domain. Many architects have difficulty in understanding these technical terms and models, as well as their design implications. Therefore, specific consultants have emerged to help architects grasp the meanings of these numbers and models, which require architects to implement a high level of design collaboration and coordination (Aksamija, 2015; Gou & Lau, 2014). Simulation consultants can work in parallel with architects at the early design stage to intervene in the conceptual and schematic design; they may also work behind architects to verify the building performance after the design is finished and make their design green through technical alterations. Most existing literature argues for an early intervention of building performance simulation in the architectural design process and explores different algorithms or models for optimal intervention (Degens, Scholzen, & Odenbreit, 2015; Sick, Schade, Mourtada, Uh, & Grausam, 2014; Svetlana Olbina & Yvan Beliveau, 2007). However, the difference between early intervention and late verification is often not investigated. Few qualitative studies can help understand how the building performance simulation is actually implemented, and how it influences the quality of design solutions in addition to the quantity of performance outcomes. The current research presents two case studies that compare building performance simulation as an early intervention and a late verification tool in the architectural design process, which contextualizes the building simulation research in real building practices. © 2017 by College Publishing.

The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers issued Technical Memorandum 59 (TM59) with the aim of achieving consistency in the modelling processes followed for the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. However, as each tool’s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus influence the overheating risk assessment in flats, while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications. Practical application: Technical Memorandum 59 issued by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers may be widely adopted within the industry to assist the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings.

This analogy to the potential reality of human existence on Mars offers an opportunity to study language use as speakers “make sense” of their experiences in a simulated physical and social unknown. This process is key to understanding how metaphor functions to “wor(l)d-build” by facilitating the cognitive processes that bridge human imagination and emergent reality. This research demonstrates that metaphor is not always about physical experience, but can be shaped by imagination. Subtle shifts in conceptions and expression, such as those prevalent in this study, are symptomatic of larger processes of knowing and potentially inhibiting knowledge about experience.

This study aims to improve student learning outcomes in building physics course by using simulation learning media and models to help students understand thermal comfort material. Making modelling and simulation media is done using MATLAB software. The subjects of this study were physics engineering students who took Building Physics course. At the beginning of the study, students are given material and then in groups discuss thermal contents and then given a pretest test with an average score of 70.27, and for an average grade of 71.3 assignments. At the meeting next week, using the Student-Centered Learning (SCL) method and using problem-based learning in groups, students take temperature measurements in several rooms in the Building at the UNAS Physical Engineering Laboratory. The measurement results show that the room does not have thermal requirements (PERGUB No. 38/2012), so students have the task of conducting experiments using models that have been created by researchers to create learning media to improve comfort in using thermal buildings. Simulation results carried out by students, that is, can produce rooms with thermal conditions at 21-25°C (PERGUB No. 38/2012). This simulation is also able to provide the score of building energy efficiency. After students succeed in conducting the test, the assessment test or posttest is carried out with an average score obtained 80.55, and an average score of 80 assignments. The results of the pretest, assignment 1, assignment 2, and posttest show an increase in students’ scores of 14.6% for the Test and Task Score of 12.20%. Based on the hypothesis test, for both variables showed t-count < t-table and significance < 0.05. It shows there are significant differences in student learning outcomes both test scores and assignment scores before and after using a simulated media. Thus, the system and simulation model designed can be used as learning media that can improve student learning outcomes. © 2020 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087114793
