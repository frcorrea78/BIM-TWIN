This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A reliability-centered predictive maintenance policy is proposed for a continuously monitored system subject to degradation due to the imperfect maintenance. It is assumed that the system hazard rate is a known function of the system condition and then can be derived directly through CBPM. A hybrid hazard rate recursion rule based on the concept of age reduction factor and hazard rate increase factor is built up to predict the evolution of the system reliability in different maintenance cycles. Whenever the system reliability reaches the threshold R, an imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) is performed on the system. The optimal reliability threshold R is determined by minimizing the cumulative maintenance cost per unit time in the residual life of the system which is based on simulation. Finally, a discussion is presented to show how the optimal results depend on the different cost parameters. © 2006.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845605765

This is related to the problem in which some samples are distant, in terms of a given metric, from the rest of the dataset, where these anomalous samples are indicated as outliers. Anomaly detection has recently attracted the attention of the research community, because of its relevance in real-world applications, like intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection and system health monitoring, among many others. Anomalies themselves can have a positive or negative nature, depending on their context and interpretation. However, in either case, it is important for decision makers to be able to detect them in order to take appropriate actions. The petroleum industry is one of the application contexts where these problems are present. The correct detection of such types of unusual information empowers the decision maker with the capacity to act on the system in order to correctly avoid, correct or react to the situations associated with them. In that application context, heavy extraction machines for pumping and generation operations, like turbomachines, are intensively monitored by hundreds of sensors each that send measurements with a high frequency for damage prevention. In this paper, we propose a combination of yet another segmentation algorithm (YASA), a novel fast and high quality segmentation algorithm, with a one-class support vector machine approach for efficient anomaly detection in turbomachines. The proposal is meant for dealing with the aforementioned task and to cope with the lack of labeled training data. As a result, we perform a series of empirical studies comparing our approach to other methods applied to benchmark problems and a real-life application related to oil platform turbomachinery anomaly detection. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921904704

Current facility management (FM) information systems are complex and provide high-quality data. However, they lack interoperability and visualization capabilities. The goal of this study is to improve the quality of data collected that is required for corrective maintenance by utilizing visualization and interoperability capabilities of building information modeling (BIM). To achieve that, an approach that implements industry foundation classes (IFC) BIM to link and present alarms reported by FM systems, such as building energy management systems (BEMS) and building automation systems (BAS), with related data from computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) was developed and validated on a typical university building. The results showed an efficiency increase in high-quality maintenance data collection. The proposed approach supplements the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing a schema that integrates corrective maintenance data in a three-dimensional (3D) IFC-BIM environment. Moreover, it provides a process to minimize the corrective maintenance lead-time and link equipment failures to the related maintenance information. FM practitioners can use this approach to decrease the lead-time needed corrective maintenance responses and focus their resources on productive maintenance tasks. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010465484

Open data standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and specifications such as the Construction Operations Building information exchange (COBie) provide the capability to capture Facilities Management (FM) data requirements in a structured manner from the early stages of project development. We aim to investigate how and whether IFC and COBie can deliver the data and information about assets required by facility managers within a whole life cycle perspective. We focus on specific use cases including the creation of asset registers and service life planning. However, the methodology adopted can be generalised and applied to any other FM use case. The results show that IFC, COBie and the tested supporting tools exhibited some shortcomings in delivering some of the data entities, types and parameters required for the selected FM use cases.

Currently, the majority of building management systems is tightly coupled with the sensors that they utilize, restricting their extensibility. The emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has brought significant benefits as far as monitoring is concerned, since they are more cost-efficient, due to the lack of wiring installations, compared to wired sensor solutions and allow for flexible positioning of the sensors, especially when building retrofitting is concerned. In line with the established move towards integration of enterprise level services, it is beneficial to consider the WSNs within that scope. In this paper, we propose to exploit a service oriented architecture for developing an enterprise networking environment that is used for integrating facilities management applications and building management systems with other operational enterprise functions for the purpose of information sharing and monitoring, controlling, and managing the enterprise environment.

The literature highlights issues that hinder BIM–FM integration, which are studied and discussed in detail in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature is conducted to identify and categorize key issues hampering the application of BIM to FM. This paper has also designed a questionnaire based on a literature review and surveyed FM professionals at two industry events. Using the collected responses, these issues are analyzed and discussed using non-parametric statistical analyses. Findings: A total of 16 issues are identified through the literature review of 54 studies under the four categories of BIM-execution and information-management, technological, cost-based and legal and contractual issues. The results of the survey of FM professionals (with 57 complete responses) reveal that the single most important issue is the lack of FM involvement in project phases when BIM is evolving.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode.

This paper focuses on the challenges connected to the operation phase of buildings, when the adoption of BIM can make information retrieval and management easier and more efficient. More specifically, a BIM-based cyber-physical system for the automated monitoring of buildings during their regular operation is proposed and tested by means of a customised simulator. The system automatically works out key performance indicators based on the overall throughput effectiveness (OTE) metric, assessing both the overall efficiency and the efficiency of every sub-system integrated in the building. Thus, assessments of the contribution of every sub-system to the operation of the building are performed in real-time. In addition, the metric proposed can help manage multi-objective real-time control. The system is self-reconfigurable thanks to the self-similarity assumption of the computational structure that is designed as a holarchy of holonic systems.

Current behavior-intervention techniques extensively rely on occupant-specific energy-use information at the workstation level and often ignore shared appliances. It is because an occupant typically has full responsibility for her workstation appliances energy consumption and shares the responsibility of the shared appliances energy consumption. However, understanding energy-use behavior of both workstation and shared appliances is necessary for applying appropriate behavior-intervention techniques. Despite this importance, there is still no practical and scalable method to capture personalized energy-use information of workstation and shared appliances since the conventional methods use plug-in power meters that are extremely expensive and difficult to maintain over long period of time. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive occupant-level energy-usage approach which utilizes the data from the internet of things devices in office buildings to provide information related to energy-use behavior of workstation and shared appliances of each occupant in an economical and feasible manner. In particular, we introduce an energy behavior index which quantitatively compares individual occupants’ energy-consuming data to identify high energy consumers and inefficient behaviors.

To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis.

This wrong perception of BIM and low interest in 3D asset management (AM) is one of the major reasons for the slow adoption by clients in the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. The purpose of this paper is to identify the techniques and strategies of streamlining AM systems for BIM-based integration, and how the information is captured from physical assets towards BIM-based integration for clients to derive value from BIM investments. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study strategy was used to study the strategic implementation process of integrating BIM with AM systems and the business value of BIM in AM by a large asset owner in the UK. Findings: The paper identifies key strategies in the adoption of BIM-based processes by an asset owner, the implementation process, the challenges and the benefits attained. Several barriers were identified as the challenges of adopting BIM-based processes in AM: complexity and cost associated with BIM; irrelevance of 3D geometric data in AM processes; nature of asset ownership structure; managing the asset handover process; managing change within the organisation. Organisations will have to consider the following issues in streaming asset information with BIM: the development for a clear strategy prior to adoption; connecting the strategy to the business goals; and conducting the discovery exercise to identify organisational information needs. Originality/value: The research addresses a significant gap in the development of techniques and strategies for asset owners to streamline BIM with AM systems and derive business value from such integration. The research context is a case study involving a large owner-operator in the UK that has been able to derive value from BIM systems in their AM processes. The key value of the paper is improving asset owners’ understanding of BIM in AM by demonstrating the implementation strategies, linkage to organisational objectives, challenges, value management process and business value of BIM in AM. Another contribution of the paper is improving the understanding of BIM, which is usually viewed as 3D models and that 3D geometric data do not have much value for AM tasks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063338187

Facility management is a time and labour-intensive service industry, which can greatly benefit from the use of M2M technologies for automating business processes. The need to manage diverse facilities motivates several requirements, such as predictive maintenance, inventory management, access control, location tracking, and remote monitoring, for which an M2M solution would be useful. Our middleware includes software modules for interfacing with intelligent devices that are deployed in customer facilities to sense real-world conditions and control physical devices; communication modules for relaying data from the devices in the customer premises to a centralized data center; and service modules that analyze the data and trigger business events.

In recent years, BIM has been widely used in design and construction phases, but it has not been widely used in operation and maintenance phases, which account for the largest part of the building life cycle. The information required in BIM is different in each of the phases of design, construction, operation, and maintenance, and there are many pieces of reproduced information, making it difficult for managers to utilize the information. Although a number of studies have been conducted on combination of BIM with various technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced sensing equipment in operation and maintenance, and interlinking of the obtained information with BIM information, there have been difficulties in commercialization and field application. This study aims to determine the problems found in previous studies and propose a fusion process in which new technologies adopt and utilize virtual reality techniques such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and head-mounted displays (HMDs) in existing maintenance work, thereby increasing maintenance work efficiency and further improving the utilization of BIM. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

Nevertheless, the sick building syndrome, mainly documented in office buildings, is a widespread problem in many public buildings and, among these, in educational facilities. In these categories we can list school and university buildings where the users are not only workers but also students, sharing anyway the same problem: an artificial environment which is not supporting their productivity in the office or learning performance in the classrooms. Carbon dioxide concentration, due to the natural human breathing process, is a diffuse parameter strongly influencing the indoor air quality and, thus, the users’ wellbeing. An acceptance threshold of 1000 ppm in indoor spaces has been derived for this pollutant. Although allowed, the CO2 concentration in indoor space shouldn't reach this threshold because in such a condition a 11–23% reduction of the users’ cognitive performance has been measured and, when the level increases reaching 2500 ppm, the reported drop is dramatic (44–94%). Extensive researches set the optimal threshold at 600 ppm, a level defined as fresh air. Then, how is it possible to encompass a natural process as CO2 production by humans? Basically with the correct ventilation rate, depending on room geometry, number of people and ventilation system (i.e. natural or mechanical or mixed). A modulating mechanical ventilation system could adapt the ventilation rate according to people density and changing indoor conditions nevertheless many existing buildings have outdated systems not providing this option. Sometimes their air handling units (AHUs) have few regulation options to control the parameters and tuning procedures during the building lifecycle are required. CO2 concentration is convenient to measure indoor air quality because it is easily quantifiable through a sensors network. Thus, it may be adopted as an indicator to assess suitable indoor conditions to human activities and used to trigger manual or automatic procedures to preserve wellbeing thresholds. The article presents a research work depicting the integration of indoor air quality data gathered by internet of things (IoT) sensors to activate the control of the indoor conditions according to the occupancy rate in the educational building eLUX lab, located in the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia. The challenge is to directly regulate the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and define opening/closing patterns for windows to improve the indoor air quality and protect the learning performance of users in dynamic use conditions. The embraced methodology suggests the training of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the actual monitored data and to trigger the ventilation rate control through an IoT communication protocol. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100621800

However, due to the amount of equipment and components in commercial MEP systems, manually creating such logic chains is tedious and fallible work. This paper proposes an approach to generate the logic chains of MEP systems using building information models (BIMs) semi-automatically. The approach consists of three steps: (1) the parametric and nonparametric spatial topological analysis within MEP models to generate a connection table, (2) the transformation of MEP systems and custom information requirements to generate the pre-defined and user-defined identification rules, and (3) the logic chain completion of MEP model based on the graph data structure.

In these cases, the energy saving of buildings depends on the capability to optimise the behaviour of the HVAC.

Building Management System (BMS) is usually used to monitor the thermal condition of buildings. One of BMS's main challenges is in the data visualization stage, in which 2D vector graphics are used, which is not fully interactive and can only be manipulated by a trained operator. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has emerged as a useful tool in the construction industry, which can be applied in all stages of a project lifecycle. The use of BIM in facilities management is currently limited since BIM applications have primarily been implemented within the design and construction phases. The main objective of this study is to integrate a sensor-based alert system into BIM models for thermal comfort monitoring in buildings during the operational phase and visualize a building's thermal condition virtually. In order to improve the performance of environmental monitoring management of buildings in smart cities, this research presents a newly developed integrated solution based on a BIM platform and Internet of Things (IoT). The designed prototype explores the integration of commercial BIM platforms with sensor data to create a self-updating BIM model to provide real-time thermal condition monitoring based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard within an office environment. The temperature and humidity values, measured by sensors, are sent to the MySQL database server. An integrated workflow was developed to compile, standardize, integrate, and visualize monitoring data in a BIM environment to facilitate interpretation, analysis, and monitoring data exchange. The developed system was able to detect the time and location of a case study office room experiencing the levels of thermal comfort/discomfort based on the targeted thresholds. In this case, thirteen levels of thermal discomfort cases, out of forty-nine data points during the test, were detected, and the developed system was also able to generate a trigger and transmit alarms to facility managers via their wireless devices in real-time. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is a visually effective monitoring system for environmental monitoring management. The fully automated developed system is expected to provide a robust and practical tool for reliable data collection, analysis, and visualization to facilitate intelligent monitoring of the thermal condition in buildings and help decision-makers make faster and better decisions, which may help in maintaining the level of occupants’ thermal comfort to a satisfactory level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096837952

Based on a mix of commercial and in-house hardware developments, the proposed system offers an immediate economic P&BMS solution for any size of building while future software enhancement will incorporate asset management, energy monitoring, and targeting systems. Although primarily intended as a stand-alone system for use by power and building services groups, this system provides facilities which allow the system to form part of a fully integrated telecommunications network maintenance facility.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022863262

When a robot is equipped with dangerous tools, moves at a high speed or carries heavy loads, the current safety legislation requires the continuous on-line monitoring of the robot’s speed and a suitable separation distance from human workers. The present paper proposes to make a virtue out of necessity by extending the scope of on-line monitoring to predicting failures and safe stops. This has been done by implementing a platform, based on open access tools and technologies, to monitor the parameters of a robot during the execution of collaborative tasks. An automatic machine learning (ML) tool on the edge of the network can help to perform the on-line predictions of possible outages of collaborative robots, especially as a consequence of human-robot interactions. By exploiting the on-line monitoring system, it is possible to increase the reliability of collaborative work, by eliminating any unplanned downtimes during execution of the tasks, by maximising trust in safe interactions and by increasing the robot’s lifetime. The proposed framework demonstrates a data management technique in industrial robots considered as a physical cyber-system. Using an assembly case study, the parameters of a robot have been collected and fed to an automatic ML model in order to identify the most significant reliability factors and to predict the necessity of safe stops of the robot. Moreover, the data acquired from the case study have been used to monitor the manipulator’ joints; to predict cobot autonomy and to provide predictive maintenance notifications and alerts to the end-users and vendors. © 2021 by the authors.
