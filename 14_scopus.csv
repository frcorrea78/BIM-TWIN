Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party.

We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties interact with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs. To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of cryptography. The formal modeling is of independent interest.

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as 'miner' that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain. We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy. We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030479533

These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology. Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real.

The information of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people's information are collected and stored into the system. So much information provides the cornerstone for the development of big data, if such data is tampered with or leaked, it will cause irreparable serious damage. However, in recent years, electronic archives have exposed a series of problems such as information leakage, information tampering, and information loss, which has made the reform of personnel information management more and more urgent. The unique characteristics of the blockchain, such as non-tampering and traceability make it have great application potential in personnel information management, and can effectively solve many problems of traditional file management. However, the blockchain is limited by its own shortcomings such as small storage space and slow synchronization time, and cannot be directly applied to the big data field. This paper proposes a personnel management system based on blockchain, we analyzed the defects of the blockchain and proposed an improved method, constructs a novel data storage model of on-chain and out-of-chain that can effectively solve the problem of data redundancy and insufficient storage space. Based on this, we developed a prototype system with query, add, modify, and track personnel information, verified the feasibility of applying blockchain to personnel information management, explore the possibility of combining blockchain with big data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069894691

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage.

Digital Twin relies on the continuously accumulated data and real-time presentation of the collected data to simultaneously update and modify with its physical counterpart. However, presenting a huge amount of collected data and information in a Digital Twin in an intuitive manner remains a challenge. Currently, augmented reality (AR) has been widely implemented in the manufacturing environment, such as product design, data management, assembly instructions, and equipment maintenance. By integrating graphics, audios and real-world objects, AR allows the users to visualise and interact with Digital Twin data at a new level. It gives the opportunity to provide intuitive and continual visualisation of the Digital Twin data.

Whereas the conventional thinking is to store an entire BIM model or its signature code in blockchain, SDT captures local model changes as SDT records and assembles them into a BIM change contract (BCC). In this way, the version history of a BIM project becomes a chain of timestamped BCCs, and stakeholders can promptly synchronize BIM changes in blockchain. We test our approach in two pilot cases.

Implementation of blockchain technology in the construction industry can also result in the use of smart contracts with fewer administrative struggles, improve the flow of the project, material, and service delivery, and increase the security and currentness of BIM or project documents. This study aims to explore the applications of blockchain technology in improving the construction industry’s information management systems. It is concluded that not only the blockchain technology has potential in addressing some of the common problems in the construction industry but also it is adaptable to the construction industry structure and the way it is practiced. Thus, blockchain technology is a viable option for adaptation in the construction industry. Copyright © 2019 ISEC Press.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087227876

In fact, the adoption of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) based on IoT along with cloud computing systems has led to the development of new methodologies to monitor and treat patients. However, the adoption of the new technologies comes with several challenges in terms of performance and security. Considering that, WBAN can be wearable or implanted under the skin, and the overall concept leads to several cybersecurity challenges that would require deeper investigation. This chapter presents an analysis of the impact that WBAN has on health care. It also provides some definitions of Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPSs) and Digital Twins along with technological enablers such as cloud and IoT.

The management and coordination of the connected vehicles is based on periodic communications among the vehicles involved in the network, and with their surrounding environment. However, a major concern regarding this information sharing process is how to provide a secure transmission while fulfilling the latency requirements. Here we propose the use of a joint paradigm to securely manage the inter-vehicular communications. First, a ring-signature based scheme is applied to verify the identity of the vehicles joining the network. Second, the information is shared among the vehicles and consensually verified using a blockchain-based mechanism using secure communication channels created by multi-party smart contracts. The proposed protocol fulfills the stringent requirements in latency for vehicular networks by means of almost instantaneous communications while providing an anonymous secure system for the members of the network relying on cryptographic primitives. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053516546

Due to varying routes and a high variance of workpieces, material flows in cyber-physical production systems can get highly complex, which can lead to physically induced disturbances that can result in accidents or decreased throughput and high costs. This issue can be addressed by applying a physics engine to simulate the physical interaction between workpieces and the material handling systems during the operation. Connecting such a digital model to a real material handling system in order to derive simulation-based decision support leads to the concept of digital twins. To date, few practical implementations of digital twins in manufacturing outside the machine tool domain were reported. Therefore, this paper describes the modeling and the subsequent implementation of an integrated system that consists of a real material handling system and its digital twin, based on physics simulation. A practical use case demonstrates the versatile advantages of the implemented solution for a manufacturing system with respect to the three digital twin functions prediction, monitoring and diagnosis. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085323138

Applications of blockchain range from cryptocurrency, smart contract, banking, healthcare and identity management, insurance, land registry to IoT industry. However, scalability and throughput issues are major challenges of blockchain and are less researched. Many lightweight nodes especially IoT devices depend and put much workload on blockchain servers since they cannot store the full blockchain due to its huge size. This paper investigates performance bottlenecks in blockchain and presents efficient high performance system for caching the blockchain data in the FPGA network interface controller (NIC) for improving scalability and throughput of blockchain applications. We design a customized SHA-256 hash core specific for efficient blockchain caching to save hashing executions and improve the performance. We built and use Jansson and Curl libraries to interface our system with real Bitcoin core. We finally evaluate the throughput performance of the Bitcoin core. The overall result revealed that our system improves the throughput performance by 103 times when cache hit. The design also offers small work area utilization, low power consumption and higher performance. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063158020

At the core of the concept lies the inclusion of the entire asset lifecycle. To enable all lifecycle parties to partake, the Digital Twin should provide a sharable data base. Thereby, integrity and confidentiality issues are pressing, turning security into a major requirement. However, given that the Digital Twin paradigm is still at an early stage, most works do not consider security yet. Distributed ledgers provide a novel technology for multi-party data sharing that emphasizes security features such as integrity. For this reason, we examine the applicability of distributed ledgers to secure Digital Twin data sharing. We contribute to current literature by identifying requirements for Digital Twin data sharing in order to overcome current infrastructural challenges. We furthermore propose a framework for secure Digital Twin data sharing based on Distributed Ledger Technology.

The paper further puts forwards six propositions on the city-level digital twin agenda, which stem from an ongoing research project on smart cities at the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction. It is argued that the development of a digital twin is progressive, where the digital twin as a technical apparatus and the social system that develops, operates and uses the digital twin must co-evolve together. On the one hand, our existing knowledge about cities and infrastructure would define how well we could build and evaluate the digital twin; on the other hand, thanks to artificial intelligence, the digital twin could potentially produce new knowledge that complements ours. In the context of developing smart cities, the paper points out that the digital twin is not a context-free technology that can be simply purchased and installed onto existing governance systems. To develop a purposeful digital twin application, the insights and changes from the governance perspective are essential. The paper also introduces the research plan for developing a digital twin pilot for the Cambridge sub-region, which serves as a case study to test the proposed propositions. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090989616

These challenges have significantly compromised the productivity and economic benefits of the construction industry. Further, construction activities have been linked to significant emissions, particularly CO2 associated with global warming. This study proposes a new paradigm of construction – Lego-inspired construction, and investigates the feasibility. Inspired by Lego blocks that can be assembled via dry joints and disassembled for different objects, this study presents blocks made using a bendable concrete, aiming to assemble various structures with dry joints. The blocks are used to assemble a prototype footbridge to demonstrate the assembling process, which is compatible with robotic systems for construction automation. The footbridge demonstrated reasonable load-carrying capability in mechanical testing. After the testing, the footbridge was disassembled, and the blocks were reused to assemble a frame for buildings. The proposed Lego-inspired construction is promising to greatly improve the construction efficiency and reduce the adverse impacts on the natural environment caused by conventional construction approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081043914

But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks.The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from.Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited.However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data.Within this paper a cross section of blockchain consensus protocols have been assessed against a requirement framework, to establish each consensus protocols strengths and weaknesses with respect to their potential implementation in an Internet of Things blockchain environment. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065526112

Exploiting the advantages of object-oriented modeling, this DT has been built ensuring that it may be dynamically adapted to different monitoring scenarios. Moreover, its adaptability is tested showing that reduced models behave similarly. The resulting reduced models are used to estimate installation parameters in a bottom-up way, using the measurements of a scaled test bench.
