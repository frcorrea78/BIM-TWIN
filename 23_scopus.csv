We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973882748

Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation.

These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the ""as-is"" conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large, highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873283130

While recently developed methods in this domain focus on mere local surface reconstructions which enable e.g. efficient visualization, our approach aims for a volumetric, parametric building model that additionally incorporates contextual information such as global wall connectivity. In contrast to pure surface reconstructions, our representation thereby allows more comprehensive use: first, it enables efficient high-level editing operations in terms of e.g. wall removal or room reshaping which always result in a topologically consistent representation. Second, it enables easy taking of measurements like e.g. determining wall thickness or room areas. These properties render our reconstruction method especially beneficial to architects or engineers for planning renovation or retrofitting. Following the idea of previous approaches, the reconstruction task is cast as a labeling problem which is solved by an energy minimization. This global optimization approach allows for the reconstruction of wall elements shared between rooms while simultaneously maintaining plausible connectivity between all wall elements. An automatic prior segmentation of the point clouds into rooms and outside area filters large-scale outliers and yields priors for the definition of labeling costs for the energy minimization. The reconstructed model is further enriched by detected doors and windows. We demonstrate the applicability and reconstruction power of our new approach on a variety of complex real-world datasets requiring little or no parameter adjustment. © 2015 The Authors.

Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University’s city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year.

This article presents a novel segmentation-free derivative-free optimization (DFO) approach that translates the generation of as-built BIMs from 2D images into an optimization problem of fitting BIM components regarding architectural and topological constraints. The semantics of the BIMs are subsequently enriched by linking the fitted components with existing semantics sources. The approach was prototyped in two experiments using an outdoor and an indoor case, respectively.

As modern design methods using Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have been increasingly adopted by the AEC industry, construction quality assessment using BIM has become a challenging new task for practitioners. In the past few years, 3D as-built models for construction quality assessment have been developed using data acquisition techniques like 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry. However, certain limitations like non-affordability, requiring expertise to operate, and dependence on time-consuming processes are restricting their usage for construction quality control purposes. The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of using a new, affordable, easy to use, and faster modeling technology (Project Tango) to produce 3D as-built models for facilitating the construction quality control process. For this purpose, a construction project was chosen as a case study and three different scenarios (including interior and exterior environments) were modelled using Project Tango. A post-processing method was developed to prepare the scanned as-built models for comparison with the design BIM. The accuracy level of these as-built models were also evaluated using dimension accuracy analysis. The prepared as-built models and the design BIM were then integrated and adjusted in the Autodesk Navisworks environment to perform the quality control assessment.

Their web-based provision, in particular on mobile devices, represents a key challenge for system and application development. In contrast to approaches based on streaming 3D scene data to clients, our approach splits 3D rendering into two processes: A server process is responsible for real-time rendering of virtual panoramas, represented by G-buffer cube maps, for a requested camera setting. The client reconstruction process uses these cube maps to reconstruct the 3D scene and allows users to operate on and interact with that representation. The key properties of this approach include that (a) the complexity of transmitted data not depend on the 3D scene's complexity; (b) 3D rendering can take place within a controlled and a-priori known server environment; (c) crucial 3D model data never leaves the server environment; and (d) the clients can flexibly extend the 3D cube map viewer by adding both local 3D models and specialized 3D operations. © 2012 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865566807

Such devices are inextricably linked to modern digital built environment practices, particularly when used in conjunction with as-built building information modelling (BIM) development. The research also reports upon innovative technological advancements (such as machine vision) that coalesce with 3D scanning solutions. Design/methodology/approach: A synthesis of literature is used to develop: a hierarchy of the modes of delivery for laser scan devices; a thematic analysis of 3D terrestrial laser scan technology applications; and a componential cross-comparative tabulation of laser scan technology and specifications. Findings: Findings reveal that the costly and labour intensive attributes of laser scanning devices have stimulated the development of hybrid automated and intelligent technologies to improve performance. Such developments are set to satisfy the increasing demand for digitisation of both existing and new buildings into BIM. Future work proposed will seek to: review what coalescence of digital technologies will provide an optimal and cost-effective solution to accurately re-constructing the digital built environment; conduct case studies that implement hybrid digital solutions in pragmatic facilities management scenarios to measure their performance and user satisfaction; and eliminate manual remodelling tasks (such as point cloud reconstruction) via the use of computational intelligence algorithms integral within cloud-based BIM platforms. Originality/value: Although laser scanning and 3D modelling have been widely covered en passant within the literature, scant research has conducted a holistic review of the technology, its applications and future developments. This review presents concise and lucid reference guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both practitioners and researchers. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023594741

The embedded sensors allow the device to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating its position and orientation in real-time, and combining that data into a single 3D model of the space around it. This arrangement allows users to create experiences such as indoor navigation, 3D mapping, augmented reality, physical space measurement, and environment recognition in a virtual world. The aim of this research study is to investigate the scope and accuracy of Google Tango® tablet for generating 3D point cloud based scans that could be used for schematic designing, space management, and for renovations and retrofitting planning. In addition, other functionalities of Tango® tablet that could be useful to designers, constructors, and facility managers (FM) are investigated. A mixed-methods approach was adopted for this study. Four testing scenarios were designed to collect the necessary quantitative data. In addition, interviews with BIM/laser scanning professionals were conducted to get their insight. The data analysis indicated that the accuracy of 3D scans in most cases is within ± 5% of actual measurements which is fairly reasonable for schematic planning. Hence this technology could provide significant cost and time savings for the design, construction and FM industries. The paper first discusses the main concept and applications of Tango® tablet. After that, its possible applications for design, construction, and facility management are illustrated. This is followed by a brief discussion on the methodology and data collection methods. Based on the presented results, major findings and conclusions are outlined and recommendations for researchers and practitioners are presented.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032377324

These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050601423

It addresses the steady need to validate, update and combine BIM, in particular based on in-situ captured point clouds, throughout the whole lifecycle of buildings and facilities. To assess the present as-built interior and exterior in comparison to the as-designed or as-documented building representations, our techniques allow for deviation analysis and visualization, which serve as an effective method for enhancing stakeholder engagement. For example, Facility Management (FM) stakeholders can use deviation analysis and visualization to identify, inspect and monitor any spatial alterations both for interior and exterior building parts. Visualized instantaneous deviations can inform stakeholders of further need for investigation; they may not even have architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) expertise or access to BIM software. We describe a prototypical implementation that demonstrates the application of comparative deviation analysis and visualization. Finally, we discuss how the visualization output can provide a tool for a variety of stakeholders to improve applications and workflows for FM. © 2018 WIT Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047237914
