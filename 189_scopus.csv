A range of software programs is then used to combine the image and scan data.Findings - Meshing of the point cloud followed by texturing from the image data creates a framework for the creation of a 3D model. Mapping of BIM objects onto the 3D surface model is the final stage in the reverse engineering process, creating full 2D and 3D models including detail behind the object's surface concerning its methods of construction and material makeup, this new process is described as HBIM.Originality/value - The future research within this area will concentrate on three main stands. The initial strand is to attempt improve the application of geometric descriptive language to build complex parametric objects. The second stand is the development of a library of parametric based on historic data (from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books). Finally, while it is possible to plot parametric objects onto the laser scan data, there is need to identify intermediate software platforms to accelerate this stage within the HBIM framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350367834

EniServizi, aware of the BIM potential role in the complex building and infrastructure domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM based on laser scanner and photogrammetric surveying to address decision-making processes among the different actors involved in the preservation process. The Basilica of Collemaggio has been re-opened to the public on December 2017. This paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in relation to both positive and critical aspects relating HBIM feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging restoration and preservation field. The theoretical and practical HBIM approach here tackled overcomes the current BIM logic based on the sequential process adopted by the AIA and NBS Level of Development (LOD), characterized by a simple-to-complex-detailing process, working in the new construction domain and generally following the conceptualizing phase, the preliminary design, the executive design, the construction phase till to the facility management. A complex-mixed LOD approach, able to entail the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each component and to get the maximum degree of knowledge, has been experimented in order to derive informed decisions in terms of preservation, restoration and management since the starting phases of the architectural design. To this aim, a Level of Geometry (LOG) coherent to the Level of Accuracy gained by the high-resolution surveys has been adapted to the specificity of the restoration process of a historic monument and is here proposed through different Grade of Generation (GOG) protocols developed in the object modelling to support the preliminary and definitive design proposal of the conservation plan of the Basilica. Particularly, a NURBS-based parametric generative modelling process (GOG9-10) is here proposed in order to get models “BIM abled” to describe the complex geometry and to match the related information. Specific Level of Information (LOI) has been introduced to support the preservation process, to document the as-built and the management of the building after the intervention, moving HBIM toward multi-actor domain. Given the effort required by such approach, obtaining a cost-effective HBIM modelling embodying the complexity of each damaged element as acquired by the surveys (i.e. walls, pillars, vaults, beams) represents a challenging issue. The result of the overall process aims to contribute in lowering the initial HBIM modelling costs by deploying a sustainable complexity delivering protocols and specification and by boosting at the same time an interoperable cooperative HBIM habit among multi-actors across all the phases, spreading its usability after the restoration process. On the lesson learnt, the process of updating the current Codification criteria (UNI11337-2009) has been started with a draft proposal stimulating the debate for the future of HBIM adoption in the case of restoration, preservation and maintenance (UNI11337-2017): in the conviction that transferring the HBIM richness into the Life Cycle Management process will allow multi-actors to take in account the knowledge and information gained during the restoration, integrating the as-built updating and keeping updated the monument monitoring during the time being. © 2018, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055423071

In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020011815

Part of it is carried out within the INTERREG EU project framework, which aims to the valuation and dissemination of the role of the Church of S. Maria di Scaria (Vall' Intelvi) in the international European exchange of skills in the past centuries. It mainly focuses on the Carloni's intervention (XVIII century), a local family of craftsmen, famous across many European cities and regions for the construction of monuments with rich decorations. In this way they managed to send holy gifts and money, but also offered their skills in order to enrich the church of Scaria as a symbol of their success. The laser scanning and photogrammetric surveys have been carried out with the on-site stratigraphic analysis and with the quest for the scarcely available historical documents, in an attempt to study the reconstruction and the main transformations and chronological phases, from the Romanic to the Baroque interventions and to the more recent ones: An integrated BIM approach has been chosen as an experimental way of transmitting a piece of the history of the church life to the local people and also for touristic purposes. In order to disseminate the information on the transformations of the building and on the various decorations in a way that would facilitate the readability and interpretation of the monument by the visitors, a little local museum, co-funded by the EU Interreg programme, is planned to be realized mainly containing the exhibition of the collections of the sacred vessels and furnishings donated to the church in the past. To enhance this aim a 3D object modeling will also be exposed in the multimedia section of the museum. A Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) has been developed, while investigating the potential of an object library specially generated to illustrate the various structural elements, the multiple construction technologies for the walls, the vault system, the roof etc., and the decorative layers (frescos, stuccos and frames), along with the critical aspects faced by standard BIM in a complex geometry shift from Surface approach to Object modeling. The research contributes to the explanation of the sequence and construction technologies adopted for the vault system, the first two vaults of the nave (their interesting texturing and the particular geometry registered by laser scanning related to the hypothesized centering), with respect to the vault covering the altar and the apse.

It describes the diffusion of as-built BIM approach in the last years in Heritage Assets management, the so-called Built Heritage Information Modelling/Management (BHIMM or HBIM), that is nowadays an important and sustainable perspective in documentation and administration of historic buildings and structures. The work focuses the documentation derived from 3D survey techniques that can be understood like a significant and unavoidable knowledge base for the BIM conception and modelling, in the perspective of a coherent and complete management and valorisation of CH. It deepens potentialities, offered by 3D integrated survey techniques, to acquire productively and quite easilymany 3D information, not only geometrical but also radiometric attributes, helping the recognition, interpretation and characterization of state of conservation and degradation of architectural elements. From these data, they provide more and more high descriptive models corresponding to the geometrical complexity of buildings or aggregates in the well-known 5D (3D + time and cost dimensions). Points clouds derived from 3D survey acquisition (aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, LiDAR and their integration) are reality-based models that can be use in a semi- Automatic way to manage, interpret, and moderately simplify geometrical shapes of historical buildings that are examples, as is well known, of non-regular and complex geometry, instead of modern constructions with simple and regular ones. In the paper, some of these issues are addressed and analyzed through some experiences regarding the creation and the managing of HBIMprojects on historical heritage at different scales, using different platforms and various workflow. The paper focuses on LiDAR data handling with the aim to manage and extract geometrical information; on development and optimization of semi- Automatic process of segmentation, recognition and modelling of historical shapes of complex structures; on communication of historical heritage by virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) in a 3D reconstruction of buildings aggregates from a LiDAR and UAV survey.

The current challenge still involves the extraction of geometric primitives and the establishment of their connection to heterogeneous knowledge. As a recently developed 3D information modeling environment, building information modeling (BIM) entails both graphical and non-graphical aspects of the entire building, which has been increasingly applied to heritage documentation and generates a new issue of heritage/historic BIM (HBIM). However, HBIM needs to additionally deal with the heterogeneity of geometric shape and semantic knowledge of the heritage object. This paper developed a new mesh-to-HBIM modeling workflow and an integrated BIM management system to connect HBIM elements and historical knowledge. Using the St-Pierre-le-Jeune Church, Strasbourg, France as a case study, this project employs Autodesk Revit as a BIM environment and Dynamo, a built-in visual programming tool of Revit, to extend the new HBIM functions. The mesh-to-HBIM process segments the surface mesh, thickens the triangle mesh to 3D volume, and transfers the primitives to BIM elements. The obtained HBIM is then converted to the ontology model to enrich the heterogeneous knowledge. Finally, HBIM geometric elements and ontology semantic knowledge is joined in a unified BIM environment. By extending the capability of the BIM platform, the HBIM modeling process can be conducted in a time-saving way, and the obtained HBIM is a semantic model with object-oriented knowledge. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069581674

In recent years, the use of Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) has grown prevalent and thus provided a research opportunity. Differing from newly constructed buildings, structural components of historic buildings come with unique physical configurations and have amassed impressive amount of restoration data, all of which must be taken into consideration when incorporating Building Information Modeling. In terms of modelling, it is critical to determine the appropriate level of detail (LoD), level of information (LoI), especially the comprehensiveness and expandability of the database. International Committee for Documentation/Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) is a widely accepted standard for ontology model. This study aims to integrate the HBIM and CIDOC CRM to construct a framework and comprehensive operational procedure for the modeling of traditional Minan architecture and a database with complete semantics archiving the background and restoration data. Autodesk A360 is ideal for collaborative. However, there are limitations when it comes to developing advanced models for data management or query; interactive experience; meeting model applications derived from future scenarios. Therefore, the study also offers a 3D modeling platform constructed using Unity, as well as a comparison of the platforms built with Unity, three.js and Autodesk A360 as a reference for users. © 2021 The Author(s).

This framework includes acquisition of point cloud data through laser scanning. Unlike previous studies, in this study, a standard for authoring BIM data was established through comparative analysis of existing archives and point cloud data, and a method of building valuable BIM data as an information model was proposed. From a short-term perspective, additional archives such as member lists and drawings can be extracted from BIM data built as an information model. In addition, from a long-term perspective, a scenario for using the cultural heritage archive consisting of historical records, point cloud data, and BIM data was presented. These scenarios were verified through a case study. In particular, through the BIM data building and management method, relatively very light BIM data (499 MB) could be built based on point cloud data (more than 917 MB), which is a large amount of data. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092675597

The development of an HBIM model for ancient wooden architecture (AWA) structures requires interdisciplinary integration. A parametric model for the main components that intelligently integrates the historical knowledge, as well as an intelligent modeling method for these components, are two critical issues required to bridge the existing gap and improve the application of HBIM. Taking an AWA structure constructed during the Liao and Song Dynasties as an example, the parametric model for the typical components, with emphasis on commonality and characteristics, were first proposed. Subsequently, an intelligent automated modeling method was developed and programmed using Dynamo, which can intelligently identify the component type and determine the invisible dimensions. A complicated dou-gong was successfully established with surveying data using the proposed method within five minutes, thereby validating the reliability and efficiency of this method. Furthermore, the proposed method was used to establish the HBIM model of Yingxian Wood Pagoda, which is the oldest and tallest AWA structure in China with a height of 65.88 m. The research findings will provide an essential reference for the conservation of wooden architectural heritage structures. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081962068

As a method of measurement, in the past, the measurement was conducted using tools such as a person's hand and thread, but with the recent advancement in technology, a method of increasing the accuracy by using a 3D scanner in addition to the measurement of a person has been used. However, the current method of using 3D scan data is a situation in which 3D scanned point cloud data is organized to show the entire shape or to image and use some areas to be drawn.
