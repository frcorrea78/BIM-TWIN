The proposed methodology advocates analytic parameter selection directly from the training data, rather than re-sampling approaches commonly used in SVM applications. In particular, we describe a new analytical prescription for setting the value of insensitive zone ε, as a function of training sample size. Good generalization performance of the proposed parameter selection is demonstrated empirically using several low- and high-dimensional regression problems. Further, we point out the importance of Vapnik's ε-insensitive loss for regression problems with finite samples. To this end, we compare generalization performance of SVM regression (using proposed selection of ε-values) with regression using 'least-modulus' loss (ε=0) and standard squared loss. These comparisons indicate superior generalization performance of SVM regression under sparse sample settings, for various types of additive noise. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

This paper introduces an environment aware beacon deployment algorithm designed by the authors to support a sequence based localization schema for locating first responders and trapped occupants at building fire emergency scenes. The algorithm is designed to achieve dual objectives of improving room-level localization accuracy and reducing the effort required to deploy an ad-hoc sensor network, as the required sensing infrastructure is presumably unavailable at most emergency scenes. The deployment effort is measured by the number of beacons to deploy, and the location accessibility to deploy the beacons. The proposed algorithm is building information modeling (BIM) centered, where BIM is integrated to provide the geometric information of the sensing area as input to the algorithm for computing space division quality, a metric that measures the likelihood of correct room-level estimations and associated deployment effort. BIM also provides a graphical interface for user interaction. Metaheuristics are integrated to efficiently search for a satisfactory solution in order to reduce the computational time, which is crucial for the success of emergency response operations. The algorithm was evaluated by simulation, where two building fire emergency scenarios were simulated. The tabu search, which employs dynamically generated constraints to guide the search for optimum solutions, was found to be the most efficient among three tuned tested metaheuristics. The algorithm yielded an average room-level accuracy of 87.1% and 32.1% less deployment effort on average compared with random beacon placements. The robustness of the algorithm was also examined as the deployed ad-hoc sensor network is subject to various hazards at emergency scenes. Results showed that the room-level accuracy could remain above 80% when up to 54% of all deployed nodes were damaged. The tradeoff between the space division quality and deployment effort was also examined, which revealed the relationship between the total deployment effort and localization accuracy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In Taiwan, the response to an organization of fire prevention and disaster relief as well as evacuation planning and rescue guidance continue to rely primarily on human-provided intelligence. This method makes disaster-response decision-making inherently prone to error due to the inaccuracy, incompleteness, and poor communication of this intelligence.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for maintenance planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078707972

Issues of security and crime prevention, however, are in many cases neglected. Moreover, when researchers do introduce new smart security technologies, they rarely discuss their implementation or question how new smart city security might affect traditional policing and urban planning processes. This systematic review explores the recent literature concerned with new ‘smart city’ security technologies and aims to investigate to what extent these new interventions correspond with traditional functions of security interventions. Through an extensive literature search we compiled a list of security interventions for smart cities and suggest several changes to the conceptual status quo in the field. Ultimately, we propose three clear categories to categorise security interventions in smart cities: Those interventions that use new sensors but traditional actuators, those that seek to make old systems smart, and those that introduce entirely new functions. These themes are then discussed in detail and the importance of each group of interventions for the overall field of urban security and governance is assessed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078506214

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

In Taiwan, about 100 firefighters die during fire rescues each year, primarily because they are unaware of the causes of the fire and unfamiliar with the location's environment. Meanwhile, evacuees often die in the panic of evacuation. To solve these problems, this research proposes a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based visualization and warning system for fire rescue. A fire dynamics simulator (FDS) simulates various conditions of structural fires in conjunction with the visualization and integration properties of BIM, and the simulation results for temperature, carbon monoxide, and visibility can be integrated and presented in the BIM model for briefing purposes before rescue operations begin.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform. The demonstrator also includes two applications: (1) improving asset maintenance and asset tracking using Augmented Reality (AR); and (2) equipment failure prediction. The long-term goals of this demonstrator are also discussed in this paper. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085260931

However, some problems still exist that hamper the development of prefabrication projects. To improve PC project performance and advance innovation in construction, this study introduces an innovative method that incorporates Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Long Range (LoRa) technologies, sensor networks, the BIM model and cloud computing to automatically collect, analyze and display real-time information about PC components. It can locate PC components on a construction site and monitor their structural performance during the installation process. RFID technology and strain sensors were used to collect the required data on a construction site. All the data was transmitted to a server using LoRa technology. Then, the cloud-based Building Information Modelling (BIM) model of the project was developed to store and vividly present project information and real-time onsite data. Moreover, the cloud-based BIM model enables project team members to access the project information from anywhere by using mobile devices. The proposed system was tested on a real PC project to validate its effectiveness. The results indicate that the sensor network can provide reliable data via LoRa technology, and a PC component can be accurately located on site. Also, the monitoring data of structural performance for the PC component during the installation process is acceptable.

Both ideas are increasingly popular in academic literature. Yet, little is known about their understanding by the practitioners such as policymakers, third sector organisations and citizens. Two case studies, a community-based energy efficiency initiative, and a local authority electric vehicle policy were critically reviewed using discourse analysis. The method helped to reveal the explicit, implied and obscured aims of the examined initiatives. Using discourse analysis, the researchers developed a heuristic which could improve traditional policy analysis approaches. The examination of case studies illustrates how practitioners understand the notions of “urban climate justice” and “smart cities” and whether their conceptualisations differ from those present in the academic literature. Finally, the paper offers methodological suggestions for embedding justice in “smart” initiatives at each stage of policy and project design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063193307

Therefore, building owners and managers have been known to adjust environmental physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality based on people’s subjective sensations to yield satisfactory feelings of comfort. Furthermore, electricity consumption could be reduced by minimizing unnecessary use of heating and cooling equipment based on precise knowledge of comfort levels in interior spaces. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, this study undertook the following four tasks: first, providing visualization and smart suggestion functions to assist building managers and users in analyzing and developing plans based on the demands of space usage and electrical equipment; second, using Internet of Things technology to minimize the difference between real situations and those simulated in building information modeling (BIM); third, accurately evaluating interior environment comfort levels and improving equipment operating efficiency based on quantized comfort levels; and fourth, establishing a persuasive workflow for building energy saving systems.

This research proposes a fire evacuation management framework which takes advantage of an information-rich building information modeling (BIM) model and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based indoor real-time location system (RTLS) to dynamically push personalized evacuation route recommendations and turn-by-turn guidance to the smartphone of a building occupant. The risk score (RS) for each possible route is evaluated as a weighted summation of risk level index values of all risk factors for all segments along the route, and the route with the lowest RS is recommended to the evacuee. The system will automatically re-evaluate all routes every 2 s based on the most updated information, and the evacuee will be notified if a new and safer route becomes available. A case study with two testing scenarios was conducted for a commercial oce building in Tianjin, China, in order to verify this framework. © Sensors (Switzerland) 2019.

The digital twin technology can be used to monitor the structural behavior, state, and activity of a steel structure throughout its life cycle, which is equivalent to performing a safety assessment of the structure. The purpose of this study is to establish a digital twin multidimensional model of prestressed steel structures. Based on this model, the support vector machine and prediction model are trained using the relevant structural history data, and the safety risk level of the structure is then predicted based on the measured data. Finally, a proportional reduction model of the wheel-spoke cable truss structure is used to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.
