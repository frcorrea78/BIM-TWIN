One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted mean vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031624196

These changes, in turn, seem to be setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research. This article presents a literature review of major changes, developments, and trends in the field of thermal comfort research over the last 20 years. One of the main paradigm shift was the fundamental conceptual reorientation that has taken place in thermal comfort thinking over the last 20 years; a shift away from the physically based determinism of Fanger's comfort model toward the mainstream and acceptance of the adaptive comfort model. Another noticeable shift has been from the undesirable toward the desirable qualities of air movement. Additionally, sophisticated models covering the physics and physiology of the human body were developed, driven by the continuous challenge to model thermal comfort at the same anatomical resolution and to combine these localized signals into a coherent, global thermal perception. Finally, the demand for ever increasing building energy efficiency is pushing technological innovation in the way we deliver comfortable indoor environments. These trends, in turn, continue setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research for the next decades. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887201408

This article contributes to this process by presenting a conceptual frame-work that identifies four overarching social concepts and links them to environmental imperatives. These concepts are: public awareness, equity, participation, and social cohesion. The framework builds on concepts and policy objectives outlined in research on international sustainable development indicators and the social sustainability literature. The social pillar can be expanded to include environmental, international, and intergenerational dimensions. This framework can then be used to examine how states and organizations understand the social pillar and its environ-mental links. © 2012 Murphy.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862507324

The paper focuses on the first official Italian Public Pilot Project, dealing with the implementation of BIM-based validation and construction optimisation in a construction process. The case study concerns a residential building located in a dense urban district, causing a confined construction site affected by space shortage and coordination issues. The research aims to implement an interoperable IFC-based process in order to support the design and construction phases, performing advanced Model and Code Checking and analysing the construction phase through 4D BIM. Architectural, structural, and MEP models have been enriched with alphanumeric attributes as required by semi-automatic validation processes. An auto-matching between BIM objects and construction activities was also achieved. The early results showed the possibility of a BIM-based semi-automatic validation of design choices and an improved coordination between design disciplines. Moreover, the construction site simulation allowed the comparison of different layout options and baseline schedules. The research also tested the joint use of Model Checking and 4D BIM tools in order to analyse construction progresses by exporting an IFC-based construction site configuration directly from the 4D BIM tool. The tested process created an open, interoperable, and multi-disciplinary approach. The main findings concerning the domestic special constraints are described and analysed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963631556

In facts these ones make their overall integration more difficult and impose serious constraints on design creativity, while they do not help design considered as 'the ability to choose from different solutions'. It is generally recognized that the solution of the problem lies in efficient forms of collaboration among all the actors involved in a project. However none of the forms and tools proposed hitherto has been found satisfactory. The essay shows how the essential basis of all forms of collaboration lie in the representation and management of the knowledge activated along the design process. It subsequently illustrates an innovative distributed Knowledge-based system that allows effective and creative collaboration among the actors. By virtue of the interoperability established among the various semantic universes it enhances the level and the quality of the exchanged information among the actors while managing not to change their operating modes.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751662503

Several are the advantages provided by a reliable approach in this field, among which we cite efficient project performance control and quality control, timely on-site inspections, better control of health and safety prescriptions against job injuries and fatalities, which are still too high. This paper addresses the development of a semi-automated approach for construction management, based on two main features: on one side a project management oriented re-organization of project's information based on interoperable BIM (Building Information Modeling) and 4D modeling protocols, which aims to facilitate the control at the execution phase; on the other side a monitoring platform for real-time collection of data, relative to work progress and resources usage, by means of low intrusive technologies. Preliminary experiments on the capability by the low intrusive and real-time monitoring system to acquire and filter the data collected on resources usage are carried out. In addition, a general framework implementing several high-level logics is proposed. Its application would lead to seamless production of reports, to a semi-automated control of materials procurement, that is to say with limited or no human intervention. Preliminary application cases are shown, too. Among the expected benefits, not only economic savings for builders, but also better quality of recorded data and real-time availability of information have been pointed out.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863763853
