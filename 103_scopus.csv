More than ever, the construction industry is concerned with improving the social, economic and environmental indicators of sustainability. By applying LCA it is possible to optimise these aspects, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal of waste building materials. Firstly, this review details LCA concepts and focuses on the LCA methodology and tools employed in the built environment. Secondly, this paper outlines and discusses the differences between the LCA of building materials and components combinations versus the LCA of the full building life cycle. Finally, this work can be used by stakeholders as an important reference on LCA including up to date literature on approaches and methodologies to preserve the environment and therefore achieve sustainable development in both developed and developing countries. The present review has tried to compile and reflect the key milestones accomplished in LCA over the last 7 years, from 2000 to 2007 within the building sector. In summary, it can be stated that the application of LCA is fundamental to sustainability and improvement in building and construction. For industrial activities, SMEs must understand the application of LCA, not only to meet consumer demands for environmentally friendly products, but also to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the green construction markets. For this reason, this review looks at LCA because of its broad international acceptance as a means to improve environmental processes and services, and also for creating goals to prevent adverse environmental impacts, consequently enhancing quality of life and allowing people to live in a healthy environment. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas LCA developed from merely energy analysis to a comprehensive environmental burden analysis in the 1970s, full-fledged life cycle impact assessment and life cycle costing models were introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, and social-LCA and particularly consequential LCA gained ground in the first decade of the 21st century. Many of the more recent developments were initiated to broaden traditional environmental LCA to a more comprehensive Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA). Recently, a framework for LCSA was suggested linking life cycle sustainability questions to knowledge needed for addressing them, identifying available knowledge and related models, knowledge gaps, and defining research programs to fill these gaps. LCA is evolving into LCSA, which is a transdisciplinary integration framework of models rather than a model in itself. LCSA works with a plethora of disciplinary models and guides selecting the proper ones, given a specific sustainability question. Structuring, selecting, and making the plethora of disciplinary models practically available in relation to different types of life cycle sustainability questions is the main challenge. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650701838

However, designers are faced with many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result, designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements, and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A multi-building residential development is used as a case study for introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant reductions in embodied carbon footprint. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870828103

Life-cycle assessment (LCA), which evaluates the impacts from all life-cycle phases, from ""cradle to grave,"" is the best method to achieve this goal. In this paper, LCA is used to quantify the energy use and the environmental emissions during the construction phase of two typical office buildings, one with a structural steel frame and one with a cast-in-place concrete frame, and then these are put in the perspective of the overall service life of each building. The concrete structural-frame construction has more associated energy use, CO2, CO, NO2, particulate matter, SO2, and hydrocarbon emissions due to more formwork used, larger transportation impacts due to a larger mass of materials, and longer equipment use due to the longer installation process. In contrast, the steel-frame construction has more volatile organic compound (VOC) and heavy metal (Cr, Ni, Mn) emissions due to the painting, torch cutting, and welding of the steel members. The energy use and the environmental emissions of the two buildings are comparable if the total impacts from materials' manufacturing, construction, transportation, use, maintenance, and demolition are considered. Energy use and environmental emissions from office buildings can be reduced through a careful selection of embedded and temporary materials and construction equipment.

AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail.

The proposed ontological approach can help engineers to find work items with greater ease and consistency. Suggestions are also made for further research on ways of improving the accuracy of BIM-based quantity take-off, and developing a methodology to match between work items which are expressed as different terms; however, the proposed approach emphasizes the automation of searches using BIM data to find items suitable for building elements and materials. To enable automated inference, this study establishes (1) a work condition ontology that consists of the determinants required to select work items, (2) a work item ontology, which consists of the factors defining the tiling method, and (3) semantic reasoning rules. By conducting a case study to demonstrate the proposed ontological inference process in a real-world situation, we confirm that the proposed process can provide consistent results; however, since work items differ depending on construction type and technological advancement, the work item ontology should be continually revised and updated. The ontological inference process removes the need for the intervention of a cost estimator's subjectivity in searching for an appropriate work item.

A reference structure composed of central core (made of reinforced concrete) and rigid frames (made of either reinforced concrete or steel) is considered. The reference structure is dimensioned and detailed for buildings from 20 to 70 stories; the embodied energy of each building is then estimated (total, of the components, per net rentable area). The results show that, if some design decisions are dictated by the embodied energy, the premium for height of the embodied energy is not substantial, which proves that tall building structures can be sustainable. However, a structure with the lowest weight does not imply the lowest embodied energy. The results also prove that the embodied energy depends mainly on the flooring system, and that steel consumes more embodied energy than Reinforced Concrete. Ultimately, the embodied energy is confirmed to be a viable tool to design sustainable tall buildings, and the results presented herein may address design toward minimizing the embodied energy, which means to save environmental resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887036085

The integration of BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However, this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web data format.

In order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong.

Architects and structural engineers extensively perform designs of buildings with steel and reinforced concrete-materials that, to different degrees, are energy intensive. This presents an opportunity to use structural optimization techniques, which have traditionally been employed to minimize the total cost or total weight of a structure, to minimize the embodied energy. With this in mind, an analysis is carried out to determine the implications, from the point of view of cost, of optimizing a simple reinforced concrete structural member, in this case a rectangular beam of fixed moment and shear strengths, such that embodied energy is minimized.

For years, energy analysis tools have been used by designers to design energyefficient buildings. Generally, the energy analysis for this type of facilities is mostly conducted at the end of the design stage, once their components and elements have already been selected. However, analyzing the energy consumption of those components at the conceptual design stage is very helpful for designers when making decisions related to the selection of the most suitable design alternative that will lead to an energy-efficient building. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has the capability to help users assess different design alternatives and select vital energy strategies and systems at the conceptual design stage of proposed projects. Furthermore, by using BIM tools, designers are able to select the right type of materials early during the design stage and to make energy-related decisions that have great impact on the whole building life cycle. The main objective of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology that links BIM and energy analysis tools with green building certification systems. This methodology will be applied at the early design stage of a project's life. It will help designers measure and identify potential loss or gain of energy for different design alternatives and calculate the potential LEED points they may accumulate and gain and accordingly select the best one.

BIM presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions. Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling framework combining these three indicators in providing sustainability assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A prototype system is implemented using .NET and linked to the BIM enabled software, Revit Structures™. The system appraises alternative design solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the utilized information modelling representations - in the form of a process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations - can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at the early stages of the structural design process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in order to meet the 80% target it is necessary to reduce the carbon emitted during the whole life-cycle of buildings, including that emitted during the processes of construction. These elements make up the ‘embodied carbon’ of the building. While there are no regulations yet in place to restrict embodied carbon, a number of different approaches have been made. There are several existing databases of embodied carbon and embodied energy. Most provide data for the material extraction and manufacturing only, the ‘cradle to factory gate’ phase.

That contribution also includes the energy embodied in structures; that is, the energy consumed in the processes of extracting, manufacturing, transporting, and installing construction materials (including recycled materials) and elements. In particular, in spite of the use of additives such as fly ash, reinforced concrete (RC) structures, which are large consumers of cement, are responsible for a sizable proportion of worldwide carbon emissions. These emissions can be reduced significantly through the more efficient use of both concrete and steel that can be achieved by optimization. Modern optimization tools are now available that make it possible to perform large volumes of calculations efficiently that are applicable to a wide variety of structural engineering problems. This study presents an optimization approach developed with a view to allowing decision makers to balance sustainability and economic objectives. To illustrate this approach, an RC frame under gravity and lateral loads is considered in this paper. It was found that, depending upon the parameter values used in the calculations, the design optimized with respect to the CO2 footprint yields a CO2 footprint that is lower (by 5% to 10%) than the design optimized with respect to cost. The reduction can be smaller for low-rise structures and other structures with predominantly tension-controlled members. However, for structures whose members predominantly experience large compressive forces, such as high-rise buildings, the reduction may be more significant.

However, there is a lack of information on the aspect of sustainability related to construction, which is one of the largest users of energy, material resources, and water, and is responsible for a very significant portion of pollution by harmful and damaging emissions and wastes. Comprehensive review of sustainable materials in the construction industry is carried out to identify the sustainable criteria related to the structural materials based on life-cycle thinking. This criterion is utilized to develop a sustainable scoring system (SSS), which is intended to be a reasonable way to assess the structural material sustainability from extraction to demolition and linked to the design of the structural element.

Many green building rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices), design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed.

In recent years, the percentage of embodied carbon dioxide in the whole life cycle impact of buildings has been increasing while innovations have lowered operational carbon dioxide. Operational carbon dioxide emissions are due to heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting, whereas embodied carbon dioxide is associated with materials extraction, manufacturing, transportation, construction, maintenance and demolition. Limited research on the latter prevents an accurate evaluation of the whole life cycle impact of buildings. Therefore, leading engineers have emphasised the urgent need for a global, standard assessment method for embodied carbon dioxide. To this end, this paper offers a uniform method by describing current work, quantifying material weights and finally calculating embodied carbon dioxide ranges. The approach is cradle-to-gate but can be expanded to cradle-to-grave. The survey contains data on 200 recently completed buildings obtained from industry. The results show that structural material quantities vary between 200 kg/m2 and 1800 kg/m2 and embodied carbon dioxide caries on the range 150-600 kgCO2e/m2.

The framework was applied to a 40-storey residential building in Hong Kong for estimating the potential of natural ventilation in residential high-rise buildings. The results show that the building can save up to 25% of the electricity consumption if the building employs wind-driven natural ventilation instead of mechanical ventilation.

The contribution of the building industry to a wide range of environmental impacts is extensive with the construction, operation and maintenance of buildings accounting for approximately 50% of all energy usage and anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. In the building design process, structural engineers play a limited role in the sustainability of a design. The decisions on the incorporation of such aspects are usually at the mercy of the architect and client. A literature review was conducted to record and present the variability in research on issues directly related to the environmental performance of structures. There are inconsistencies in the published contribution of embodied energy (EE) and proportion of life cycle energy usage in structures. Outcomes demonstrate that due to this variability, environmental performance of structures is difficult to validate. A systematic approach beginning with standardized calculation procedure and database generation for EE of building materials is essential for practitioners to deliver sustainable structural designs. An analysis of a typical concrete office structure indicates potential benefits through the use of quantifiable environmental performance measures, delivering efficient solutions. Comparisons of slab construction techniques indicate overall EE reductions up to 40% being achievable. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the optimization of individual structural elements and the topological arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material cost are both reduced by 18–24% after performing optimization. The proposed approach can be extended to optimize other types of buildings (such as steel framework) with a similar problem nature, thereby improving the cost efficiency and environmental sustainability of the built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068671653

However, fast evaluation of various design options and identification of the optimized design requires application of design analysis tools such as energy modeling, daylight simulations, and natural ventilation analysis software. Energy analysis requires access to distributed sources of information such as building element material properties provided by designers, mechanical equipment information provided by equipment manufacturers, weather data provided by weather reporting agencies, and energy cost data from energy providers. Gathering energy related information from different sources and inputting the information to an energy analysis application is a time consuming process. This causes delays and increases the time for comparing different design alternatives. This paper discusses how Semantic Web technology can facilitate information collection from several sources for energy analysis. Semantic Web enables sharing, accessing, and combining information over the Internet in a machine process-able format. This would free building designers to concentrate on building design optimization rather than spending time on data preparation and manual entry into energy analysis applications. © 2015 The Authors.

However, the current approach often fails to consider the multi-perspectives of structural design, such as safety, environmental issues and cost in a comprehensive way. This paper presents a holistic approach based on knowledge processing (ontology) to facilitate a smarter decision-making process for early design stage by informing designers of the environmental impact and cost along with safety considerations. The approach can give a reasoning based quantitative understanding of how the design alternatives using different concrete materials can affect the ultimate overall performance. Embodied CO2 and cost are both considered along with safety criteria as indicative multi-perspectives to demonstrate the novelty of the approach. A case study of a concrete structural frame is used to explain how the proposed method can be used by structural designers when taking multi performance criteria into account. The major contribution of the paper lies on the creation of a holistic knowledge base which links through different knowledge across sectors to enable the structural engineer to come up with much more comprehensive decisions instead of individual single objective targeted delivery. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028061089

The main objective of this research is to explore and to develop a holistic and integrated methodology that utilises Building Information Modelling's (BIM) capabilities combined with structural analysis and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as well as a two-staged structural optimisation solver that achieves efficient and environmentally responsible steel design solutions. The implemented workflow utilises Autodesk Revit-BIM, Tally-LCA and Autodesk Robot-Structural Analysis. RobOpt is the plug-in that has been established using the Application Programming Interface (API) of Robot and the .NET framework of C?, and it inherits several structural functionalities based on Robot Finite Element Method (FEM) engine. The proposed RobOpt application can be accessed via a graphic user interface (GUI) within the Robot software. The developed BIM-enabled optimisation methodology could be utilised as a design tool to inform early stage structural design solutions. A prototypical steel framed structural system under certain loads has been explored. The resulting bespoke I-beam sections from the custom genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation demonstrate that significant savings-up to 21%-can be achieved in all tested environmental indicators when compared to the standard UK catalogue of steel sections.

They also have different requirements for accuracy, verisimilitude, and rendering performance. These various organizations have different standards and business processes for which they have developed their own paper and digital delivery procedures. To solve these problems, The National BIM standard (NBIMS) establishes standard definitions for building information exchanges to support critical business contexts using standard semantics and ontologies. This Standard forms the foundation for accurate and efficient communication and commerce that are needed by the construction industry. This paper investigates the general objectives of this standard, its relationship to structural engineering practice and focuses on the importance of involvement and contribution of structural engineering community to this standard. The standard is still in its infancy and the evolution and maturity of NBIMS will help to establish advanced design, communication and simulation tools that give the structural engineering community an opportunity to change the way it works in the industry, including open collaboration between stakeholders, design for optimum structure, increased energy efficiency, flexibility, constructability, comfort, and sustainability. It is important to note that agencies in the government and private sectors are currently adopting and enforcing the NBIM standard and it is becoming critical that the structural engineering community understands and delivers projects consistent with these NBIMS standards. © 2010 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053145623

Although the structural impacts for most buildings in the United States and Canada are relatively small compared to the operational energy use impacts, in areas where electricity sources are predominantly from renewable sources and in energy efficient buildings the relative impact of the structural systems becomes very important. The structural system can account for more than one-third of the material use and waste generation and more than 10% of the energy use and greenhouse gas production over a building lifespan of 50 years. In absolute terms, the greenhouse emissions caused by building structural systems in the United States is equivalent to the greenhouse emissions caused by 22 million new cars driven 19,000 km per year.

In this paper, we show that building neural networks allows one to train a surrogate model to accelerate the structural performance assessment of various possible structural forms without going through a significantly slower process of geometric form-finding. The geometric form-finding methods of 3D graphic statics are used as the primary structural design tool to generate a single-layer, compression-only shell with planar faces. Subdividing the force diagram and its polyhedral cells using various rules results in a variety of topologically different compression-only structures with different load-bearing capacities for the same boundary conditions. The solution space for all possible compression-only forms for a given boundary condition is vast, which makes iterating through all forms to find the ideal solutions practically impossible. After training with an iterative active sampling method, the surrogate model can evaluate the input data, including the subdivision rules, and predict the value of the structural performance and the construction constraints of the planar faces within milliseconds. As a result, one can then evaluate the nonlinear relations among all the subdivision rules and the chosen structural performance measures, and then, visualize the entire solution space. Consequently, multiple solutions with customized thresholds of the evaluation criteria are found that show the strength of this method of form-finding in generating design solutions. Besides, considering the total training time of the neural network model, the proposed framework is still faster than a traditional optimization method, such as the genetic algorithm that can find only the optimum values. This process will result in interactive sampling methods in which the machine learning models assist the designer in choosing and controlling different design strategies by providing real-time feedback on the effects of the selected parameters on the design outputs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087680334

It was concluded that the points related to the structural credits are roughly proportional to the cost of structural elements in buildings. However, participation of structural engineers in the sustainability efforts is disproportionally low based on the percentage of structural engineers holding LEED Accredited Professionals (LEED AP) designation. Embodied and total energy requirements of typical buildings were examined and it was concluded that embodied energy in the structural components has a share ranging from 2% for traditional buildings to 25% for net-zero buildings. Finally, the sustainability aspects related to structural design that are currently ignored in the rating systems were identified and discussed. Such aspects include: baseline material usage, structural robustness and resilience to disasters, structural adaptability and reuse, structural durability and longevity. It was emphasised that a structure can be sustainable, in true spirit of the terminology, without achieving significant points in the rating systems as long it satisfies the guiding principle of reducing burden on natural resources and the environment. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886234349
