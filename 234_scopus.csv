The main network of the recognition method consists of 5 convolution layers, 5 max-pooling layers and 2 full connection layers. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the network, we design two sub-networks, namely, spatial attention model and channel attention model, to enhance the feature representation ability and regional sensitivity of the main network. It is achieved by making both the channel weights and spatial weights of the main network's feature maps learnable. Moreover, random crop, flipping, color jitter, affine transformation and data balance operations are jointly utilized to increase the diversity of training data and improve data imbalance. Extensive experimental results on the collected real dataset show that the proposed method can achieve the accuracy rate of 94.9%, which is 4.9% higher than common recognition methods. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Railway Science.
