The main purpose of this study is to identify the delay factors and their impact (effect) on project completion. Earlier studies either considered the causes or the effects of project delays, separately. This study takes an integrated approach and attempts to analyze the impact of specific causes on specific effects. A questionnaire survey was conducted to solicit the causes and effects of delay from clients, consultants, and contractors. About 150 respondents participated in the survey. This study identified 10 most important causes of delay from a list of 28 different causes and 6 different effects of delay. Ten most important causes were: (1) contractor's improper planning, (2) contractor's poor site management, (3) inadequate contractor experience, (4) inadequate client's finance and payments for completed work, (5) problems with subcontractors, (6) shortage in material, (7) labor supply, (8) equipment availability and failure, (9) lack of communication between parties, and (10) mistakes during the construction stage. Six main effects of delay were: (1) time overrun, (2) cost overrun, (3) disputes, (4) arbitration, (5) litigation, and (6) total abandonment.

This paper presents results from the first statistically significant study of cost performance in transport infrastructure projects. The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 258 projects in 20 nations worth approximately US$90 billion (constant 1995 prices). The paper shows with overwhelming statistical significance that in terms of costs transport infrastructure projects do not perform as promised. The conclusion is tested for different project types, different geographical regions and different historical periods. Substantial cost escalation is the rule rather than the exception. For rail, average cost escalation is 45% (SD = 38), for fixed links (tunnels and bridges) it is 34% (62) and for roads 20% (30). Cost escalation appears a global phenomenon, existing across 20 nations on five continents. Cost estimates have not improved and cost escalation not decreased over the past 70 years. Cost estimates used in decision-making for transport infrastructure development are highly, systematically and significantly misleading. Large cost escalations combined with large standard deviations translate into large financial risks. However, such risks are typically ignored or underplayed in decision-making, to the detriment of social and economic welfare.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037242979

Thus, it is essential to define the most significant causes of delay in order to avoid or minimise their impact on construction projects. A detailed questionnaire was developed and used to get input from professionals associated with the UAE construction industry. The perspective of contractors and consultants has been analysed to rank the causes of delays based on their Relative Importance Index.

This means that much of the national budget on infrastructure development is channelled to road construction projects. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to identify causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. Using a detailed literature review, structured interviews and questionnaire surveys, the results of the study confirmed the prevalence of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia. The study established that bad or inclement weather due to heavy rains and floods, scope changes, environmental protection and mitigation costs, schedule delay, strikes, technical challenges, inflation and local government pressures were the major causes of cost escalation in Zambia's road construction projects. On the other hand, delayed payments, financial processes and difficulties on the part of contractors and clients, contract modification, economic problems, materials procurement, changes in drawings, staffing problems, equipment unavailability, poor supervision, construction mistakes, poor coordination on site, changes in specifications and labour disputes and strikes were found to be the major causes of schedule delays in road construction projects.

Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability of resources, and ""map"" of the respective supply chains visually. A case example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the developed system.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872313658

A total of 120 questionnaires were distributed to 3 key groups of project participants; namely owners, consultants and contractors. The survey findings indicate that all 3 groups agree that the most important factors affecting project performance are: delays because of borders/roads closure leading to materials shortage; unavailability of resources; low level of project leadership skills; escalation of material prices; unavailability of highly experienced and qualified personnel; and poor quality of available equipment and raw materials. Based on these findings, the paper recommends that: 1) project owners must work collaboratively with contractors and facilitate regular payments in order to overcome delays, disputes and claims; 2) project participants should actively have their input in the process of decision-making; and 3) continuous coordination and relationship between project participants are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349589625

Is China's economic growth a consequence of its purposeful investment? Is China a prodigy in delivering infrastructure from which rich democracies could learn? The prevalent view in economics literature and policies derived from it is that a high level of infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is especially held up as a model to emulate. Politicians in rich democracies display awe and envy of the scale of infrastructure Chinese leaders are able to build. Based on the largest dataset of its kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that (i) infrastructure creates economic value, and that (ii) China has a distinct advantage in its delivery. Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure investment fails to deliver a positive risk-adjusted return. Moreover, China's track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich democracies. Investing in unproductive projects results initially in a boom, as long as construction is ongoing, followed by a bust, when forecasted benefits fail to materialize and projects therefore become a drag on the economy. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive projects results in the build-up of debt, monetary expansion, instability in financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy. China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other countries but one to avoid. © The Authors 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982111846

One of the critical problems concerning these projects is the frequent and lengthy delays that occur. In order to improve the situation, it is first necessary to identify the major causes involved. Several studies have already been reported which do this but all use different sets of variables. Also, none has attempted to identify the extent to which improvements are possible in practice. A new survey is reported that uses all the variables from the previous work and measures for both current degree of effect on delays and the extent to which each can be practically improved. These are contained in seven groupings: client, contractor, consultant, materials, labour, contract and relationship-related causes. The survey covers a sample of 86 clients, contractors and consultants working in the Saudi construction industry. The analysis reveals some considerable heterogeneity between the cause groupings and respondent groupings in terms of means and correlations, apparently partly due to lack of knowledge of respondents and a tendency for the consultants to blame the contractors for the delays and vice versa. The main results, therefore, are disaggregated to reflect the views of each respondent group concerning each group of causes. In general however, it is found that the most influencing current cause of delay is the lack of qualified and experienced personnel-attributed to the considerable amount of large, innovative, construction projects and associated current undersupply of manpower in the industry.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-61649124532

The purpose of this paper is to assess factors leading to time overruns (delays) and cost overruns in construction projects in the Gaza Strip. Since there appear to be additional special contributors to delays here, the relative perceptions of contractors, consultants and owners are compared, based on a listing of causal factors derived from previous studies elsewhere, together with other factors arising from special conditions in the Gaza Strip. Design/methodology/approach A survey of a randomly selected samples yielded responses from 66 contractors, 27 consultants, and 31 owners. The survey included 110 delay factors/causes which were grouped into 12 major groups. The same survey also included 42 cost overrun factors. The level of importance of the delays and cost overrun factors were measured and ranked by their importance indexes, according to the perspectives of contractors, consultants, and owners. Findings There seems to be a general agreement between contractors, consultants and owners regarding causes of delays and cost overruns. The main four causes of time delays included strikes and border closures, materialrelated factors, lack of materials in markets, and delays in materials delivery to the site. Additionally, the main three causes for cost overruns included price fluctuations of construction materials, contractor delays in material and equipment delivery, and inflation. Originality/value The outcome of this paper will assist owners, contractors, and consultants in understanding the reasons for delays and cost overruns, thus eliminating or minimizing these causes. This could be achieved by better management of the projects and by finding new methods for storing the critical materials from the beginning of the project. Furthermore, the local government is advised to initiate legislation to overcome problems arising from monopolies in the supply of construction materials. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992960790

Statistical analysis of responses on the attributes segregated them into distinct sets of success attributes and failure attributes. Factor analysis of sets of success attributes and failure attributes separately grouped them into six critical success factors and seven critical failure factors. In order to understand the extent of contribution these factors have on the outcome of a construction project, a second stage questionnaire survey was also undertaken. The analyses of responses of the second stage questionnaire led us to conclude that two success factors and one failure factor: commitment of project participants; owner's competence; and conflict among project participants contribute significantly in enhancement of current performance level of the project. The extent of their contribution has, however, been observed to vary for a given level of project performance.

Therefore, it is essential to study and analyze causes of road construction delays. This paper studied a list of construction delay causes gathered from literature having different types of construction, different countries, different periods and different numbers of delay causes and delay groups. A questionnaire and personal interviews have formed the basis of this paper listing 293 delay causes. The questionnaire survey was distributed to 500 construction participants and 389 were received who represent consultants, contractors and site/design engineers excluding the owner representing the government in road projects as one party only. Relative Importance Index (RII) is calculated and according to the highest values the top twenty and the least twenty delay causes of construction projects in Egypt are determined. A case study is analyzed and compared to the most important delay causes in the paper. The test results reveal good correlation of causes and groups between contractors and site/design engineers and between consultants and site design engineers and a somewhat low correlation between contractors and consultants. So there are no root causes that can be taking for granted to be most or least effective delay causes. Proposed model for predicting actual road construction project duration was developed; a real case study tested the accuracy of proposed model. According to the analysis of case study, the most contributing causes and groups to delays were discussed, and some future recommendations were proposed in order to control and minimize delays in road construction projects. These findings can be helpful for project managers to mitigate the road construction delays in Egypt. In order to effectively overcome the road construction delays in developing countries, suggestions are made for fundamental and large?scale reforms in procurement systems and stakeholders' management. Also, this paper is useful for both researchers and road construction parties and allows detailed and repeatable analysis of the progress of a road construction project in order to facilitate and achieve a competitive level of time, cost and quality for effective road construction projects. © 2016 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962129231

A theoretical structural equation model representing the influence of four key latent variables on project delays in the Indian construction industry has been developed. Data collected from a questionnaire survey and personal interviews, with 77 valid responses from clients, contractors and designers or architects, were used to further formulate and analyse the model. The results of the structural equation model suggest that client's influence is one of the most significant factors affecting time performance on Indian projects. Client's influence is also found to be one of the key contributing factors resulting in lack of commitment and contractor's inefficiency in the project. Lack of efficient construction planning plays the second key role in adverse time performance. While the effect of lack of commitment on contractor's inefficiency is highly significant, neither of these two factors has any direct impact on time delay in projects. Contrary to the notion that the contractor is the only party responsible for delay in construction projects, the results clearly highlight the importance of the role of clients and technical expertise in planning in achieving satisfactory time performance on Indian projects.

It can be argued that the problem is likely to be more pronounced in areas where development pressure is the highest. One such area is the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the construction industry is said to have reached an unparalleled position in the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most significant causes of delays in the UAE construction industry. Design/methodology/approach -A survey was conducted targeting three key types of stakeholders, namely clients, contractors and consultants. Validity and reliability were achieved by first assessing the plausibility of construction delay variables in UAE. The verification took place after the interpretation of quantitative data, this involved presenting the findings to the main participants. The validation took place after the verification process. Rigour was achieved by engaging participants previously engaged in UAE and focussing on verification and validation, this included responsiveness of the researchers during group discussions, methodological coherence, appropriate sampling frame and data analysis. Findings -From the analysis, the study unveiled a number of important causes of construction delays in the UAE, ranging from unrealistic contract durations to poor labour productivity, with consultants and clients seemingly shouldering the bulk of the ""blame game"". It was evident that all the three main stakeholders in a construction project (clients, consultants and contractors) need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. The research also confirms that delays are country specific and appear to be time related hence they should be viewed within the social, economic and cultural settings of the UAE. Research limitations/implications -A major limitation of the current study was the use of a single approach to facilitate data collection. Practical implications -It was evident that practitioners need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. Continuous coordination and relationship between practitioners are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance. Originality/value -As suggested in this study methods should be put in place to reduce long and bureaucratic processes within the client's organisations, not only to fulfil the requirements of the contract but also to suite fast-track projects.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016022127

However, two external factors, rain and flood, were the first two factors on the list, which also had a high impact on the three project objectives. The remaining factors on the list were land acquisition, award of project to lowest bidder, equipment breakdowns, poor site arrangement, management and supervision, unexpected ground condition and terrain, low quality of the contractor human resources, late progress payments, and low productivity of labor.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the universal delay factors from an intensive literature review, complemented by delay factors in major Norwegian construction projects based on empirical data. Design/methodology/approach: The study in which this paper is based includes an intensive literature review, and semi-quantitative open survey questionnaires. This paper addresses frequency and type of delay factors in construction projects, in Norway based on the survey, and worldwide based on the previous studies. Findings: From the study, the causes of delays facing the Norwegian construction industry are: poor planning and scheduling; slow/poor decision-making process; internal administrative procedures and bureaucracy within project organisations; resources shortage (human resources, machinery, equipment); poor communication and coordination between parties; slow quality inspection process of the completed work; design changes during construction/change orders; sponsor/owner/client lack of commitment and/or clear demands (goals and objectives); late/slow/incomplete/improper design; office issues; and users’ issues. And the top 10 universal delay factors are: design changes during construction/change orders; delays in payment of contractor(s); poor planning and scheduling; poor site management and supervision; incomplete or improper design; inadequate contractor experience/building methods and approaches; contractor’s financial difficulties; sponsor/owner/client’s financial difficulties; resources shortage (human resources, machinery, equipment); and poor labour productivity and shortage of skills. Research limitations/implications: When it comes to the identification of delay factors in major Norwegian projects, the research is based on a sample of 202 respondents from an open survey questionnaire. It should be noted that analysing a large population of respondents that have been asked open questions can be challenging due to the vague findings it might lead to. Also, when it comes to the identification of the universal delay factors, there were different methods used by different authors, within different context. Similar future studies in Norway based on qualitative and quantitative methods will give better verification for the findings. Practical implications: This paper has documented the critical delay factors/causes in Norway. The results of this study will help project managers, in Norway and elsewhere, to be aware and know about the potential causes of delay in their construction projects, which will help to identify the possible risks in the early phases of the project. Another practical implication is to make project managers and policy makers conscious that delays are quite universal, making it necessary to identify them as a first step. Social implications: The identification of delays factors and causes can permit projects to implement mitigation actions to avoid delays, thus allowing delivering schools, hospitals and other necessary infrastructure on schedule or ahead of schedule to society. Originality/value: This paper highlights most (almost all) of the studies in the literature, including to the study done in Norway, concerning the delay factors in construction projects and large construction projects in general. This wide review of relevant literature will save time other academicians from having to conduct similar studies. This study will assist both academic and professional experts providing more insight about the delay causes in large-scale construction projects. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045842637

K is a constant characteristic of building time performance, and B is a constant indicative of the sensitivity of time performance to cost level. The aim of this paper is to identify whether such time-cost relationship can be extended to the building projects in Malaysia. Time and cost data from 51 public sector projects were collected to verify whether such a relationship holds in the Malaysian building industry. Regression analysis was used to compute the values of K, B and check how well the model actually fits. Analysis of these 51 projects identified that the best predictor of average construction time of public sector projects in Malaysia is T= 269C0.32.

The main objective of this paper is to identify the causes of design changes and the implications on the Malaysian construction projects measured in terms of cost and time. It also aims to determine how rework induced from the design changes is detrimental to project performance and to suggest recommendations on how to overcome the related problem with project learning and effective communication in building construction. To investigate the factors giving rise to design changes, a total of 43 causes were first identified through a comprehensive literature review. The factors are categorised into client, consultant, contractor, site and external-related themes. This is followed by a qualitative research study involving semi-structured interviews with 12 experienced industry practitioners comprising of clients, consultants, and contractors. Critical incident technique employing content analysis is used to analyse the interviews transcripts in detail to provide a rich picture of the causes of design changes, the implications for project delivery performance, enablers of effective communication, enablers of project learning and types of reusable project knowledge. The research findings were further integrated to develop a collaborative model to manage design changes using effective communication and project learning approach. This model highlights the importance of effective communication and project learning towards improving the level of competency and cohesiveness of project team in managing future projects.

The risk is assumed as a deviation from the desired level. It can be positive or, which most often happens, it can be negative. Therefore, the risks analysis is so important for project selection and coordination of construction work. The risk analysis is regarded as the analysis of adverse events even at the stage of planning and programming of a construction project. This analysis enriches the decision-making process and provides additional arguments, which help to select the optimal variant of a construction project using the Multi-Aspects approach. This article presents three different methods of the risk analysis as well as highlighting their disadvantages, advantages and primary areas of application (selection or pre-estimation). These methods differ in their methodology from each other. The verification was started from the simplest techniques using some qualitative variables. This method is based on the considerable subjectivity of a decision maker although it is relatively simple and easy to use.

Working in these regions poses unique challenges that lead to unconventional causes for construction delay. As such, this research aims to (1) develop a better understanding of the causes of delays that may be encountered in countries with high geopolitical risks, (2) gauge the relative impact these delay causes are expected to have on project completion, and (3) capture how delay causes are influenced by project and country characteristics. Research findings are based on two distinct data sources: quantitative and qualitative data. First, a window delay analysis is conducted of six project schedules and narratives with extensive quantitative data informed of the probability and impact of various delay causes in countries with high geopolitical risks. This quantitative source was then complemented with qualitative data based on interviewing 18 experts who were involved in 36 projects, which spanned 16 countries with high geopolitical risks. Results of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis were merged to create an integrated delay cause database. This merging helps to leverage the advantages of both approaches, i.e., accuracy of data and breadth of coverage, and enables construction companies to better anticipate the future causes of delay on their international construction projects. For an upcoming project in a country with high geopolitical risk, the database can be used to suggest or predict the most likely causes of delay based on matching the similarity (location and project type) with existing cases. Comparison of results with the literature on construction delay causes in developing countries suggests that there are several delay causes that are unique, and also substantial, in countries with high geopolitical risks. The benefits of this research are broad. The capacity to predict delay causes in future projects in which geopolitical risks are detectable can result in (1) the development of more effective risk response plans, (2) more reliable estimation of contingencies, and (3) establishment of more efficient project control procedures. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010440553

In this respect, some Beninese construction experts have been interviewed about some construction projects: departmental hospital, administration office, school, community health care center and community market done in the past and located in Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Abomey and Parakou. After statistical data of frequency, severity and importance was analyzed, an index of thirty-five delay factors were identified and used in structured questionnaires that were sent to the construction managers (contractor, owner, consultant and architect). The top ten important delay factors by their rank were further identified as: Financial capability by contractor, financial difficulties by owner, poor subcontractor performance, materials procurement of contractor, changes in drawings of architect, inadequate planning and scheduling of contractor, slow inspection of completed works by the consultant, equipment availability of contractor, preparation, approval of drawings of consultant and acceptance of inadequate design drawings by consultant. A comparison of the top five delay factors of Benin construction projects requiring a time extension with selected construction projects in Asia and other African countries shows that financial difficulty is most common, especially in African countries. Other causes of delay are very similar for developing countries and related to lack of technology, management, skills and competencies of project participants.

Investigating Iran, a developing Middle Eastern country, this paper focuses on the reasons for construction project delays. We conducted several interviews with owners, contractors, consultants, industry experts and regulatory bodies to accurately ascertain specific delay factors. Based on the results of our industry surveys, a statistical model was developed to quantitatively determine each delay factor's importance in construction project management. The statistical model categorises the delay factors under four major classes and determines the most significant delay factors in each class: owner defects, contractor defects, consultant defects and law, regulation and other general defects. The most significant delay factors in the owner defects category are lack of attention to inflation and inefficient budgeting schedule. In the contractor defects category, the most significant delay factors are inaccurate budgeting and resource planning, weak cash flow and inaccurate pricing and bidding. As for the consultant defects delay factors such as inaccurate first draft and inaccuracies in technical documents have the most contribution to the defects. On the other hand, outdated standard mandatory items in cost lists, outdated mandatory terms in contracts and weak governmental budgeting are the most important delay factors in the law, regulation and other general defects. Moreover, regression models demonstrate that a significant difference exists between the initial and final project duration and cost. According to the models, the average delay per year is 5.9 months and the overall cost overrun is 15.4%. Our findings can be useful in at least two ways: first, resolving the root causes of particularly important delay factors would significantly streamline project performance and second, the regression models could assist project managers and companies with revising initial timelines and estimated costs. This study does not consider all types of construction projects in Iran: the scope is limited to certain types of private and publicly funded projects as will be described.

This paper explores the process of construction technology implementation, including the main activities, assessment criteria, and the mechanism through which it influences future technology purchase decisions. To achieve this purpose, 98 experienced practitioners from Australia and the United States were interviewed, and the process used by customers during technology adoption decisions was extracted in the form of thematic analysis. This paper presents an original framework including the key subprocesses of technology implementation describing the activities of customers and vendors, including operation commencement, maintenance set up, and assessment. In addition, the findings show that customers assess the implementation based on assessment criteria, including down time, interpersonal relationship, and technology operation quality. Comparison between the United States and Australia showed that rapport with the vendor is more important in large markets, whereas lead time and disposal are more important in remote markets. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by validating a framework that incorporates both customer and vendor activities into a unique framework of three subprocesses.

However, there is still a lack of attention about rework within the Malaysian construction industry. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of rework on schedule and cost performance, to explore the causes of rework and to propose effective measures to minimise the occurrence of rework in building construction projects in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 114 construction stakeholders consisting of 39 clients, 36 consultants and 39 contractors from the Klang Valley region, the authors investigated the variables on rework through a questionnaire survey. The level of importance of the causes and the potential solutions was ranked and correlated. Findings: From the primary data analysis, the study on Malaysian building projects unveiled the cost of rework to range from 3.1 to 6.0 per cent of the project value and the schedule growth due to rework to range from 5.1 to 10.0 per cent. The significant causes of rework were identified and prioritised. The 18 causes were further categorised into five underlying dimensions by using a factor analysis. Effective rework reduction measures were also given. Finally, the relationships between the causes of rework and the potential solutions were identified using correlation tests. Research limitations/implications: While this study is limited to rework in Malaysian building construction, rework in infrastructure projects is a potential area to discover new causes and possible solutions. Practical implications: This paper provides insights into the effects of rework to project outcomes, causes of rework and feasible solutions in reducing rework in building construction projects. Originality/value: Rework has been the focal point of research; however, empirical studies on rework have been under-represented in the Malaysian construction industry.

There is a need to discourage litigation arising from weather-related delays by including in contracts a reasonable number of nonwork days as a consequence of adverse weather and providing an equitable criteria for the course of action when the predictions in the contracts turn out to be inaccurate. To address this need, an integrated framework consisting of the following two key components is proposed: (1) identification of attributes of weather that cause construction delays and (2) generation of synthetic weather sequences using a stochastic weather generator to quantify and provide probabilistic forecasts of weather threshold values. The utility of this framework is demonstrated through its application to construction work on a project in Texas. The use of probabilistic forecast of construction delay attributes provided by a semiparametric weather generator in this research is an example of interdisciplinary study to help address this problem.

However, the performance of relevant algorithms on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data sets have not been comparatively evaluated, when such data sets are increasingly being used for construction purposes due to their capability of providing volumetric information of objects. This study aims to suggest appropriate building change detection algorithms based on a comparative evaluation of the performance of five selected algorithms including three pixel-based algorithms, Digital Surface Model differencing (DSMd), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML), and two point-based change detection algorithms, namely Cloud to Cloud (C2C) and Multiple Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2). The algorithms were applied on two-point cloud samples from the same areas, and the results of pixel-based change detection algorithms indicate that the SVM algorithm could operate satisfactorily when noise is present in the data but could not reliably quantify the magnitudes of building height changes. The DSMd algorithm can derive the magnitudes of building height change, but it produces a high level of noise in the result and influences the change detection reliability. Therefore, an integration of DSMd and SVM was applied to determine the magnitudes of change and significantly reduce the noise in the results. Among point-based algorithms, M3C2 algorithm is able to show the magnitudes of building height changes and differentiate between new and demolished objects, while C2C can not fully satisfy the evaluation criteria. The authors recommend evaluation of these algorithms using additional temporal data sets and in various urban areas.

This paper presents the methods of an investigation addressing the extremely complex issues related to the current practices of digital technology adoption in construction. It discusses how construction companies follow a specific logical process linked to need, project objectives, the characteristics of the adopting organization and the characteristics of the new technology to be adopted. The study aims to demonstrate a novel method of data collection and analysis, such as data and methodological triangulation techniques, including the use of NVivo and AHP to explore how companies make the decision to uptake new technology (e.g., advanced crane, tunnel boring machine or drones) by focusing on customer and vendor activities, their interactions, contributing factors and people involved in the process.

CTAP is a framework that delineates the phases of the process that customer organizations use when deciding to adopt a new digital technology and the parallel vendor activities. The significance of these contributions is that they enable vendors to understand how to match their strategies with customer expectations in each phase of CTAP.

The result revealed that poor cash flow management is the most significant factor that leads to a project's delay followed by late payment, insufficient financial resources and financial market instability. Contractors' instable financial background, client's poor financial and business management, difficulties in obtaining loan from financiers and inflation were identified as the most significant underlying causes.

However, the delivery of construction projects is often plagued by schedule delays and cost overruns due to lack of working knowledge of project personnel. Hence, the need to appraise the practices of knowledge management in the construction industry has become all the more germane. This paper aims to determine the awareness of KM practices in Malaysia-based construction small and medium enterprises, and to investigate the benefits, tools and techniques, and challenges associated with knowledge management implementation so that effective measures can be devised to address them. Design/methodology/approach: The research data were gathered using a structured questionnaire survey disseminated in the Klang Valley region in Malaysia. Responses were collected from 107 industry practitioners. The quantitative data are subjected to descriptive statistics, and the ranking with category of significance of the hypothesised variables is determined using the relative importance index (RII) technique. Findings: The key benefits of KM practices are predominantly raising efficiency, quality, productivity and decision-making. The most preferred KM techniques are “face-to-face interaction”, “mentoring” and “documents and reports”. The highly significant tools are “groupware” and “telephone”. The major organisational issue hampering the implementation of knowledge management practices is “lack of motivation” while the critical cultural issue is relating to “bureaucracy and hierarchical”, and the vital people issue concerns “lack of trust”. Research limitations/implications: The respondents were limited to only small and medium construction enterprises located in the Klang Valley region in Malaysia, which makes generalisation challenging.

The main objective of this paper is to identify and analyse the major problems which exist between the contractors and subcontractors in the construction industry in the Gaza Strip. A questionnaire was designed to elicit contractors' and subcontractors' viewpoints regarding the most important causes of problems that affect the relationship between them. A total of 53 problems were identified based on a literature review, a pilot study was considered in this study and was listed under five groups. A total of 150 questionnaires were randomly sent to contractors and subcontractors. The respondents had extensive experience in the construction industry with average working experience of 20 years. The questionnaire was validated by the criterion-related reliability test that measures the correlation coefficients between the factors selected for in each group and for all groups as one entity, and structure validity test (Spearman test). The result of the survey indicated that, assigning part of the works to new subcontractor without informing the original subcontractor, contractor's financial problems, delay in contract progress payments, non-adherence to the conditions of the contract, non-adherence of the subcontractor to the time schedule, and lack of construction quality work were the most important causes of interface problems, while involvement in several projects with the contractor at the same time, weather conditions, and geological problems on site were considered as trivial causes of potential interface problems. Spearman's rank correlation tests showed that there are no differences in the viewpoints between contractors and subcontractors. The research findings might assist practitioners to focus on major problems which have existed between the contractors and subcontractors in the construction industry in their present and future projects.

It is very important to be able to estimate the delay that would result from such severe weather because construction contracts generally differentiate between weather delays that can be anticipated and those that cannot. Only delays caused by abnormal and unforeseeable severe weather are granted a time extension. Normal and foreseeable weather delays in construction contracts are usually estimated as a monthly average of the severe weather days as determined from historical weather data, which are measured at the ground level. In high-rise building construction, however, this approach may be inappropriate because weather conditions generally vary with an increase in altitude and the height of high-rise buildings has become so great that those conditions can actually affect the construction of the upper floors. Therefore, weather delays estimated using this approach could be subject to this error. For such reasons, a simulation model capable of analyzing weather delays with consideration for altitudinal variations in the weather conditions is proposed for high-rise building construction projects. To achieve this goal, the literature addressing the types of weather variables, the threshold criteria causing weather delays, and the duration of weather delays was first reviewed. Then, a weather-generation model using a k-nearest neighbor time-series method and vertical weather profiles was developed to estimate the weather conditions at high altitudes. A simulation model was finally developed by integrating the weather generation model and a construction schedule simulation model by using a discrete event simulation method, and a case study was conducted to validate the results of weather delay estimation and to analyze the degree to which vertical weather variations affect the schedule of building construction projects. The contribution of this study is the proposal of a method based on a vertical weather profile that is capable of reasonably estimating weather delays in high-rise building constructions, and analyzing the pattern of weather delays in building construction projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969913334

However, there is no consensus on the relative severity of various causes of delay because severity may change with respect to project characteristics, such as the type of project and/or procurement type. Public-private partnership (PPP) has been utilized extensively in recent years, and the number of public construction works worldwide that adopted the PPP has increased gradually. However, the delay causes specific to PPPs have not been investigated deeply. Moreover, the perceptions of different stakeholders on causes of delay in PPP projects have never been investigated, although the perception difference between stakeholders is considered an important issue in delay management. In this study, the perceptions of three key stakeholders - namely, consultants, the private sector, and the public sector - on delay causes in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects performed in Turkey, which is one of the leading countries in terms of number of PPP projects and the total value of PPP projects, were investigated. The delay causes specific to BOT projects were evaluated by conducting a workshop to determine the causes of delay in the Turkish market. The identified delay causes were evaluated using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) by 11 participants who represent consultants, the private sector, and the public sector. The correlations between the respondents were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This study showed that the most important delay causes are related to the uncertainties and changes. In particular, private sector participants emphasized the importance of certainty on political and governmental issues and minimization of changes in design to avoid delays in BOT projects.

This paper aims to empirically examine the influence of project communication management and project learning as preventive measures to mitigate time-cost overruns. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a conceptual framework was developed. A two-stage data collection was used, namely semistructured interviews and a broad questionnaire survey. The qualitative data was analyzed by content analysis of critical incidents. Partial least-squared based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses statistically tested the model hypotheses. The results suggest that project communications and project learning contribute positively to time-cost performance of construction projects. Effective communication tools, critical learning situations, and essential reusable project knowledge are identified. Collective sharing of experiences facilitates personal development and enables effective project learning. A triangulated approach was adopted to conceptualize the control loop-process emphasis on networking and communication, collaborative learning, experience accumulation, and expert judgment as critical elements of continuous learning. As such, this study advances the current knowledge of exploiting project communication management and project learning in mitigating time-cost overruns in construction. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043697647

The resolution of time and cost claims consequently flowing from such delays continues to remain a difficult undertaking for all project parties. A common approach often relied on by contractors and their employers (or their representatives) to resolve this matter involves applying various delay analysis techniques, which are all based on construction programs originally developed for managing the project. However, evidence from literature suggests that the reliability of these techniques in ensuring successful claims resolution are often undermined by the nature and quality of the underlying program used. As part of a wider research carried out on delay and disruption analysis in practice, this paper reports on an aspect of the study aimed at exploring preconstruction stage programming issues that affect delay claims resolutions. This aspect is based on an in-depth interview with experienced construction planning engineers in the United Kingdom, conducted after an initial large-scale survey on delay and disruption techniques usage. Summary of key findings and conclusions include: (1) most contractors prefer to use linked bar chart format for their baseline programs over conventional critical path method (CPM) networks; (2) baseline programs are developed using planning software packages. Some of these pose difficulties when employed for most delay analysis techniques, except for simpler ones; (3) manpower loading graphs are not commonly developed as part of the main deliverables during preconstruction stage planning. As a result, most programs are not subjected to resource loading and leveling for them to accurately reflect planned resource usage on site. This practice has detrimental effects on the reliability of baseline programs in their use for resolving delay claims; and (4) baseline program development involves many different experts within construction organizations as expected, but with very little involvement of the employer or its representative. Active client involvement is however quite important as it would facilitate quick program approval/acceptance before construction, a necessary requirement for early delay claims settlement, which otherwise are often left unresolved long after the delaying events with the potential of generating into expensive disputes. The study results provide a better understanding of the key issues that need attention if improvements are to be made in delay claim resolutions. Additional research focusing on the testing of these results using a much larger sample and rigorous statistical analysis for generalization purposes would be helpful in advancing the limited knowledge of this subject matter. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906254499

The view of contractors has been analyzed to rank the causes of delay and cost overruns on an importance index. The most significant causes of time delay identified in this research are; strikes, border closures, lack of materials in markets, shortage of construction materials at site, delay of material delivery to site, cash-flow problems during construction, and poor site management. The most significant causes of cost overruns are; increase in material prices due to continuous border closures, delay in construction, supply of raw materials and equipment by contractors, fluctuations in the cost of building materials, project materials monopoly by suppliers, instability of the local currency in relation to dollar value, low commitment of donors to compensate any negative outcomes attributable to the poor economic and political situation, and donor policy in awarding tenders to the lowest bidder.

Urban metrics have been used so far for quantification of landscape and land-use change. However, these studies focus on the horizontal development of urban form. Therefore, questions remain about 3D growth patterns. Both 3D data and appropriate 3D metrics are fundamentally required for vertical development pattern extraction. Airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) as an advanced remote-sensing technology provides 3D data required for such studies. Processing of airborne lidar to extract buildings’ heights above a footprint is a major task and current automatic algorithms fail to extract such information on vast urban areas especially in hilly sites. This research focuses on proposing new methods of extraction of ground points in hilly urban areas using autocorrelation-based algorithms. The ground points then would be used for digital elevation model generation and elimination of ground elevation from classified buildings points elevation. Technical novelties in our experimentation lie in choosing a different window direction and also contour lines for the slant area, and applying moving windows and iterating non-ground extraction. The results are validated through calculation of skewness and kurtosis values. The results show that changing the shape of windows and their direction to be narrow long squares parallel to the ground contour lines, respectively, improves the results of classification in slant areas. Four parameters, namely window size, window shape, window direction and cell size are empirically chosen in order to improve initial digital elevation model (DEM) creation, enhancement of the initial DEM, classification of non-ground points and final creation of a normalised digital surface model (NDSM). The results of these enhanced algorithms are robust for generating reliable DEMs and separation of ground and non-ground points in slant urban scenes as evidenced by the results of skewness and kurtosis. Offering the possibility of monitoring urban growth over time with higher accuracy and more reliable information, this work could contribute in drawing the future directions of 3D urban growth for a smarter urban growth in the Smart Cities paradigm. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063680178

This review indicates that there is a lack of a uniform definition of compactness in urban, building and construction studies and a lack of 3D metrics to model spatial and temporal patterns of vertical building developments. To fill these gaps, a new definition of compactness for vertical building developments was developed based on elements of the compactness concept in the literature of urban form in highly dense urban areas by developments of high rise buildings.

For such studies, the first step is to acquire 3D point clouds of urban form such as by airborne lidar sensors. There is a technical question in respect of pixel and object based building classification approaches on time series lidar data as to which approach is more appropriate for comparing volumetric indicators of 3D urban development sustainability over time. This paper aims to answer this question by comparing the results of building classification of bi-temporal airborne lidar datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and an object-based classification tool in ERDAS software. The results show that the omission errors for classified building points are not similar for the same buildings in the bi-temporal lidar data sets. This inconsistency affects the measurement of volumetric descriptors of 3D urban form over time. Therefore, two change detection methods of image differencing and SVM are also evaluated. While the level of noise in the SVM change detection results is lower than occurring in results derived by image differencing, the magnitude of change cannot be determined using SVM. Therefore, we conclude that a combination of change detection methods is preferred for spatio-temporal urban analyses. © 2017 The Authors.

The predominant data that have been used in the construction industry so far is rather less accurate. Moreover, the conventional methods of data acquisition are based on fieldwork that is time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive. Accuracy of original data and efficiency of data acquisition could be enhanced using new LiDAR technologies. LiDAR is the advanced remote sensing technology that is able to provide 3D data with centimeter to millimeter level accuracy effectively and efficiently. However, the implementation of 3D data for accurate as-built creation is still challenging, especially for openings and fine details of the construction objects in an indoor environment. This paper presents a framework for rapid as-built modeling using 3D point cloud data captured by a handheld LiDAR The procedure involves five key stages from data capturing to create a final model. This paper reports the implementation of the framework using the state-of-the-art mobile LiDAR to analyze fine details of a sample building. LiDAR data of a sample building in an indoor environment is captured using a mobile laser scanner and is analyzed after registration and segmentation processes. The reconstructed model using the as-built data is compared with the existing 2D AutoCAD plans of the sample building and the traditional measurements to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The results of this ongoing study confirm that the proposed model development technique can serve as a reliable tool for accurate development of rapid as-built building models (rABM). The accuracy ranges from 5 to 30 mm, depending on the object size and position. The proposed algorithm was shown to be highly efficient in identifying the main visible components in the buildings. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904656907

However, little research has been reported regarding the strategies that construction site technology vendors use to disseminate their products into the construction market. This paper addresses this gap in construction innovation research by focusing on construction site technology exhibitions as a specific technology innovation dissemination strategy. Using observational and documentary data collected from 221 vendors at two technology exhibitions in Australia, hard and fuzzy clustering analysis techniques were used to develop a new vendor dissemination classification framework that shows that construction technology vendors can be classified into five types by the range of dissemination strategies they use. These dissemination strategies can then be classified into five types based on their orientation to physical appearance, interpersonal relationships, and technology demonstration. The results show that the combinations of these strategies are directly related to the type of technology being disseminated. This research and the new theoretical framework presented represent an important counterpoint to the disproportionate focus on customers rather than vendors in the construction innovation literature and the historical focus on information communication technologies (ICTs) rather than emerging construction site technologies. It also addresses a neglect in construction innovation research of recent developments in mainstream innovation research that recognize the importance of customer-vendor relationships. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051218349

Construction research has also neglected to adequately consider the important role of vendors in the innovation diffusion process, focussing mostly on the role of the customer. Set within the context of Australia’s construction industry, the purpose of this paper is to address these gaps in knowledge by exploring the role of customers and vendors in the diffusion of modern equipment technologies into the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: Using contemporary models of innovation diffusion which move beyond the simple dualistic problem of whether innovation is supply-pushed or demand-pulled, 19 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with customers and vendors involved in two major modern equipment technology trade exhibitions in Australia. This was followed by the collection of documentary data in the form of photos, directory books, marketing material, catalogues, websites and booth and exhibition layouts to validate the proposed model and provide insights into vendor marketing strategies. These data were analysed using both content analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Findings: According to the PCA and content analysis, vendor’s engagement in the adoption of modern equipment technologies falls into three stages that correspond to three stages in the customer’s adoption process. In the first stage, customers identify possible solutions and recognise new technologies following a previous recognition of a need. Vendors provide facilities for attracting potential customers and letting customers know that their technology exists and can help solve the customer’s problem. The second stage involves customers gaining knowledge about the details of the new technology, and vendors focusing on detailed knowledge transfer through written materials and demonstrations of the functionality of the new technology. In the third stage, customers have specific questions that they want answered to assist them in comparing different vendors and solutions. By this stage, vendors have built a close relationship with the customer and in contrast to earlier stages engage in two-way communication to help the customer’s decision process by addressing specific technical and support-related questions. Originality/value: The originality and value of this research is in addressing the lack of research in modern equipment technology adoption for building construction and the lack of data on the role of vendors in the process by developing a new empirical framework which describes the stages in the process and the ways that customers and vendors interact at each stage. The results indicate that conceptually, as the construction industry becomes more industrialised, current models of innovation adoption will need to develop to reflect this growing technological complexity and recognise that vendors and customers engage differently in the adoption process, according to the type of technology they wish to adopt. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052572021

This process generally consists of two phases of causation: (1) establishing each party's potential liability for the claimed occurrence; and (2) determining the quantum of the effect flowing from that liability. However, a lack of consensus among the practitioners of disputing parties as a result of the existence of various theories, concepts, and methodologies for apportioning liabilities has been acknowledged as an obstructing factor in delay claims resolution. When determining the quantum of the effects flowing from a liability, one potential main obstacle in apportioning liabilities is the existing dichotomous use of method of delay analysis (MDA), which can be responsible for the inconsistent outcomes of delay analyses and result in distrust among the disputing parties. Aiming to address this problem, the research project was set to develop a decision making model (DMM) to support practitioners in this matter. Following its validation, the developed DMM enhances fairness and transparency in apportioning liabilities, hence overcoming possible skepticism about the impartiality of the chosen MDA. Addressing the current need for an objective way to select the MDA, this DMM has made a contribution to the body of knowledge of construction engineering, particularly in the claims management aspects, by providing a novel tool that can be considered objective, reliable, and defendable for selecting the optimum MDA under the given circumstances of a construction project, and therefore minimizing the potential of conflict and disputes in apportioning delays' liabilities. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982291957

The current literature presented different measurement methods and reported the results of utilisation of new technologies for measuring COVE. However, previous papers used different technology applications covering only a part of the monitoring process with its own limitations. Since technologies are advancing and offering novel solutions, there is an urgent need to identify the gaps, re-evaluate the current methods, and develop a critical agenda for automating the entire process of collecting emissions data from construction sites, and monitoring the emission contributors across cities. This paper systematically identifies relevant papers through a search of three key databases—Web of Science, Engineering Valley and Scopus—covering the publications in the last decade from 2008 to 2017. An innovative robust research method was designed to select and analyse the relevant papers. The identified papers were stored in a data set, and a thematic algorithm employed to find the clusters of papers which might be potentially relevant. The selected papers were used for further micro-thematic analysis to find key relevant papers on COVE, and the gap in the literature. A sample of relevant papers was found relevant to COVE and critically reviewed by coding and content analysis. This paper critically reviews the selected papers and also shows that there is a considerable gap in the applications of new technologies for measuring in-use COVE in real time based on real activities toward automated methods. This review enables practitioners and scholars to gain a concrete understanding of the gap in measuring COVE and to provide a significant agenda for future technology applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064830691

However, prefabricated concrete building projects frequently encounter significant delays. It is, therefore, crucial to identify key factors affecting schedule and explore strategies to minimise the schedule delays for prefabricated concrete building projects. This paper adopts the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) model and analytic network process (ANP) method to quantify the cause-and-effect relationships and prioritise the key delay factors in terms of their importance in the Chinese construction industry. The DEMATEL model evaluates the extent to which each factor impacts other factors. The quantified extents are then converted into a prioritisation matrix through ANP. The delay factors of prefabricated construction projects are selected and categorised based on a literature review and an expert interview. Questionnaires are then implemented to collect the data. The results reveal that the issue of inefficient structural connections for prefabricated components is found to be the most significant factor and most easily affected by other delay factors. This research also suggests prioritising major delay factors, such as 'lack of communication among participants' and 'low productivity', in the Chinese construction industry during scheduling control. Overall, this research contributes an assessment framework for decision making in the scheduling management of prefabricated construction. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057047551

Material deposition processes can achieve infinite geometries. They have advanced from rapid prototyping and model-scale markets to applications in the fabrication of functional products, large objects, and the construction of full-scale buildings. Many international projects have been realised in recent years, and the construction industry is beginning to make use of such dynamic technologies. Advantages of integrating 3D printing with house construction are significant. They include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters to meet functional and aesthetic purposes, the reduction in construction waste from highly precise placement of materials, and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, the researchers applied Strand 7 Finite Element Analysis software to a numerical model designed for 3D printing a cement mix that incorporates the recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE).

This was followed by a survey of the perception of road agency and donor partner officials of the critical causes of road project delays. Findings: About 70 per cent of road projects experience delays and 52 per cent experience cost overruns. The average time overrun and cost overruns of road projects in Ghana was 17 months and US$1.15m (or 22.5 per cent), respectively. The five most critical causes of road construction delays were delay in finance and payment of completed work by owner (client-related); inadequate contractor experience (contractor-related); changes in scope by the owner during construction (client-related); delay to furnish and deliver the site to the contractor (client-related); and inflexible funding allocation for project items (donor-related).

It may be assumed that despite using broadly used terminology to refer to the causes of project delays, the interpretations by respondents may have differed from those intended. Further research could look at the correlation between time overrun and cost overrun using principle component analysis.

The methodology used first critically reviewed relevant published studies, reports, policy documents and management steps used in different countries. Secondly, a structured questionnaire was produced through a two-day interactive workshop with the help of experts and professionals from the road construction industry in Sudan. Thirdly, Relative Importance Index was measured based on the individual responses towards delay factors in road construction projects, and then, the correlation between delay factors and the effects of delay were evaluated. Moreover, the initial findings were analysed and the factors were combined into six groups. The finance competence factors group was found to be the main contributor towards delays in road construction projects in Sudan. Some effective ways were proposed to overcome delays due to financing via use of strategic public and private partnerships for large-scale projects, introduction of bank financing schemes for medium-scale projects, and community-based partnership for small-scale projects.

To reduce such risk, contractors typically include a reserve to mitigate cost overruns and schedule delays. This reserve comprises two categories: (1) a contingency reserve covering potentially required changes, and (2) a management reserve (MR) covering unplanned changes. Since estimating an MR is difficult because the inherent risks are unpredictable, the traditional percentage method is still used for this purpose. To address this shortcoming, this study proposes an MR estimation method based on the cost and schedule performance ratios of international construction projects.

Finally, case studies are conducted to validate the estimated ratios and test the applicability of the proposed MR estimation method. The case study results show that the proposed method can infer the cost and schedule performance ratios within a 5% error rate. As a result, it can estimate the MR more accurately than the traditional percentage method. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018811820

However, a prolonged schedule delay (SD) can have an extremely detrimental impact on a project's efficiency, cost and investment reputation. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential SD risk factors in international highway projects (IHPs) in Vietnam, and to explore the effects of and influences on such factors. A specific risk management framework is proposed as a useful tool for ICCs. Design/methodology/approach - A system of SD risk indicators is presented for IHPs in Vietnam through a questionnaire survey. The system comprises 50 indicators that are grouped into 12 main factors. A structural equation model (SEM) is then used to assess the influences and mechanisms of these factors. Based on the obtained results, corresponding suggestions for preventing SD risks are presented and discussed. Findings - First, among the 12 aforementioned major factors, the authors identify eight facors that have significant effects on IHP SDs. Second, the SEM analysis reveals that policy flaws and the fiscal ability of the owner play the most important roles, on account of their direct and indirect influences on SDs. Originality/value - Considering stakeholders and external environmental effects, a system of indicators is introduced to explore SD risks to IHPs. In particular, an SEM is used to assess the effects of potential SD factors and characterize their interacting influences. This study could help ICCs to avoid or mitigate project delays and cost overruns in Vietnam, and also provide valuable lessons for other developing countries. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034248079

This complexity affects the process of job-site technology dissemination and adoption in which construction companies make decisions to purchase and utilise the new technology. The complexity is one of the reasons that many new remote technologies, positioning and locating systems, lasers and drones, 3D printing, and robots are not widely adopted in the short term, despite vendors making determined efforts to overcome this. Three objectives are investigated in this paper: (i) to define criteria for examining patterns of vendors' strategies to support technology adoption; (ii) to present fact-based evidence of different vendors' demonstration methods; and (iii) to present examples of different technology groups based on their required strategies. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal investigation of the construction technology market, including patterns of technology demonstration and a conceptual model of classifying vendors and their technologies in construction market places. The model involves the three most important factors that distinguish technology exhibitors: Physical appearance, Interpersonal relationship and Technology demonstration. Data was collected from technology exhibitions, involving randomly selected vendors. This data was analysed using hierarchical and c-means clustering techniques. The hard-clustering techniques resulted in vendors being placed in five classes based on the elements of the PIT framework. Fuzzy analysis shows how these classes fit into an underlying strategy spectrum. Understanding the strategies used in each class enables new vendors to select their own dissemination strategies based on their own particular circumstances. The practical implication of this study is to present a set of dissemination strategies to new technology stakeholders involved in Industry 4.0. The identified patterns of technology vendor strategies and the novel conceptual model contribute to the body of knowledge in technology diffusion. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069973315

Likewise, privately funded building construction projects in Bangladesh have been suffering due to schedule delays. This study investigated the main causes of delay in privately funded large building projects in Bangladesh. To determine the causes of delay, a structured interview with 70 respondents was conducted with project owners, consultants, and contractors. Using the importance index analysis method, the study identified the critical causes of delays. The ten most important causes are: (1) lack of experienced construction managers; (2) lowest bidder selection; (3) owners’ fund shortage; (4) lack of proper management by the owners; (5) improper planning and scheduling; (6) lack of skilled workers; (7) inaccurate time and cost estimation by the contractors; (8) site constraints; (9) improper progress monitoring and cost control; and (10) contractors’ cash flow problem during construction. Furthermore, Kruskal–Wallis test indicates that there is no significant variation among the three groups of respondents, i.e., owners, consultants, and contractors. The finding of this study is significant for identifying the most important causes of delay in large building projects. It also identifies the responsibility of major stakeholders (i.e., owners, consultants, and contractors) in causing a schedule delay, which helps them to find mitigation measures for the potential delays of upcoming projects in advance. Although this study provides the insight into the causes of delay in privately funded large building projects in Bangladesh, it is also significant for other similar developing countries. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046778467

This decision making problem involves different factors and criteria that need to be combined in an organized structure that exploits assessments of experts managing such projects. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is found to be suitable for guiding decisions in this problem. A case study for a major natural gas pipeline construction company in Egypt is presented, where three ongoing projects are considered. The proposed AHP structure, along with collected pairwise comparison scores and calculated priorities, suggests halting one project. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of changes in the pairwise comparison scores assigned to the main criteria on the final decision.

Most of the available delay analysis methods employ a deterministic approach that uses deterministic activity duration in as-planned schedules for schedule comparison. However, the duration of construction projects is naturally uncertain. Based on a mathematical-model delay analysis method, this study proposes an innovative approach, the Stochastic Delay Analysis and Forecast method (the SDAF method), which combines probabilistic activity duration and systematic delay analysis procedures to predict the contribution of a single activity’s delay and its probability to cause overall project delay. This paper proposes a methodology and examines its results by means of a simulated case. Although this study has simplified practical problems, preliminary study results are valuable and form a basis for further research. Namely, these study results provide not only a stochastic delay analysis and forecast method but also a fundamental basis for developing advanced schedule delay analysis methodology to help in solving complicated schedule delay problems in construction projects. © 2017 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020713588

Therefore, it will be a serious issue in today’s construction. In view of that, six major groups causing the time delay in the project were identified from literature survey and opinions from the experts in construction sectors. A questionnaire was designed and the project managers were asked to fill the percentage of delay for each group related issues and the overall delay duration of the construction projects. Likewise, 112 completed project details were collected from various constructors. Then the collected data were analyzed using regression analysis. The results of a model were used to fine tune the relationship between the percentage of delay and the major group related issues that causes delay. This model estimates the expected percentage of the time overrun for a particular construction project during the planning stage itself. So that, the necessary action can be taken to minimize the delay and to complete the construction project on time and within budget. © 2017, Research Centre in Public Administration and Public Services,cademy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania.

This problem has many negative impacts on the time, cost, and sustainability of the projects. Many studies were conducted to identify the main causes of this delay in new construction projects in different regions but very few studies have focused on finding an explanation for the causes of delay in major reconstruction projects that have great religious and cultural sustainability. This paper examines the factors that contributed to work delays in one of the most major reconstruction projects that took place recently in the Middle East, which is namely the Mataf Expansion Project in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Fourteen interviews were conducted with project managers, construction managers, and senior site engineers to identify the factors that they encountered and led to the delay in the reconstruction activities of this project. Some of the findings were consistent and similar to most other causes of delay that are associated with new construction projects. However, interestingly, this research has discovered the existence of other unavoidable factors that caused a delay and should be considered for any similar reconstruction projects. The results showed that these factors could be divided into two groups: the first one is related to the demolition phase (five factors) and the second group is related to construction works (nine factors). In addition, it has been observed that the building material during the reconstruction is considered one of the major delaying factors. Finally, these 14 delay factors should be carefully considered to assure the sustainability of the main object's function during the reconstruction activities. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058531688

Manual or semi-automatic classification provides relatively good results, however, automatic classification in complex areas with diverse object sizes is still challenging. This research aims to propose two novel algorithms based on Getis-Ord Gi&z.ast; (or Gi&z.ast; for short) and Local Moran's I (LMI) statistics to classify a lidar point cloud into a set of points representing ground and another set of points reflected from non-ground e.g. buildings and vegetation. The Two statistics, Gi&z.ast; and LMI, have been widely used in cluster analysis to identify clustered features of high z-scores and low z-scores. Based on the two statistics, we proposed two classification algorithms that allow varying window sizes e.g. 100 m, 150 m and 200 m, and applied the algorithms to the lidar data in order to obtain optimal classification results. The results show that the Gi&z.ast;-based algorithm decreases omission errors but increases commission errors when compared to the LMI-based approach. Overall the 100-m window size outperforms than the other window sizes in terms of feature extraction in slant areas, whereas the 150-m window size provides slightly better results in a complex scene of high-rise buildings and dense vegetation, and the 200-m window size is more efficient if large buildings are present in the study area. This feasibility study indicates that autocorrelation statistics such as Gi&z.ast; and LMI can be effectively used to classify a lidar point cloud.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912534662

However, determining the proper number of new laborers to add is quite challenging because newly added laborers' short-term productivity for their first several production cycles could be significantly different from that of existing laborers. While existing studies suggest that newly added laborers' site-learning may cause such a difference, this process has not been considered when forecasting newly added laborers' short-term productivity. In this context, this study presents a method that takes into account site-learning effects and the periodic characteristics of newly added laborers' short-term productivity. The periodic characteristics of productivity are analyzed based on a time-series model of existing laborers' productivity. Then, the impact of the site-learning effect on the productivity is considered based on existing learning-effect theory. An illustrative example demonstrates the accuracy and usefulness of the presented method. Its results indicate that the consideration of the site-learning effect prevents the frequent and counterproductive underestimation of the required number of newly added laborers in establishing an accelerated recovery schedule. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939516390

It is imperative to create awareness of the extent to which such delays can adversely affect project delivery, especially with regard to road construction projects. It is clear that the Libyan road construction industry also faces the issue of not being able to complete projects within the allocated time. This paper identifies the effects of road construction delays, evaluates these through a questionnaire, and assesses them using an empirical method. A detailed review of related literature produced the secondary data, while the primary data was obtained via a structured questionnaire which targeted the road construction projects owners, consultants and contractors. A 71% response rate was achieved; 256 out of the 360 questionnaires sent out were returned. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data received from the questionnaires. The findings of the study reveal that the major outcomes of road construction project schedule overruns in Tripoli, Libya include cost overruns, time extensions, disputes, loss of profit, breaches of contract, poor quality of work and company's bad reputation. The study makes a contribution to the knowledge of the subject of the outcomes of road construction project schedule overruns in Tripoli. Computation of the means and standard deviations, together with a structural equation model, have been used for the data analysis and inference. It is found that delays in road construction projects widely lead to cost overrun, time overrun, litigation and disputes. The findings of the study also provide significant insights into the construction industry, which will help it formulate strategies in order to avoid delays and their consequences. The most important effects identified were time overrun, cost overrun and obstruction of economic and country development. The recommendations and limitations are discussed in the concluding part of the study. © IJTech 2018.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052521939
