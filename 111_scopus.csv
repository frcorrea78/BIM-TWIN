Just the correct choice of a machine does not necessarily lead to the success of a project, which depends more on the design of the tunnel boring machine as well as the definition of measures to cope with all possible events during the advance. The core of the article constitutes a priori determined decision-making process and the resulting guideline and intends to raise awareness of the critical criteria and parameters. © 2018, Ernst und Sohn.

The section comprises a multitude of different civil engineering structures, posing high demands on the interdisciplinary design team. The open sections of the alignment require many over- and underpasses and road diversions. In addition, the majority of the section runs underground through the Flachgau Tunnel, which has the particular feature of a tunnel bridge. The aim of the BIM project is to provide a software-independent, integrated model of the whole project. All parties involved in the project collaborate to define the LOD for the terrain, existing building, land use and geological models, as well as the models for the proposed new infrastructure for the open section, tunnels, ventilation control building, bridges, civil structures and drainage. The LoD are defined in parallel with the AIA according to the KISTE infrastructure identification system used by ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways). At the same time, the BIM execution plans are generated by the team and adapted to the new BIM processes. The opportunities provided by the element-based display and evaluation are anticipated to lead to considerable improvements in the field of interdisciplinary design and visualisation studies. The present article describes the current state of work and provides a preview of future developments. © 2018, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050964497

Digital building models to support the relevant processes in the construction value chain are increasingly being implemented in infrastructure construction. While the use of BIM are quite common in building construction, the design documents of infrastructure structures are still frequently prepared in 2-D. Even when the design is done in 3-D, properties are rarely assigned to the volume bodies. Only in this case it can be called a “BIM working method”. Another difference to the building construction is the much stronger interaction of the selected construction methods with the ground. This applies in particular to underground constructions, as the ground behavior during tunnel drive is primarily dependent on the chosen tunnelling method. Despite extensive exploratory measures, however, the geotechnical properties and the ground behavior are never completely known in advance. Therefore, 3-D-digital ground models have to fulfil special requirements in order to create with BIM-ground models a comprehensive basis for typical use cases such as the simulation and selection of the construction method, quantity surveys and cost estimation, real time monitoring of the ground behavior during the excavation phase. This paper shows a prototypical way in which a ground model can be created and processed in a BIM software. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076964167

The handling of all processes in the life cycle of structures with the aid of a digital building model is inseparably linked with the term Open BIM, especially in Europe. For this reason, the heterogeneous software landscape existing in Central Europe creates problems in data exchange, for which there are basically two approaches for a solution available. On the one hand this is the handling of projects in a closed-BIM approach and on the other hand the use of Open BIM, for which manufacturer-neutral file formats and data structures are required. The IFC format is the state of the art. However, not all so-called characteristics of components, which mainly define their qualities, are mapped there correctly. The essential point in data exchange is the standardization of these features – to speak “a common language”. For this reason, the concept of the property server was developed. On this server all corresponding properties, units, measurements, etc. can be stored and provided with a machine-readable code. In order to demonstrate the application possibilities and the need for features, an ideal-typical BIM process along the construction value chain is presented. Special attention is paid to the functions and possibilities of a propertyserver. The implementation of this concept is shown by means of the propertyserver developed in the research project freeBIM and the software tools implemented in the course of this server. The concept of a propertyserver makes an essential contribution to the optimization of the Open BIM process, but requires a common and coordinated approach both in the national and international context. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn.
