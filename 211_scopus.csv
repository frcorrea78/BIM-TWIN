In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049913864

As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications.

However, in Australia only approximately 3-4% of new building constructions are prefabricated buildings in a year. A major hindrance to the growth of prefab construction in Australia is that systems are developed under commercial and confidential conditions. There are limited publicly-available research and case studies for certifiers, regulators, engineers and academia to provide independent information on the performance, advantages and disadvantages of prefabricated building systems. Independent designers and structural engineers are relying on the strength of the structural and non-structural element, as well as the connections of the prefabricated building systems. This strength is estimated from the ""commercial-in-confidence"" test of individual components by manufactures, and it might result in undesired outcomes in design. This paper provides an overview of available literature on structural performance, benefits, constraints and challenges of prefabricated building systems. This paper also highlights the research needed on the prefabricated building systems such as full-scale tests, numerical modelling, hybrid simulations, case studies and social and economic assessments.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059127797

Designers therefore cannot quantify the environmental impacts of buildings in order to evaluate the environmental performance of their designs early on. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) and building information modeling (BIM) are carried out in the early and detailed building design stages. The method is applied to a residential building in Québec, Canada. The BIM is conducted with Revit, and the LCA with openLCA. To prepare the Revit outputs as the appropriate inputs of the LCA model, a functional database was developed. It includes all building assemblies, layers and possible materials commonly found in residential buildings in Québec. The ecoinvent database was used to source of life cycle inventory (LCI) data for each material. To manage information uncertainty in the early design stage, a probability function was assigned to each material. At the detailed design stage, all material types and quantities were specified in BIM file, which was used in the LCA study. The environmental impacts of the building stages and assemblies were calculated to determine the best building assembly options from an environmental perspective—a process that could guide building designers in the environmental assessments of their designs, making it possible to select more sustainable materials for each assembly and thus reduce the environmental impacts of the building. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062384555

The deployment of emerging technologies allows OG companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the OG industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of OG-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the OG industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the OG industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the OG industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the OG industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the OG industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the OG industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the OG industry is still at an early stage. © 2013 IEEE.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086449098

The main impediments of implementing prefabricated buildings are initial cost and value justification of the whole project. Using evolutionary game theory and system dynamics, this study developed new models to determine the revenue risk related to the use of prefabricated buildings. Four scenarios have been derived based on the assumptions determined by the interests of the developer and the owner or government. The developed models reveal that the stability of the system is closely related to the incremental cost, income and risk associated with the development of prefabricated buildings. Factors such as the profitability of on-site construction projects, the incremental cost of prefabricated construction projects, the total benefits of prefabricated projects, and the incremental risks of prefabricated construction projects impact the game behaviors of developers and owners. A system dynamic model was then used to analyze and verify changes in the behavior of both parties of the assembly of the building demand side and supply side.

In DTs, simulation modeling allows for the building of a digital copy of real processes, which is dynamically updated through data derived from smart objects based on sensor technologies. The use of DT within manufacturing activities is constantly increasing, as DTs are being applied in different areas, from the design phase to the operational ones. This study aims to analyze existing fields of applications of DTs for supporting safety management processes in order to evaluate the current state of the art. A bibliometric review was carried out through VOSviewer to evaluate studies and applications of DTs in the engineering and computer science areas and to identify research clusters and future trends. Next, a bibliometric and systematic review was carried out to deepen the relation between the DT approach and safety issues. The findings highlight that in recent years, DT applications have been tested and developed to support operators during normal and emergency conditions and to enhance their abilities to control safety levels. © 2021 by the authors.

There are, however, practical problems in this approach, including higher risk levels, and cost and time overruns. This study aims to develop a systematic approach for determining the key factors that affect investment risk of prefabricated building projects and assess this risk. Based on literature review, a structured questionnaire was distributed to 210 China-based construction organizations. Relevant evaluation index weights were obtained via questionnaire, and the application of structural equation modelling led to quantitative evaluation of investment risk in the prefabricated construction industry. The results show that the following systems have the most influence on investment risk (from high to low): Economy, technology, market, management, and policy, and that the investment risk of such projects can be assessed using structural equation modelling. Relevant measures are presented to guide investment risk evaluation of projects. This study contributes to literature by considering investment risk influencing factors in this field. Further, the findings can help in understanding the implementation and investment risk control of prefabricated building projects, while providing valuable information to departments that make decisions on improving investment risk performance of such projects. © 2020 The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089111654

To mitigate adverse impacts by the building sector on the environment, PBs have been widely applied in many countries. Although PB policies (PBPs) have played a significant role in guiding, supporting, and promulgating China’s PB development, few studies have systematically investigated these PBPs. As a result, the evolution of PBPs in China is not clear, which limits practitioners’ overall understanding of PBPs. To bridge this knowledge gap, a bibliometric analysis method was employed to review 136 PBPs issued in China from 1956 to 2019. Through text mining, a co-word network analysis, and a collaboration network analysis, we mapped, visualized, and described the PBP system over time. The evolution of PBPs can be divided into four phases: exploration (1956–1995), fluctuation (1996–2005), steady improvement (2006–2015), and rapid growth (2016–2019). Our findings indicate that the PB policy targets, policy objects, policy tools, performance indicators, and the collaboration structure of policymaking agencies have changed significantly across these phases. Lastly, the PB experience in China was compared with those of countries exhibiting higher levels of PB development, which can serve as a reference for PB development. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088313138

Thermal treatment is used in the prefabrication industry to achieve concrete with high strength at an early age (~13 h) and allow continuous production. UC was added to study the possibility of eliminating steaming by replacing it with an exothermic reaction generated by the UC. GGBS was used as a partial substitute for cement to reduce the carbon dioxide emission footprint produced by the cement industry. The compressive strength following the addition of UC was encouraging. A 90% evolution at an early age was observed for concrete samples with 42% UC and 42% GGBS with heat treatment. In addition, when using the same composition, a 66% increase was observed without heat treatment.

Moreover, several technology–effect domains remain, and DT-related technology gaps exist in a number of potential effects. The DT-related patents are distributed unevenly in various industries. For instance, most of the DT-related patents appear in the manufacturing industry.

However, phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) and phosphine (PH3) as phosphorous doping sources that are widely used in industry are of high toxicity. On the other hand, commercially available spin-on dopants (SODs) for laboratory-scale applications are polymer solutions with a large number of phosphorous polymers, leading to a high viscosity. Thus, it is difficult to realize uniform doping on pyramidal surface textured (pyramid) Si substrates using SODs. This study describes the construction of uniform buried pn junctions on pyramid silicon by spin coating ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) aqueous solution as the phosphorous source, which is of low viscosity and can decompose into P2O5 at high temperatures. Owing to the improved charge carrier separation at the uniform junction, the pn+Si/TiO2/Pt photocathode using low viscosity dopants exhibits a high onset potential of 0.58 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and improves the applied bias photon current efficiency from 3.73% (using SOD polymer solution) to 10.6% in 1 M HClO4.

Various information, material, product, service, and fund flows exist in PBPs, leading to high requirements of information exchange and collaboration among the multiple stakeholders. The Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are powerful tools that can support these requirements. However, the IoT platforms have not been extensively applied in industry, which is a significant bottleneck in PBP promotion. Stakeholders are the entities that make decisions on the use of IoT in PBPs and play an important role in its successful implementation. This study proposes a game-theory-based model to reveal the mechanisms of stakeholders’ decision-making on the adoption of IoT platforms in PBPs. The game analysis results reveal the optimal selection strategies of critical stakeholders regarding the IoT adoption under different conditions. The market penetration rate (MPR) of IoT platforms in the PBP markets has been found to be a critical factor that influences the decisions of critical stakeholders considerably. The results of this paper could provide valuable policy implications (i.e., improving the market penetration rate of IoT platforms by developing pilot projects, motivating clients to use the platforms in PBPs, and providing relevant IoT educational programs) for promoting the adoption of IoT in PBPs, which is of benefit to enhance PBP development and further improve energy and resource conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091629979

The most convenient way to employ this metamaterial film-based radiative cooling is to integrate it with buildings as cool roofs. However, metamaterial film-based radiative cooling is more suitable for buildings with higher roof area to floor area ratios, as this accounts for its relative lower cooling power of 110 W/m2 on a daily average. The prefabricated buildings in China are commonly less than two floors, which are preferable for the application of this metamaterial film-based radiative cooling. To clearly reveal the cooling performance of the metamaterial film-based cool roof (MFCR), a single-floor prefabricated building is modelled in this study, and the energy-saving potential and economic feasibility of the application of the MFCR on the prefabricated building are discussed in detail. When comparing the model in this study with buildings that have the more commonly used shingle roofs or typical white roofs, the annual cooling electricity consumption is reduced by 28.9%–43.0% and 7.8%–12.9%, respectively, for buildings with MFCRs located in five cities in China, each in a different climate zone. Furthermore, the simple payback period for the buildings with MFCRs located in all five climate zones is less than three years compared to the buildings with shingle roofs.

Identifying and managing these barriers is key to improving the success rate of prefabricated building design. However, direct studies on these design barriers are extremely rare. The present study solved this problem by combining multiple methods, including grounded theory (GT), structured self-intersection matrix (SSIM), analytic network process (ANP), and the linear weighted sum method (LWSM). GT was adopted to identify the barriers to prefabricated building design and then SSIM was used to analyze the interactions among them. The eight design barriers were finally identified and classified into three clusters: technical barriers, economic barriers, and management barriers. A further analysis found that there is dependence and feedback among these clusters. The technical barrier cluster and management barrier cluster experience self-feedback. A network model based on ANP was next established to calculate the weights of the barrier elements and then this model was combined with LWSM to evaluate the overall design barrier strength of a project case. The results showed that architectural individualization has the greatest impact on prefabricated building design, followed by the collaborative issues among multiple units and professional designer issues. The overall design barrier strength of the project case was larger.

In particular, when the building remains operational during such projects, the redistribution of occupants and interruptions with access corridors/exit egress can exponentially increase the risk for the occupants. Most construction projects are, however, planned and scheduled merely based on the time and budget criteria. While safety is considered paramount and is meant to be applied as a hard constraint in the scheduling stage, in practice, safe evacuation considerations are reduced to rules of thumb and general code guidelines. In this paper, we propose simulation as a tool to introduce safety under structural fire, as a decision criterion, to be mixed with time and budget for selecting the best construction schedule alternative. We have used the BIM (building information model) to extract the building’s spatial and physical properties; and have applied co‐simulation of fire, through computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and occupants’ evacuation behavior, through agent‐based modeling (ABM) to estimate the average and maximum required safe egress time for various construction sequencing alternatives. This parameter is then used as a third decision criterion, combined with the project’s cost and duration, to evaluate construction schedule alternatives. We applied our method to a threefloor fire zone in a high‐rise educational building in Montreal, and our results show that considering the fire safety criterion can make a difference in the final construction schedule. Our proposed method suggests an additional metric for evaluating renovation projects’ construction plans, particularly in congested buildings which need to remain fully or partially operational during the renovation. Thus, this method can be employed by safety officers and facility managers, as well as construction project planners to guide accounting for fire incidents while planning for these types of projects. © 2021 by the authors.
