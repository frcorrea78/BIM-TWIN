This vision is turning into a reality thanks to advances in technology, but there are still challenges to address, particularly in the security domain e.g., data reliability. Taking into account the predicted evolution of the IoT in the coming years, it is necessary to provide confidence in this huge incoming information source. Blockchain has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which we share information. Building trust in distributed environments without the need for authorities is a technological advance that has the potential to change many industries, the IoT among them. Disruptive technologies such as big data and cloud computing have been leveraged by IoT to overcome its limitations since its conception, and we think blockchain will be one of the next ones. This paper focuses on this relationship, investigates challenges in blockchain IoT applications, and surveys the most relevant work in order to analyze how blockchain could potentially improve the IoT. © 2018 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048498829

Majority of the current building maintenance systems mainly focus on capturing either information or knowledge. This research aims to develop an integrated system to capture information and knowledge of building maintenance operations when/after maintenance is carried out to understand how a building is deteriorating and to support preventive/corrective maintenance decisions. To develop the system, a number of case studies were investigated and interviews were conducted with professionals from different building maintenance departments in public organisations. This methodology helped identify the building maintenance process and the opportunities for knowledge capture and exchange. A taxonomy for building maintenance was then identified which enabled a formal approach for knowledge capture. The proposed system utilises the functions of information modelling techniques and knowledge systems to facilitate full retrieval of information and knowledge for maintenance work. The system consists of two modules; BIM module to capture relevant information and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) module to capture knowledge. The system can help maintenance teams learn from previous experience and trace the full history of a building element and all affected elements by previous maintenance operations. It is concluded that the integrated knowledge-based BIM systems can provide advanced useful functions for construction operations. On the other hand, incorporating Knowledge Management principles embedded in CBR systems with Information Management principles embedded in BIM systems is a way forward for the transformation from 'Building Information Modelling' to 'Building Knowledge Modelling'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors.

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062655898

However, the light-weight IoT devices come with a limited storage and processing capacity. Due to this limitation, the need for separate data storage arises so that data can be utilized in the future. These third-party storage services are provided at the cost of a user's privacy. Furthermore, the storage relies on a centralized database which is more open to attack due to its single point security breach chances. Furthermore, present IoT data is not trustworthy in the external environment, as data manipulation is lacking when data is shared with other parties. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations of IoT, the emerging secure decentralized storage technology; Blockchain, have begun to abandon the significant impact in the IoT with the enhancement of security and incorporating a large number of devices in the today's ecosystems.

As the pressure on climate change related risks is mounting, a major cut in carbon emissions from construction operations is becoming a top priority if construction firms are to meet increasingly stringent emission controls. This study describes prototype architecture for implementing a carbon emission prediction and a simulation tool for construction projects using virtual prototyping technologies that is little investigated, analysed and modelled in the existing literature. The estimated emissions of the construction operations for each activity are calculated, tabulated and plotted to visually demonstrate the emission rates side by side with the integrated 4D models of the construction project. The presented virtual prototype (VP)-based model allows project teams to visualise the predicted emissions at different times in the construction processes, analyse the emission peaks, and allow the project team to take proactive measures against potential emissions. A real-life public housing construction project in Hong Kong is adopted to demonstrate the application of the emission prediction visualisation tool. By simulating likely carbon emissions during project planning phases in advance of actual construction activities, it is hoped that the tool can encourage exploration of possible strategies to minimize carbon emissions in construction sector. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878416219

It faces great challenges to meet the goal of transforming the existing building stocks into near zero-energy buildings by 2050. The development of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) schemes in the EU provides a powerful and comprehensive information tool to quantitatively predict annual energy demand from the building stock, creating a demand-driven market for energy-effective buildings. Properties with improved energy rating have had a positive impact on property investments and rental return because of the reduced energy bills. In addition, the EPC databases have been applied to energy planning and building renovations. However, it should be mentioned that the current evaluation system faces problems, such as not being fully implemented, delivering low quality and insufficient information to stimulate renovation, therefore requiring improvements to be made. This paper provides a review of the current EPC situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements. The next generation EPC should rely on BIM technology, benefit from big data techniques and use building smart-readiness indicators to create a more reliable, affordable, comprehensive and customer-tailored instrument, which could better represent energy efficiency, together with occupants’ perceived comfort, and air quality. Improved EPC schemes are expected to play an active role in monitoring building performance, future energy planning and quantifying building renovation rates, promoting energy conservation and sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067995709

The advantages of smart contracts do, however, come at a price. As with most technologies, there are potential security threats, vulnerabilities and various other issues associated with smart contracts. Writing secure and safe smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to various business logics, as well as platform vulnerabilities and limitations. Formal methods have recently been advocated to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between 2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs) for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth research. Our study also provides possible future research directions. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074192785

Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in.

The barriers however, are significant, and the construction industry remains notoriously slow to take up innovations. This study reviews the research work in Industry 4.0 as it relates to construction, and examines a leading UK-based construction firm to ascertain the prognosis for Industry 4.0 roll-out in terms of the impediments and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A multistage mixed philosophies and methods approach was adopted for this study. First, an interpretivist epistemological lens was used to synthesise extant literature as a means of contextualizing the present study. Second, an empirical case study using a post-positivist stance and inductive reasoning was conducted to explore practitioner acceptance of Industry 4.0 in the UK construction context. Findings: Findings from the literature review indicate studies in Industry 4.0 to be a relatively new phenomenon, with developed countries and Germany in particular leading in the field. The range of opportunities are many, but so too are the barriers to enablement. Findings from the case study provide real-world corroboration of the review; practitioners are sanguine about Industry 4.0's potential to reinvigorate the construction industry, but also note that implementation remains curtailed by residual managerial practices dependent on ‘human interaction’. At present, much of the focus of industry practitioners is on the implementation of building information modelling (BIM), often at the expense of other more advanced technologies within Industry 4.0. Originality/value: Research in Industry 4.0 is limited, with the emphasis being on technology application.

Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading.

While BIM adoption is growing, it can be witnessed that adoption is relatively weak within operational and maintenance (O&M) organisations such as Estate and Infrastructure Management, who would ultimately gain the highest value from utilising BIM. While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems. There is a clear gap of knowledge on how to structure a BIM model that allows its efficient use in the O&M phase. Furthermore, there is a lack of claritiy on how to exchange information from a BIM model into an Asset Information Model (AIM). This paper outlines a methodology that enables extraction of BIM-related data directly from a model into a relational database for integration with existing asset management systems. The paper describes the BIM model requirements, development of the extraction platform, database architecture and framework. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. The case study demonstrates that if the BIM model is designed from the start with consideration for the O&M requirements, it can be exploited for development into an AIM.

Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures.

The framework integrates CMMS, BIM, and video-based tracking in a BIM3R setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the user, visualize maintenance operations, and support collaboration between the field and the office to enhance decision making. Finally, a prototype system is implemented and a case study is applied to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. © ASCE 2014.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929332861

This study seeks to identify and rank the perceived importance level of principal research areas associated with the IoT and the construction industry by utilising a scientific mapping tool (i.e. VOSviewer). Such knowledge would enable key drivers for successful adoption of the IoT and digitisation technologies to be outlined. An analysis of key drivers and research trends that facilitates the development of a roadmap for applying the IoT and digital technologies in the construction sector is therefore much needed. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to analyse published work as secondary data, where each publication represented a unit of analysis. A total of 417 peer-reviewed journal review articles covering the IoT within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilising qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings: The results revealed a field of study in a fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation and offering single-point solutions instead of taking an integrated “holistic” approach. Key publication outlets were identified and the main focus of research undertaken being in the technical areas of smart buildings, smart construction objects and environmental sustainability. The major effects of adopting the IoT within the construction industry were identified as high-speed reporting, complete process control, data explosion leading to deep data analytics, strict ethical and legal expectations. Key drivers of the IoT adoption were outlined: interoperability; data privacy and security; flexible governance structures; proper business planning and models. Practical implications: The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of the IoT in the industry. For government agencies and policymakers, this study offers a point of reference in directing the adoption of the IoT smoothly in the construction sector and provides guidelines and standards for maximising the potential benefits. Originality/value: The study is the first scientometric review of the existing body of knowledge in the context of application of the IoT in the construction industry. Findings expose knowledge gaps in contemporary research, specifically, a broader consideration of organisational adjustments needed to accommodate the IoT usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089662794

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element.

This paper presents findings of a feasibility study for using VR 3D sketching interface in order to replace current non-intuitive CAD tools. We used a sequential mixed method research methodology including a qualitative case study and a cognitive-based quantitative protocol analysis experiment. Foremost, the case study research was conducted in order to understand how novice designers make intuitive decisions. The case study documented the failure of conventional sketching methods in articulating complicated design ideas and shortcomings of current CAD tools in intuitive ideation. The case study's findings then became the theoretical foundations for testing the feasibility of using VR 3D sketching interface during design. The latter phase of study evaluated the designers' spatial cognition and collaboration at six different levels: ""physical-actions"", ""perceptualactions"", ""functional-actions"", ""conceptual-actions"", ""cognitive synchronizations"", and ""gestures"". The results and confirmed hypotheses showed that the utilized tangible 3D sketching interface improved novice designers' cognitive and collaborative design activities. In summary this paper presents the influences of current external representation tools on designers' cognition and collaboration as well as providing the necessary theoretical foundations for implementing VR 3D sketching interface. It contributes towards transforming conceptual architectural design phase from analogue to digital by proposing a new VR design interface.

However, user interaction with connected devices suffers from numerous disadvantages such as complex and cumbersome user interfaces, unreliable voice and gesture interfaces, and the requirement for prior knowledge of the environment. This paper presents an intuitive point-and-click framework to control electrical fixtures in a smart built environment. This functionality is enabled by coupling an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based indoor positioning system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to retrieve contextual information of the user with respect to the built environment when the user performs the pointing action. This information is then input into a building information model (BIM)-based virtual environment wherein the appliance of interest to the user is determined. The subsequent clicking action of the user then turns the devices on or off based on its prior state via the IoT infrastructure in the building. Initial prototype testing through a case study yielded promising results that prove the effectiveness of the framework. Apart from the provision of a novel user-interaction mechanism for controlling electrical fixtures, the proposed framework provides a means of extending the utility of building information models (BIM) to the operation phase of a facility and provides a means for its integration with IoT and smart devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060468504

However, our observations of design coordination meetings indicate that even when BIM tools are readily available, practitioners frequently revert back to 2D digital and paper-based drawings and rarely interact with BIM tools on their own without the help of a BIM Coordinator. To better understand the challenges of interacting with BIM, we conducted a long term ethnographic study of a project team performing design coordination using state of the art BIM tools. We developed a taxonomy to represent the relationships between goals, artifacts, interactions and transitions for BIM-based design coordination processes. This research extends this prior work by analyzing the frequency of interactions with different design artifacts, characterizing interactions with state of the art BIM tools, and identifying the motivation behind interactions with design artifacts. An important contribution of this research is the identification and characterization of the transitions participants had between design artifacts and views, which has previously not been studied in depth.

To address the potential security risks in IoT systems, one feasible security practice involves the development of secure and efficient user authentication schemes. In 2017, Dhillon and Kalra proposed a three-factor user authentication scheme for IoT. We noted that their scheme suffers from several security weaknesses. In this study, we specifically demonstrate that the scheme proposed by Dhillon and Kalra (1) is not secured from a stolen mobile device attack; (2) does not prevent a user impersonation attack; (3) does not provide a session key agreement; (4) does not have a contingency plan (e.g., a revocation phase) for situations where a user's private key is compromised, or a mobile device is stolen or lost.

Numerous studies have been conducted over the past few decades to model occupant behaviors stochastically for an improved understanding of their activities for different facility management applications. Despite many research efforts to model dynamic behaviors of building occupants, the understanding of their behaviors by incorporating the contextual information linked to the evolution of the building environment is still not adequately explored. The contextual information linked to locations in dynamic environments changes often over time in terms of position, size, properties and relationships with the environment. This changing building environment affects the occupants’ movements and presence inside the facility which ultimately degrades the process of inferring their accurate activities based on the location context. Henceforth, the evolving building information is required to be mapped with occupant movements for an improved understanding of their changing behaviors. To fill this research gap, a framework named ‘Occupant Behaviors in Dynamic Environments’ (OBiDE) is designed for providing a ‘blueprint map’ to integrate existing DNAS (Drivers, Needs, Systems, Actions) ontology (i.e. a scheme to model occupant behaviors) with our semantic trajectory enrichment model to better understand the occupant behaviors by tracking the dynamicity of building locations.

BCT is a system of recording a database that stores information chronologically and distributes a copy of it over a network of computers that maintain its authenticity and security collectively. This paper first reviews the literature on the issues of information exchange in a BIM workflow and next explores the concept of BCT and its connection with BIM. The literature indicates that BCT shows high potential for solving challenges during the design phase of the project by clarifying liabilities, increasing the reliability of information and enhancing the security of information flow. Its ability to incorporate self-executing contracts enable many more applications around ownership and payments. Finally, the paper discusses a few of its challenges with scalability, user acceptance amongst others. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096550108

It can also become a tool to let device owners contribute freely to the infrastructure. In this paper, we present an authorization and delegation model for the IoT-Cloud based on blockchain technology. We focus on smart city's design and simulation of smart contracts to address the specific characteristics of smart environments and analyze access control and delegation mechanism in IoT. In particular, the scheme is implemented for the Ethereum platform in the form of smart contracts. We present the theoretical analysis of the proposed solution. We perform experiments on local testnet Ganache and public testnet Rinkeby to evaluate the performance of the presented models. Finally, we discuss the results and limitations of the system and possible solutions to issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084478253

This research was conducted so that there can be increase in the usage of IoT elements for construction performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted survey design and various construction professionals were used to assessing the level of adoption of IoT elements. Convenience sample was used by distributing the structured questionnaire to registered professionals. Mean score, bar chart, Kruskal–Wallis H test, one-sample t-test and Shapiro–Wilk were used for analyzing the data gathered. Findings: The findings revealed that wireless fidelity, visualization, wireless sensor networks, Bluetooth, electronic product code and internet protocol are the most adopted element of IoT in the industry. The study also shows that there are areas where there is no significance attached by construction professionals in the usage of IoT elements. These are data storage and analytics, barcode, Zigbee, gateway, near field communication and actuators. It is recommended that less significant areas can be improved through training and educating professionals about the whole concept of IoT and other design professionals. When the importance of IoT elements are understood it will help in the level of adoption. Originality/value: This paper highlights the possible ways of increasing the adoption of IoT elements with a view to achieving better usage for convenience, high productivity of workers and easy access to information. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081373719

They offer means for the secure execution of procedures that no entity can manipulate. This enables applications like the automation of business processes, i.e. entire business relationships in peer-to-peer collaborations can be automated securely. While the blockchain guarantees proper execution it assures the correctness of business collaboration. Since a smart contract cannot be easily changed or updated once instantiated, one has to be absolutely sure that the program code works as expected. This paper presents our tool chain that comprises the formalization of the semantics of smart contracts, via a functional specification of blockchain operations towards a formal representation of the smart contract at question, that can be formally analyzed for correct implementation via model checking. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080082756

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual study follows, methodologically, the structuring inter-textual coherence process – specifically, the synthesised coherence tactical approach. It draws heavily on theoretical evidence published, mainly, in the corporate finance and the business management literature. Findings: A new conceptual framework is presented for CRE to proactively develop insights into the potential benefits of using BD as a business strategy/instrument. The approach was found to strengthen decision-making processes and encourage better RM – with significant consequences, in particular, for business process management (BPM). Specifically, by recognising the potential uses of BD, it is also possible to redefine the processes with advantages in terms of RM. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in the fields of real estate, RM, BPM and digital transformation. To the best knowledge of authors, although the literature has examined the concepts of BD, RM and BP, no prior studies have comprehensively examined these three elements and their conjoint contribution to CRE. In particular, the study highlights how the automation of data-intensive activities and the analysis of such data (in both structured and unstructured forms), as a means of supporting decision making, can lead to better efficiency in RM and optimisation of processes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074361337

We argue that contemporary technologies are components of an improved practice (object) that is adopted, that these practices materialize through interactions among several end-users in an ecosystem (subject), and that they change over time (have temporality). Hence, contemporary technology adoption may be considered “ecosystem adoption of practices over time” (EAPT). We describe how traditional adoption theories treat the object, subject, and temporality of adoption and use practice theory to propose an alternative, EAPT view. Assistive technology and ambient assistive living adoption are used as illustrative examples. We discuss the boundary conditions for applying the EAPT view and elaborate on the implications of taking this view for the research designs of contemporary technology adoption studies. Finally, theoretical, managerial, and policy implications are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078863765

Hence, identifying requirements for IoT development, as a multifaceted phenomenon, whereby the challenges would be tackled remains a less-explored valuable line of inquiry. The purpose of this paper is to present a holistic view of crucial building blocks of IoT development, in order to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts empirical research using a grounded theory (GT), centering on semi-structured interviews with 25 experts involved in the Iranian IoT development effort. Data were analyzed by using MAXQDA software. Findings: This study presents a conceptual framework of requirements for IoT development, consisting of 14 concepts and 5 categories. The findings reveal that strategic, interactive, institutional, market-oriented and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure requirements play a salient role in facilitating IoT development. Practical implications: The findings of this study shed some light on the momentous aspects of IoT development. Practitioners including governmental policymakers, industry and private sectors could benefit from the policy recommendations offered in this study in terms of strategic viewpoint, legal issues, business perspective and technological readiness. Originality/value: From the methodological aspect, the present research is among the first studies on utilizing GT for exploration of requirements for IoT development. From the theoretical perspective, a remarkable achievement of this study is to profoundly discover some less-explored concepts of IoT development such as commercialization, feasibility study, futurology and institutional aspects. Furthermore, findings of this study highlight the contribution of innovation systems theory for the IoT development area in terms of alignment of the emerged requirements for IoT development with the functions of this theory. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075064355
