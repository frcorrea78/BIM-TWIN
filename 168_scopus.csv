In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049913864

The method leverages 4D Building Information Models (BIM) and 3D point cloud models generated from site photologs using Structure-from-Motion techniques. To initialize, a user manually assigns correspondences between the point cloud model and BIM, which automatically brings in the photos and the 4D BIM into alignment from all camera viewpoints. Through reasoning about occlusion, each BIM element is back-projected on all images that see that element. From these back-projections, several 2D patches are sampled per element and are classified into different material types. To perform material classification, the expected material type information is derived from BIM. Then the image patches are convolved with texture and color filters and their concatenated vector-quantized responses are compared with multiple discriminative material classification models that are relevant to the expected progress of that element. For each element, a quantized histogram of the observed material types is formed and the material type with the highest appearance frequency infers the appearance and thus the state of progress. To validate, four new datasets of incomplete and noisy point cloud models are introduced which are assembled from real-world construction site images and BIMs. An extended version of the Construction Material Library (CML) is also introduced for training/testing the material classifiers. The material classification shows an average accuracy of 92.4% for CML image patches of 100 × 100 pixels. The experiments on those four datasets show an accuracy of 95.9%, demonstrating the potential of appearance-based recognition method for inferring the actual state of construction progress for BIM elements. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of buildings and civil infrastructure, the notion of a digital twin remains ill-defined, with little or no consensus among researchers and practitioners of the ways in which digital twin processes and data-centric technologies can support design and construction. This paper builds on existing concepts of Building Information Modeling (BIM), lean project production systems, automated data acquisition from construction sites and supply chains, and artificial intelligence to formulate a mode of construction that applies digital twin information systems to achieve closed loop control systems. It contributes a set of four core information and control concepts for digital twin construction (DTC), which define the dimensions of the conceptual space for the information used in DTC workflows. Working from the core concepts, we propose a DTC information system workflow-including information stores, information processing functions, and monitoring technologies-according to three concentric control workflow cycles. DTC should be viewed as a comprehensive mode of construction that prioritizes closing the control loops rather than an extension of BIM tools integrated with sensing and monitoring technologies. ©",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106009736

Data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques offer valuable information of existing health of the structures, maintain the safety and their uninterrupted use under varied operational conditions by undertaking timely risk and hazard mitigation. Traditional approaches, however, are not enough to monitor a large amount of SHM data and conduct systematic decision making for future maintenance. In this article, building information modeling (BIM) is utilised as a promising computing environment and integrated digital representation platform of SHM that can organize and visualise a considerable amount of sensor data and subsequent structural health information over a prolonged period. A BIM-enabled platform is utilised to develop the proposed visualisation tool for a long-span bridge and enable automated sensor data inventory into the BIM environment. Such automated tool facilitates systematic maintenance and risk management, while avoiding manual errors resulting from visual inspection of the structures. The proposed method can be considered as a user-friendly and economic framework for condition assessment and disaster mitigation of structures from long-term monitored data. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064748508

However, stakeholders in construction are fragmented, which in turn hinders accountable information sharing. To address this issue, the authors aim to develop and test an integrated digital twin and blockchain framework for traceable data communication. The digital twin updates building information modeling in near real-time using internet of things sensors, while the blockchain authenticates and adds confidence to all data transactions to the digital twin. The authors tested the framework with a case project where virtual positioning data from a prefabricated brick is transmitted to digital twin in near real-time, recorded on the blockchain with time stamps. The results show that the integrated digital twin and blockchain framework makes all data transactions traceable.

It allows the creation of a 3D model through parametric modelling in a workflow that updates data, geometry and semantics using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a BIM method for road infrastructures. The creation of the BIM 3D models was carried out using different visual programming software and BIM tools, designing the spatial and parametric representation of the roadway. This way, it has been possible to discover the advantages of using procedural modelling to design road infrastructure through software that are usually used in the mechanical and architectural field. Finally, the interoperability of the software to extract and exchange information between these BIM tools was assessed. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies. © 2021 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103484819

In this framework, the present paper shows an application in the field of geotechnical engineering of the BIM based design approach to the case of an underground line. It is a tunnel excavated by means of traditional method, currently under construction. The project defines, in a central BIM model, a detailed tunnel structure model integrated with geological-geotechnical information for the definition of the subsoil 3D model. Once the BIM model of the tunnel stretch under study was completely defined, it was imported into a finite element (FE) model to perform deformation analyses. Thus, BIM-to-FEM-to-BIM interoperability was exploited in order to verify the maturity level of the BIM approach in the field of application for geotechnical infrastructures. Finally, the BIM fourth dimension (4D) was also implemented in the central model for the time management of the tunnel excavation process, synchronized with the numerical model. The BIM based procedure proposed in the present work can be considered as a case study in the technical literature of I-BIM for tunnels, putting in evidence limitations and advantages: i) a high level of BIM maturity was not yet achieved in the infrastructures field; ii) the BIM-to-FEM interoperability seems to be not fully effective and many operations still require the manual intervention; iii) the FEM-to-BIM interoperability brings back all geotechnical choices and hypothesis to the central BIM model, linking the models into a continuously interoperable circuit; iv) an important part of the design of civil infrastructures consists of addressing geotechnical aspects, hence the inclusion of ground conditions and geotechnical data into the BIM model can improve the quality and the usefulness of the model, not only during the design phase but also, and in particular, during the construction and the lifecycle management of the infrastructure, as a support to decision making process especially in urban context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097469503

The aim of BIM is to provide a complete solution for the life cycle of the built environment from the design stage to construction and then to operation. One of the biggest challenges faced by the facility managers is to manage the operation of the infrastructure sustainably; however, this can be achieved through the installation of a Building Management System (BMS). Currently, the use of BIM in facilities management is limited because it does not offer real-time building data integration, which is vital for infrastructure operation. This chapter investigates the integration of real-time data from the BMS system into a BIM model, which would aid facility managers to interact with the real-world environment inside the BIM model. We present the use of web socket functionality to transmit and receive data in real-time over the Internet in a 3D game environment to provide a user-friendly system for the facility managers to help them operate their infrastructure more effectively. This novel and interactive approach would provide rich information about the built environment, which would not have been possible without the integration of BMS with BIM. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034266901
