Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961126223

There is a growing interest in ZEBs (zero energy buildings) in recent years. Several countries have adopted or considering establishing ZEBs as their future building energy targets to help alleviate the problems concerning the depletion of energy resources and the deterioration of the environment. Broadly speaking, ZEBs involve two design strategies - minimizing the need for energy use in buildings (especially for heating and cooling) through EEMs (energy-efficient measures) and adopting RETs (renewable energy and other technologies) to meet the remaining energy needs. This paper reviews the works related to these two strategies. EEMs include building envelopes, internal conditions, and building services systems; RETs cover photovoltaic/building-integrated photovoltaic, wind turbines, solar thermal (solar water heaters), heat pumps, and district heating and cooling. Issues pertaining to sustainable development implications and further research work required are also highlighted. These include life-cycle cost and environmental impacts, climate change and social policy issues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876971423

Therefore, exergy analysis has been widely applied in parallel with energy analysis in order to find the most rational use of energy. Within the built environment a wide margin for exergy saving may be found. Actually, buildings require mostly low quality energy for thermal uses at low temperatures and nowadays their energy demand is mainly satisfied with high quality sources. Exergy analysis of renewable energy-based climatisation systems may be considered an emerging field, where different and often contrasting approaches are followed. Then, in this paper a comprehensive and critical view on the most recent studies on this topic is presented. Special attention is paid to the methodological aspects specifically related to climatisation systems and renewables, and to the comparison of the results. Main renewable energy-based heating and cooling systems are considered in detail. Finally, conclusions regarding the state of the art and possible trends on this field are derived, with the aim to highlight future research issues and promote further developments of this method.

However, current modeling practices of using energy simulation tools do not model the energy performance of buildings at their element level. As a result, potential retrofit candidates caused by construction defects and degradations are not represented. Furthermore, due to manual modeling and calibration processes, their application is often time-consuming. Current application of 2D thermography for building diagnostics is also facing several challenges due to a large number of unordered and non-geo-tagged images. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new computer vision-based method for automated 3D energy performance modeling of existing buildings using thermal and digital imagery captured by a single thermal camera. First, using a new image-based 3D reconstruction pipeline which consists of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms, the geometrical conditions of an existing building is reconstructed in 3D. Next, a 3D thermal point cloud model of the building is generated by using a new 3D thermal modeling algorithm. This algorithm involves a one-time thermal camera calibration, deriving the relative transformation by forming the Epipolar geometry between thermal and digital images, and the MVS algorithm for dense reconstruction. By automatically superimposing the 3D building and thermal point cloud models, 3D spatio-thermal models are formed, which enable the users to visualize, query, and analyze temperatures at the level of 3D points. The underlying algorithms for generating and visualizing the 3D spatio-thermal models and the 3D-registered digital and thermal images are presented in detail. The proposed method is validated for several interior and exterior locations of a typical residential building and an instructional facility. The experimental results show that inexpensive digital and thermal imagery can be converted into ubiquitous reporters of the actual energy performance of existing buildings. The proposed method expedites the modeling process and has the potential to be used as a rapid and robust building diagnostic tool. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As the largest developing country and carbon emitter around the world, China has also made significant efforts on nearly zero energy buildings in recent decades. The central government has approved many demonstration projects on nearly zero energy buildings in different climate zones for more than ten years.

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

As 20% of total energy consumption in this sector is used for water heating, it follows that 8% of total energy in Europe is consumed for water heating purposes, which provides great opportunities for energy savings. Solar water heating systems (SWHSs) are a suitable technology for renewable energy source (RES) exploitation to be applied in residential building refurbishment that generate both fossil fuel savings and reductions in CO 2 emissions. Due to its complexity, SWHS integration requires a comprehensive approach including consideration of the functional and aesthetic, energy performance, and economic and ecological aspects from conceptual design through to design realization. This article defines a general model of SWHS integration in residential building refurbishment. The model is divided into several basic phases in order to facilitate problem-solving and to enable the individual optimization processes for variant design. The phases are systematically analyzed and a proper procedure and/or methods are established to solve them. At the very beginning of the suggested problem-solving procedure, the measures 'Building Potential', P̃B, and 'Degree of Feasibility', p B , are first introduced in order to estimate the suitability of SWHS integration. A Multi-Criteria compromise ranking method, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of design variants and for the selection of the optimal SWHS integration Design Variant. The proposed general model is also applied for solving a real problem - namely, the integration of SWHS through the refurbishment of residential buildings in the suburb of ""Konjarnik"" in Belgrade, Serbia, which is one of the many that were built in Belgrade after the Second World War. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951505527

This paper assesses optimum retrofit packages aimed at improving the building material thermal efficiencies and energy demand of gas-heated semi-detached and end-terraced houses in Ireland. The cost-optimal methodology framework for calculating cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements is used to determine the optimum retrofit packages from both a householder perspective and a societal perspective. The results of the cost-optimal approach are compared to the results from a weighted framework approach which incorporates life cycle environmental and cost indicators from both a householder perspective and a societal perspective. The results found that the ranking of energy efficiency retrofit designs based on multiple life cycle environmental and cost indicators differ compared to cost optimum designs based on only life cycle energy and cost indicators. The cost-optimal approach was found to be effective for identifying retrofit packages that are among the best packages even without accounting for multiple environmental indicators. However, once multiple indicators were considered, the hierarchy of the optimal retrofit packages changed. In the Irish context, the environmental impact of the Irish electricity grid was found to play a significant role in the hierarchy of the retrofit packages examined. While the cost-optimal method should not be relied on solely for identifying the optimum retrofit package solution, it could be employed as part of the multistage assessment methodology for narrowing down design solution sample sizes.

Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain. The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the process while still providing accurate results.

European requirements place the obligation to reduce energy consumption on all European Union Member States, particularly in sectors with significant energy consumption indicators. Construction is one such sector, as it is responsible for around 40% of overall energy consumption. Apart from a building's mass and its material and installation solutions, its energy consumption is also affected by its placement relative to other buildings. A proper urban layout can also lead to a reduction in project development and occupancy costs. The goal of this article is to present a method of optimising single-family house complexes that takes elements such as direct construction costs, construction site organisation, urban layout and occupancy costs into consideration in the context of sustainability. Its authors have analysed different proposals of the placement of 40 NZEBs relative to each other and have carried out a multi-criteria analysis of the complex, determining optimal solutions that are compliant with the precepts of sustainability. The results indicated that the layout composed of semi-detached houses scored the highest among the proposed layouts under the parameter weights set by the developer. This layout also scored the highest when parameter weights were uniformly distributed during a test simulation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Fast and robust indoor localization is of great importance for location-based facility management services, such as the ones used in mobile computing settings. However, there are several challenges in achieving fast and robust indoor localization: 1) Signal-based indoor localization methods, such as WIFI, RFID, Bluetooth and Ultrasound, require installation of extra infrastructures in a building to support localization; 2) Visual-based indoor localization methods, such as LiDAR and camera, depend on feature point detection and matching, which require heavy computation and can also be impacted by environmental conditions, such as lighting and texture richness. In addition to these, existing localization methods do not support semantic understanding which is of great importance when associating a component with its digital twin. To address the stated problems above, this paper presents a vision and learning-based framework that utilizes a shared convolutional neural network to perform localization and semantic segmentation simultaneously. The proposed framework can support facility management by locating facility components within a building and associate them with their digital twins in an information repository. Compared to conventional methods, the developed image-based indoor localization and semantic mapping framework has the following advantages: 1) It only requires image as input to support localization, semantic understanding, and association, which eliminates the need for extra infrastructure, such as deployment of RFID tags, etc.; 2) It reuses the feature extraction network for simultaneous localization and semantic understanding, which saves computing resources; 3) With 6-DoF poses and semantic labels, it supports component-level association. The authors evaluated the proposed framework on publicly available data sets using three metrics: localization accuracy, semantic segmentation accuracy, and association success rate. The results show that the proposed image-based method can achieve 6-DoF localization and semantic segmentation concurrently. Also, formalized experiments on a synthetic data set with different noise levels introduced to localization and semantic segmentation showed that a main factor affecting the performance of association of an image to its digital twin is the accuracy of its localization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070367173

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082879525

Measurements of several performance parameters with four different HVAC possible configurations are shown as well as monitoring of energy uses and indoor microclimatic conditions in order to verify if comfort conditions inside the building are guaranteed together with the achievement of ‘nearly zero energy target’. Indeed, the study intends to assess the interaction between building and power grid and evaluate the temporal correspondence between building load and PV generation with hourly time step.

A linear static analysis was performed to investigate the instantaneous impacts of dead and wind loads on the complex concrete structure which was completed in 1973. A quasistatic analysis was performed to predict the effects of creep and shrinkage due to dead load on the structure in 2050 to discern its longevity. In 2050, the Sydney Opera House is expected to experience 0.090% element strain due to creep and shrinkage and therefore suffer prestress losses of 32.59 kN per strand. However, given that the current time after prestress loading is approximately 50 years, the majority of creep and shrinkage effects have already taken place with 0.088% strain and 32.12 kN of prestress losses. The analysis concludes that very minor structural impacts are expected over the next 30 years due to creep and shrinkage, suggesting a change in conservation focus from large structural concerns to inspection and maintenance of minor issues of surface cracking and water ingress. The analysis is the first step in the application of more complex finite element modelling of the structure with the integration of complex building information models. The main motivation to undertake the current numerical simulation is to determine a cost-effective solution when it comes to the long-term time-dependent analysis. The paper also will suggest future directions for monitoring unique historical buildings, including 'digital twin'. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069897438

The application of BIM has been studied throughout the years mainly in new buildings with less emphasis in refurbishing existing ones due to the limited availability of accurate data of the original project. However, maintaining and refurbishing existing buildings often contributes to higher risk and cost. In addition, more buildings are required to undertake building assessment schemes such as Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Star, Green Mark, and Green Building Index (GBI)–most were not designed to assess existing buildings. In this sense, laser scanning can be used to collect existing parametric building data as point clouds, which can be developed and used for modelling of energy consumption, comfort and costing.

The energy efficiency solutions were derived by increasing/decreasing the insulation value of the building envelope in successive steps. Financial calculations were based on the investment needed to achieve the nearly-zero-energy levels. Overall, many opportunities exist to decrease the cost and energy use compared to the current (pre-nZEB) practice because the net present value can change up to 150 €/m2 on the same energy performance indicator (EPI) level. The EPI in the cost-even range was reached by combining a ground-source heat pump (between 115 and 128 kWh/(m2·a)) and efficient district heating (between 106 and 124 kWh/(m2·a)). As energy efficiency decreases, improving energy efficiency becomes more expensive by insulation measures. Throughout the EPI range the most cost efficient was investment in the improvement of the thermal transmittance of windows (3-13 €/(kWh/(m2·a))) while investments in other building envelope parts were less effective (4-80 €/(kWh/(m2·a))). If these were possible to install, photovoltaic (PV) panels installed to the roof would be the cheapest solution to improve the energy performance. Integrated project delivery procurement (design and construction together) and the use of prefabricated wooden structures reduced the constructing cost by half (from ~2700 €/net m2 to 1390 €/net m2) and helped to keep the budget within limits. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090801898
