However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals’ survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants’ heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals’ thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including PCS control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models (PMV, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the PMV and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on PCS control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants’ heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals’ thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038211868

We have designed a mobile application that occupants can use on their smart phones to provide their thermal preference feedback. When relaying the occupant feedback to the central server the mobile application also uses indoor location techniques to tie the occupant preference to their current thermal zone. Texas Instruments sensortags are used for real time zonal temperature readings. The mobile application relays the occupant preference along with the location to a central server that also hosts our learning algorithm to learn the environment and using occupant feedback calculates the optimal temperature set point. The entire process is triggered upon change of occupancy, environmental conditions, and/or occupant preference. The learning algorithm is scheduled to run at regular intervals to respond dynamically to environmental and occupancy changes. We describe results from experimental studies in two different settings: a single family residential home setting and in a university based laboratory space setting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the significant amount of energy spent on HVAC operations, thermal comfort conditions in campus buildings are frequently poor. Faulty assumptions or a lack of data regarding occupant comfort can lead to energy waste from overheating or overcooling. Additionally, inadequate operational procedures and outdated technology make it difficult for occupant needs to inform temperature management. For example, campuses frequently use “work order” systems to manage temperature issues, but this process is slow and not widely used by students, i.e., the majority of building occupants. Previous research suggests that thermal comfort feedback from occupants can simultaneously drive energy efficiency and improve comfort in university buildings. However, these prior studies were limited to single buildings or zones inside buildings. This paper describes the campus-wide deployment of TherMOOstat, a software tool that solicits thermal feedback from students, and analyzes its impact on energy use and energy management procedures. Thermal feedback can be submitted any time from any building on central campus. Over 10,000 feedback submissions were received across one year, transforming occupants into meaningful sensors. The research team explored manual and automatic methods to link occupant thermal feedback to the energy management system, resulting in improved efficiency and comfort. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016587982

Additionally, commercial refrigeration (R) systems add about 2 quads to commercial buildings energy consumption. Most HVAC systems have one or more faults (low/high refrigerant charge, valve leakage, condenser/evaporator fouling, filter/dryer restriction, economizer faults, controls faults) that result in increased energy consumption. Automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools have been developed to address this national issue and many tools are commercially available. AFDD tools have the potential to save considerable energy for existing commercial RTUs, chillers and refrigeration systems. These devices can be used for both retro commissioning, and, when faults are addressed, continuous commissioning as well. However, there appears to be multiple market barriers for this technology. A key market barrier for this technology is the lack of awareness of AFDD products among potential customers. Most HVAC contractors are not familiar with the latest AFDD technologies and HVAC technicians lack skills regarding these technologies. Quantifying potential benefits to building owners is difficult since there are several FDD tools with varying capabilities. For instance, there are several FDD products ranging from handling just economizer faults to those that also handle full-blown refrigerant-side and air-side faults. Methods/algorithms used in FDD vary significantly. Even though there are efforts to develop standards, currently there are no standards/methods to define functions, capabilities, accuracy, and reliability of FDD tools. Moreover, most of the commercial AFDD tools have not been verified in the field independently. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to bringing HVAC AFDD tools into the mainstream. The approach involves demonstrating ten commercially available tools at ten different sites, independent testing and evaluation of the FDD tools communication with various stakeholders, identifying market barriers, and assisting utility companies in developing incentive programs. This paper presents selection of AFDD tools, site identification, and field testing and evaluation method. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078707003
