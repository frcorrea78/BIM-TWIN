This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037934719

In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications. The classified inventory could be useful for scientists as well as stakeholders in the geospatial industry, such as companies and national mapping agencies, as it may serve as a reference document to better position their operations, design product portfolios, and to better understand the market. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952802912

The LIDAR data collected from a nadir direction is a point cloud containing surface samples of not only the building roofs and terrain but also undesirable clutter from trees, cars, etc. The main contribution of this work is the automatic recognition and estimation of simple parametric shapes that can be combined to model very complex buildings from aerial LIDAR data. The main components of the detection and modeling algorithms are (i) Segmentation of roof and terrain points, (ii) Roof topology Inference. We introduce the concept of a roof-topology graph to represent the relationships between the various planar patches of a complex roof structure. (iii) Parametric roof composition. Simple parametric roof shapes that can be combined to create a complex roof structure of a building are recognized by searching for sub-graphs in its roof-topology graph. (iv) Terrain Modeling. The terrain is identified and modeled as a triangulated mesh. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the validity of our approach for rapid and automatic building detection and geometric modeling with real LIDAR data.

Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic-Cartographic Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as a simplified version of those in ATKIS data. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894234422

In the proposed framework, the ground and nonground LIDAR measurements are first separated using a progressive morphological filter. Then, building measurements are identified from nonground measurements using a region-growing algorithm based on the plane-fitting technique. Finally, raw footprints for segmented building measurements are derived by connecting boundary points, and the raw footprints are further simplified and adjusted to remove noise caused by irregularly spaced LIDAR measurements. Data sets from urbanized areas including large institutional, commercial, and small residential buildings were employed to test the proposed framework. A quantitative analysis showed that the total of omission and commission errors for extracted footprints for both institutional and residential areas was about 12%. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework identified building footprints well. © 2006 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748316692

Our experimental set up consists of a truck equipped with one camera and two fast, inexpensive 2D laser scanner, traveling on city streets under normal traffic conditions. The horizontal laser scans are used to determine the approximate component of motion along the movement of the acquisition vehicle. The vertical scanner is used to build 3D models of the facade of the buildings. To improve the accuracy of localization of the truck and hence our resulting 3D models of the city, two different methods are developed and compared: the first method employs a correlation technique and the second method is based on Markov Monte Carlo localization. Both techniques use digital road maps and aerial photographs in conjunction with laser scans. A fairly accurate textured, 3D model of downtown area has been acquired in a matter of few minutes, limited only by traffic conditions during the data acquisition phase.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035680915

The proposed approach may be decomposed in two steps, each of them relying on a global optimization solver. The first step aims to extract rectangular building footprints directly from the DSM using a Marked Point Process (MPP) of rectangles. We introduce an energy that prevents overlapping rectangles and aligns rectangle edges with DSM discontinuities. This energy is then embedded in a RJMCMC sampler coupled with a simulated annealing to find its global optimum. Then, the second step of our framework refines these extracted rectangles into polygonal building footprints. We first create an arrangement of line segments supporting the rectangle edges. The dual graph of this arrangement is then considered in a maximum flow optimization scheme to remove edges in the arrangement which do not correspond to building edges in the DSM. Finally, 3D results illustrate a fully automatic process to build a 3D city model from a DSM only. © 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Until now the focus has mostly been on buildings. Nonetheless many applications could also benefit from detailed models of public street space for further analysis. However, there are only few guidelines for representing roads within city models. Therefore, related standards dealing with street modelling are examined and discussed. Nearly all street representations are based on linear abstractions. However, there are many use cases that require or would benefit from the detailed geometrical and semantic representation of street space. A variety of potential applications for detailed street space models are presented. Subsequently, based on related standards as well as on user requirements, a concept for a CityGML-compliant representation of street space in multiple levels of detail is developed. In the course of this process, the CityGML Transportation model of the currently valid OGC standard CityGML2.0 is examined to discover possibilities for further developments. Moreover, a number of improvements are presented. Finally, based on open data sources, the proposed concept is implemented within a semantic 3D city model of New York City generating a detailed 3D street space model for the entire city. As a result, 11 thematic classes, such as roadbeds, sidewalks or traffic islands are generated and enriched with a large number of thematic attributes. © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033445624
