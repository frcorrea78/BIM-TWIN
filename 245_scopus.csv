The basic operating principle of smart aggregates is first introduced. The proposed smart aggregate is formed by embedding a waterproof piezoelectric patch with lead wires into a small concrete block. The proposed smart aggregates are multi-functional and can perform three major tasks: early-age concrete strength monitoring, impact detection and structural health monitoring. The proposed smart aggregates are embedded into the desired location before the casting of the concrete structure. The concrete strength development is monitored by observing the high frequency harmonic wave response of the smart aggregate. Impact on the concrete structure is detected by observing the open-circuit voltage of the piezoceramic patch in the smart aggregate. For structural health monitoring purposes, a smart aggregate-based active sensing system is designed for the concrete structure. Wavelet packet analysis is used as a signal-processing tool to analyze the sensor signal. A damage index based on the wavelet packet analysis is used to determine the structural health status. To better describe the time-history and location information of damage, two types of damage index matrices are proposed: a sensor-history damage index matrix and an actuator-sensor damage index matrix. To demonstrate the multi-functionality of the proposed smart aggregates, different types of concrete structures have been used as test objects, including concrete bridge bent-caps, concrete cylinders and a concrete frame. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness and the multi-functionality of the proposed smart aggregates. The multi-functional smart aggregates have the potential to be applied to the comprehensive monitoring of concrete structures from their earliest stages and throughout their lifetime. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749115024

The objective is to provide a solution to measure both temperature and humidity inside a concrete structure. The research has been focused in the early age and curing phase period. Four solutions have been addressed. The first one involves the use of a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor and an IRIS mote allowing for the creation of an IEEE 802.15.4 network. However, the results have shown that the sensor measurements present a 5°C standard deviation between the actual and the experimental values. The second one considers the use of the SHT15 (humidity/temperature) sensor, together with the PIC18F4680 microcontroller or the Arduino platform. The third solution involves the use of the SHT21S (humidity/temperature) sensor and the eZ430-RF2500 wireless development tool platform for the MSP430 microcontroller. In this case, the temperature readings were successfully performed for the first 16 h, while the humidity values were successfully obtained for the first 24 h of the experiment. Although the set of measured values is very promising for the SHT15 and SHT21S sensors, both sensors have stopped working after some time, showing that direct contact between the sensor and the concrete alkaline environment causes its breakdown. Finally, the fourth solution considers both the SHT15 and SHT21S sensors completely shielded allowing for the creation of a long-term solution. As, the SHT15 and SHT12S sensors have not been affected by the alkaline environment for more than two months of operation, enabling real-time and continuous monitoring with almost non-intrusive tiny devices, the potential of applying the proposed inexpensive wireless sensor network approach is verified. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While in building information modeling (BIM) conventional building information (such as geometry, material, or cost) can precisely be described using current modeling standards, information about SHM systems, referred to as “monitoring-related information” cannot be fully described on a well-defined, formal basis. In this paper, a BIM-based approach towards describing monitoring-related information is proposed, using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open BIM standard facilitating the interoperability of BIM models, as a formal basis. First, possibilities and constraints of describing monitoring-related information with the IFC schema are discussed. Then, information necessary to describe SHM systems is integrated into a semantic model serving as a technology-independent metamodel. Next, the IFC schema is extended to enable BIM-based descriptions of SHM systems in compliance with IFC modeling capabilities, which is referred to as “IFC Monitor” schema. The IFC Monitor schema is verified with test software used in the official IFC certification program. For validation, a prototype SHM system is formally described using the IFC Monitor schema. The validation aims at checking if the IFC Monitor schema is capable of precisely describing monitoring-related information. As will be shown in this paper, the description of the prototype SHM system meets the requirements of a well-defined IFC model as specified in the official IFC certification program. As a result, the IFC Monitor schema proposed in this study advances BIM-based descriptions of SHM systems in association with structural systems being monitored on a well-defined, formal basis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046801394

Suggestions on how to strengthen this interaction are provided. The paper also argues that successful adoption of RFID technology in the construction industry is not realized yet, and accordingly calls on more integrated RFID technology implementation from a building life-cycle perspective.

The advance in recent years of wireless technologies has allowed the development of miniaturised sensing systems, which have now reached a stage of development that allows them to be embedded into concrete. This paper describes the design and performance analysis, under replicated building site conditions, of an embeddable wireless sensing node for monitoring concrete curing and structural health. Wireless sensors with temperature and relative humidity measurement capabilities were designed with onboard communication using the 433 MHz ISM band and embedded into concrete. Testing, which replicated on-site conditions, was carried out on the sensors to determine what the effect of the concrete itself, the steel reinforcement, and steel backed formwork had on the transmission of data. The transmission distance and reliability of receiving data was quantified. Test results confirm that it is possible to deploy an embedded sensor system and transmit live data from the embedded sensor to a data acquisition system located outside the concrete. Preliminary results show that steel backed formwork reduces the transmission distance of the sensors to 3. 5 m from 5 m without formwork. Analysis of the data from the sensor showed that, while temperature readings were reliable, the method of measuring relative humidity, using a shielded humidity sensor, may not be suitable for use over the full lifetime of the structure. Accordingly, the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method was enhanced to allow it be used in an embedded system incorporating the AD5933 impedance chip. The EMI method has been successfully applied to monitor the strength development and deterioration of concrete but limited investigation has been carried out into advancing the method for deployment in embedded sensing systems. Analysis of the strength development of freshly mixed concrete and the effects of loading on the response of the sensor show that it is possible to monitor both the strength development and subsequent deterioration of concrete by monitoring the reactance antiresonant frequency shift and peak resistance of a piezoelectric material embedded into concrete. Analysis of the reactance antiresonant frequency shift showed that the technique successfully monitored the compressive strength development of the concrete structure, while monitoring the reactance antiresonant frequency shift in conjunction with the resistance peak provided important information on the condition of the concrete under loading conditions. This is believed to be the first time that the EMI method for monitoring concrete curing and structural health has been demonstrated for use in an embedded wireless sensing system. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867956912
