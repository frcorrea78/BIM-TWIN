In this paper we present CityGML, a multi-purpose and multi-scale representation for the storage of and interoperable access to 3D city models in SDIs. CityGML is based on the standard GML3 of the Open Geospatial Consortium and covers the geometrical, topological, and semantic aspects of 3D city models. The class taxonomy distinguishes between buildings and other man-made artifacts, vegetation objects, waterbodies, and transportation facilities like streets and railways. Spatial as well as semantic properties are structured in five consecutive levels of detail.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

The list of KPIs established in an earlier paper is narrowed down considering the future research needs suggested by the literature. Findings: The quantifiable and measurable core indicators are identified and categorized in the form of a list. The core indicators are defined and the variables required to quantify them are described by citing peer-reviewed literature. Research limitations/implications: This paper represents the first step toward establishing a relevant list of quantifiable and measurable core KPIs. Future research papers could emphasize derivation of mathematical expressions for determining the identified core KPIs and validating these KPIs using simulation of real building data. Practical implications: The need to establish a concise and relevant list of quantifiable and measurable KPIs that could express more than one type of information about a facility's performance is identified in this paper.

This knowledge includes measurable attributes such as facility importance, management unit importance, condition (past, present, and predicted future), desired condition thresholds, and expected asset remaining life. Also, recognizing that there are several inspection objectives to be met at different times in a management unit life cycle, different levels of inspections may be used at different times to attain those objectives. The knowledge-based condition survey inspection (KBCSI) approach marries all of these elements together to develop inspection plans for a vast array of facility components.

Achieving this requires the ability to represent a city as a complex system of connected and interdependent components in which the topology of the electricity, water, gas, and heat demand-supply networks are modelled in an integrated manner. However, integrated modelling of these networks is hampered by the disparity between the predominant data formats and modelling processes used in the Geospatial Information Science (GIS) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) domains.

The system uses a graph database to integrate the topology of utility network components represented in the CityGML UtilityNetwork Application Domain Extension (ADE), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) real-time streaming messages. A message broker is used to disseminate the changing state of the integrated topology and the dynamic resource flows derived from the streaming data.

While this is aimed at new construction, it can be foreseen that a wider introduction of BIM could also result in savings during large refurbishment projects, which form a significant part of construction work in the UK, as well as during the occupancy phase of the building. However, unlike new projects, where the model for the BIM can be obtained from CAD drawings, deriving a detailed BIM for pre-existing structures requires some form of scan-to-BIM operation using laser scanning. To contribute to sustainability in construction, an underlying driver for BIM, the BIM must also be integrated with other data sources. Therefore, once the scan is complete, the resulting point cloud must be converted into geometry objects and geo-referenced for integration with Geographical data such as air quality or noise information.

Rating of the building components serves as a benchmark for comparison during condition assessment of the building. The aim of this study is to carry out comparative analysis of existing building component rating models. This study compares 9 different building component rating systems followed by their critical analysis and comparison of similarities, differences and limitations. Similarities between different rating system reviewed are that the condition of a building is assessed by dividing entire building into smaller components into a hierarchy, the severity of building defects is assessed using a rating scale and weighting coefficients are used to determine the relative importance of each component for assessment in the final aggregated rating. Major differences between different building component rating systems were the objectives and scope of the assessment, different methodology, tools and aggregation techniques used to arrive at final assessment of whole building. The processes to evaluate the rating of building components were highly subjective as most of the rating systems were based on visual observation and interpretation of the inspection personnel. Existing inspection practices and rating methodology can be improved to reduce the time, cost and subjectivity in assessment of building components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087202927

The proposed model is based on the visual assessment of 110 timber claddings, subjected to real exposure conditions. The claddings under analysis belong to 80 buildings, with and without heritage characteristics, located in Valdivia and Niebla, South Chile. Timber claddings are a relevant symbol of the local identity of this region, portraying a complexity of ideas and cultural values, inherited by Spanish and German colonizations. The main anomalies that can occur in these claddings are translated into a numerical index, which describes the overall degradation condition of a timber façade. This work also discusses the influence of the local climate and environmental exposure conditions, considering biotic factors (fungi, insects, moulds, algae and bacteria) and abiotic factors (water, solar radiation, amplitude of temperature, physical damage) in the evolution of the degradation condition of timber claddings. The scarcity of funds in Chile to maintain and preserve the constructions and its components needs a more rational approach to decision-making concerning inspection, maintenance and rehabilitation procedures.

The result of this integration - broadly termed as GeoBIM - has a range of potential uses from district study to road safety. However, from the data perspective, this integration raises the question of how to integrate very detailed design and construction data from the BIM domain with contextual geospatial data (both 2D and 3D) that model a very diverse range of aspects of the wider built and natural environment. This paper reports work carried out during the second phase of the EuroSDR GeoBIM project, which sets out to understand the general status of GeoBIM across Europe with particular focus from a National Mapping and Cadastral Agency perspective. The first phase of the project reviewed the current status of GeoBIM in participating countries and identified the need for specific detailed use cases to overcome both the lack of awareness and the lack of understanding of the potential of GeoBIM. We present both an update on the current status of GeoBIM, and additional details of one of the selected use cases relating to planning/development permits.

Moreover, the increased complexity of the digitized assets leads Facility Managers to the adoption of interdisciplinary metrics that are able to measure the peculiar dynamics of the asset-service system. The aim of this research concerns the development of a cross-domain Decision Support System (DSS) for maintenance optimization. The algorithm underpinning the DSS enables the maintenance optimization through a wiser allocation of economic resources. Therefore, the primary metric encompassed in the DSS is a revised version of the Facility Condition Index (FCI). This metric is combined with an index measuring the service life of the assets, one measuring the preference of the owner and another measuring the criticality of each component in the asset. The four indexes are combined to obtain a Maintenance Priority Index (MPI) that can be employed for maintenance budget allocation. The robustness of the DSS has been tested on an office building in Italy and provided good results. Despite the proposed algorithm could be included in a wider Asset Management system employing other metrics (e.g., financial), a good reliability in the measurement of cross-domain performance of buildings has been observed. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069898658

Traditional periodic inspection with fixed inspection interval has low efficiency in the early age or high risk in the later age of tunnel. This study aims at developing a novel non-periodic inspection policy and investigating the adaptability of several inspection scheduling functions with different degradation modes. Three classical degradation modes (namely, accelerated, decelerated and stationary) are categorized to describe the potential trends of degradation, and they are modeled by non-stationary Gamma process in a unified form. The effects of three types of inspection scheduling functions on the tunnel maintenance are compared in the view of the expectation of lifetime maintenance cost. The results of the numerical analysis show that inspection schedule function f2(x) (in the form of a convex curve) always yields the lowest maintenance cost, regardless of the degradation mode of tunnel. The results indicate that the inspection scheduling function in the type of a convex function is the best and shortening the inspection interval is an effective measure to reduce maintenance cost and risk. The proposed method and the obtained results are helpful for practitioners to make more effective inspection scheduling and to reduce both risk and cost associated with the maintenance of tunnels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094323681

Work has been carried out relating GeoBIM/AM to buildings as well as infrastructure assets, where the potential financial savings are extensive. While information form BIM maybe be sufficient for building-AM; for infrastructure AM a combination of GIS and BIM is required. Scientific literature relating to this topic has been growing in recent years and has now reached a point where a systematic analysis of current and potential uses of GeoBIM in AM for Infrastructure is possible. Three specific areas form part of the analysis - a review of <i>BIM and Infrastructure AM</i> and <i>GIS and Infrastructure AM</i> leads to a better understanding of current practice. Combining the two, a review of <i>GeoBIM and Infrastructure AM</i> allows the benefits of, and issues relating to, GeoBIM to be clearly identified, both at technical and operational levels.

Understanding the limitations to the usability of such models on these devices is particularly important given the broadening range of applications - such as pollution or noise modelling, tourism, planning, solar potential - for which these datasets and resulting visualisations can be utilized. Much 3D City Model data is created by extrusion of 2D topographic datasets, resulting in what is known as Level of Detail (LoD) 1 buildings - with flat roofs. However, in the UK the National Mapping Agency (the Ordnance Survey, OS) is now releasing test datasets to Level of Detail (LoD) 2 - i.e. including roof structures. These datasets are designed to integrate with the LoD 1 datasets provided by the OS, and provide additional detail in particular on larger buildings and in town centres. The availability of such integrated datasets at two different Levels of Detail permits investigation into the impact of the additional roof structures (and hence the display of a more realistic 3D City Model) on rendering performance on a mobile device. This paper describes preliminary work carried out to investigate this issue, for the test area of the city of Sheffield (in the UK Midlands). The data is stored in a 3D spatial database as triangles and then extracted and served as a web-based data stream which is queried by an App developed on the mobile device (using the Android environment, Java and OpenGL for graphics). Initial tests have been carried out on two dataset sizes, for the city centre and a larger area, rendering the data onto a tablet to compare results. Results of 52 seconds for rendering LoD 1 data, and 72 seconds for LoD 1 mixed with LoD 2 data, show that the impact of LoD 2 is significant. © 2013 Copernicus.

In this regard, national and regional policies have an important role in controlling the level of the interventions and giving the stakeholders tools that allow taking sustained decisions. For that, it is fundamental that the decision-making entities have the information concerning built heritage characteristics and in-situ conditions, and incorporate this data in their policies, namely through inventorying and cataloguing processes. Such information is also fundamental to establish differentiated levels of intervention and support the consideration of flexible and proportional criteria in building codes and regulations.

While these assessments can provide a benefit to asset management decision making, they also require resources in terms of time, personnel, and funding. When these resources are finite, as they typically are in facility management, it is important to understand the value that an assessment can provide. Of particular interest to facility managers is determining the optimal time to inspect the components of a building to maximize this value. To achieve this, the paper presents a methodology to calculate the value that building component inspection information provides toward the work planning decision process. The methodology uses a value of information decision tree with a Markov component condition prediction model to calculate the probability of failure. This approach considers the time since the last inspection occurred, the expected condition state of the component, the risk consequence associated with failure, and the cost of risk mitigation related to proactive repair or replacement activities. Results of an applied case study indicate that there is indeed an optimal time since the last inspection that optimizes this value, allowing managers to better allocate scarce inspection resources using this model. In addition, varying inspection types with different levels of detail and accuracy can be analyzed, allowing for a selection of the best type of inspection to perform given the component life-cycle situation, in addition to the inspection frequency. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048299542

Increase in defects due to age, usage, and other factors, requires extensive maintenance activities known as renovation. The data used for a typical renovation plan can be collected using the condition assessment (CA) tool which depends on physical inspection of the defects or through a facility condition index which hinges on harnessing and analyzing the information in the operational history of the facility. The purpose of this paper is to examine the quality of a typical renovation plan using both tools. Design/methodology/approach: The single case study of qualitative research was adopted. The data were collected through the principle of semi-structured questionnaire complemented with interviews and document analysis. The documents include periodic operational reports and a CA report used for planned renovation exercise of the Facilities Management (FM) Unit in a higher education institution in South Africa. Findings: The findings revealed that although the FM Unit produces periodic reports, but there was no evidence of detailed analysis of the reports. Therefore, the programmed renovation exercises are based purely on the information from a CA. Research limitations/implications: This research is a single site case study of qualitative research; the data collected are limited and not sufficient for generalization of the results. Furthermore, the lack of record of the analysis of the operational history in the periodic reports negatively affected the computation of facilities condition index (FCI). Thus it was not possible to demonstrate the strength of FCI over CA from empirical information. Originality/value: The quality of a typical renovation plan is influenced by the tool used for data collection. Although the CA tool is commonly used, experience shows that the renovation exercise developed from such records is prone to many execution setbacks, such as frequent scope changes and the associated cost and time overruns. These setbacks can be minimized if the FCI is used as the tool for data collection. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045407711

To that end, we defined a condition assessment process thru four main steps, with four key algorithms, to ensure BIM-based data interoperability. The proposed approach will enable facility managers who are responsible for component conditions to use a BIM-based model directly in the facility management system without having to do additional manual data input.

Often, 3D city models are created by elevating the buildings from a detailed 2D topographic base map and subsequently used in studies such as solar panel allocation, infrastructure remodelling, antenna installations or even tourist guide applications. However, the large amount of resulting data slows down rendering and visualisation of the 3D models, and can also impact the performance of any analysis. Generalisation enables a reduction in the amount of data - however the addition of the third dimension makes this process more complex, and the loss of detail resulting from the process will inevitably have an impact on the result of any subsequent analysis. While a few 3D generalization algorithms do exist in a research context, these are not available commercially. However, GIS users can create the generalised 3D models by simplifying and aggregating the 2D dataset first and then extruding it to the third dimension. This approach offers a rapid generalization process to create a dataset to underpin the impact of using generalised data for analysis. Specifically, in this study, the line of sight from a tall building and the sun shadow that it creates are calculated and compared, in both original and generalised datasets. The results obtained after the generalisation process are significant: both the number of polygons and the number of nodes are minimized by around 83% and the volume of 3D buildings is reduced by 14.87 %. As expected, the spatial analyses processing times are also reduced. The study demonstrates the impact of generalisation on analytical results - which is particularly relevant in situations where detailed data is not available and will help to guide the development of future 3D generalisation algorithms. It also highlights some issues with the overall maturity of 3D analysis tools, which could be one factor limiting uptake of 3D GIS. © Authors 2018.
