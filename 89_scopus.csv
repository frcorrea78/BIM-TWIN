Intelligence comes from data. Integrated analysis for the manufacturing big data is beneficial to all aspects of manufacturing. Besides, the digital twin paves a way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing, which is an important bottleneck to achieve smart manufacturing. In this paper, the big data and digital twin in manufacturing are reviewed, including their concept as well as their applications in product design, production planning, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance. On this basis, the similarities and differences between big data and digital twin are compared from the general and data perspectives. Since the big data and digital twin can be complementary, how they can be integrated to promote smart manufacturing are discussed. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041173790

Product digital twin is one of applications of digital twin technology in the process of product development. However, the research on it is still in its infancy and there are only few unsystematic research findings presented. The concept of digital twin technology based on review of digital twin background and the architecture for product digital twin based on systematic analysis of its connotation were proposed. The implementation approach of product digital twin in the stage of product design, manufacturing and service was investigated. The evolving trends of product digital twin concerning its features in the future were predicted. © 2017, Editorial Department of CIMS. All right reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021844855

To establish a management information system for construction engineering supervision based on the relevant technology of pervasive computing (PESS) will allow you to carry out monitoring and supervision to the construction sites at all times and places without any limit of space and area. The supervision company and construction enterprises can access the supervision information integratedly distributed in different places anytime and anywhere to achieve the information-based support for the supervision core functions of ""four controls, three managements and one coordination"". © 2010 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956602003

And the application of collaboration management to manufacturing industry achieves good results since its setting. The paper analyses the application situation of the use of Collaboration management within the project management and the existent problems, such as difficulties in the information sharing and the information can't deliver smoothly. The process of project collaboration management is put forward. And the paper also discusses that the BIM creates for the phase of the design, bidding and construction, which makes the delivery of the Information smoothly and let the collaboration management more efficient. At last, it comes to a conclusion that it is necessary to set a new project organization up before using BIM during project management. © 2011 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960428298
