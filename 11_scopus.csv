It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029313621

With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed.

This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University’s city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year.

If a journal satisfies either of the two criteria, we conclude that its assignment to categories may be questionable. Accordingly, we identify all journals with questionable classifications in Web of Science and Scopus.

An evolutionary view is overlooked because extant literature describes technology in a particular epoch. An ecosystem perspective needs to influence IT strategy as an emerging “digital layer” transcends a smart city and continues to function long after a traditional construction project completes. We describe innovation as a succession of transformational waves in an evolutionary process that is currently manifesting as “Industry 4.0” and changing expectations for the construction industry.

Hence, this study proposes an integrated design system for the improvement of BIM-based collaborative design. For this purpose, problems are derived based on an analysis of conventional BIM-based collaborative design. In addition, a concept for the development of the BIM-based integrated design system is established from integration methodologies. Based on 'functional integration,' 'integrated information management' and 'integrated process support,' the integrated design system is implemented through the combination of three modules: BIM Modeler, BIM Checker and BIM Server. To test the integrated design system, a case study on a hospital building design is reviewed, and improvements compared to the conventional system are examined.

Most of the reports suggest the adoption of innovations including off-site manufacture and emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) to overcome the challenges facing the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of off-site manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of off-site manufacture, the benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture have been widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction. However, studies about impacts of BIM on off-site manufacture are scarce with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates the implications of BIM systems on off-site manufacture and traditional construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of BIM for off-site manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support off-site manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of off-site manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture and traditional construction is undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on off-site manufacture, off-site manufacture and BIM on traditional construction. The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on off-site manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient and one of the best ways to improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the construction industry for generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031763679

Existing BIM-based green building evaluation techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the ""green template"") for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials. Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2D takeoff), and its reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of ≤5%.

Data Sources: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and related reviews from inception to October 2014. Study Selection: We included randomized clinical trials comparing efficacy and safety between different OADs or OADs vs insulin in patients with gestational diabetes. Data Synthesis: We included 18 randomized clinical trials. Traditional and network meta-analyses were performed to compare different OADs or OADs vs insulin. Traditional meta-analyses confirmed that there was no significant difference in maternal fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin levels in patients treated with insulin, metformin, and glyburide. Compared to insulin, metformin was associated with lower maternal weight gain (weighted mean difference [WMD], -1.49 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.26 to -0.31), shorter gestational age (WMD, -0.16 wk; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03), and increased incidence of premature birth (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.48). Compared to insulin, glyburide was associated with higher neonatal birth weight (WMD, 130.68 g; 95% CI, 55.98 to 205.38), increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.59 to 4.38), and increased incidence of macrosomia (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.59 to 6.04). Network meta-analysis revealed that glyburide was associated with higher maternal weight gain, higher neonatal birth weight, increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia, and increased incidence of macrosomia than was metformin. Conclusion: Both metformin and glyburide are suitable for use in the management of gestational diabetes because of good glycemic control. However, glyburide treatment is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, high maternal weight gain, high neonatal birth weight, and macrosomia.

This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Interestingly, one of the most significant factors in building energy consumption has been reported in the area of improving building designs. However, building energy analysis (BEA) is typically conducted late in design, by energy analyst specialists. The ability to try out new ideas early in the design process in order to choose the best alternative is not ordinarily taken advantage of, due to the difficulty and expense of modeling the building and energy systems. Building information modeling (BIM) provides the user with an opportunity to explore different energy saving alternatives in the design process while avoiding the time-consuming process of re-entering all the building geometry, enclosure, and HVAC information necessary for a complete energy analysis. While significant time savings are being made by not having to create the building geometry within the simulation interface in BIM energy modeling simulation, there is a good possibility of missing, misplaced, or deformed building elements during a BIM data exchange process. This research focuses on one of the major limitations – inaccuracies through simplifications in construction/material data – and aims to improve the accuracy of energy modeling process by developing an object based approach in materials in which the energy modeler may change and expand various properties in building materials.

One of their goals is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their IFC interfaces that bind their native models to the IFC format. However, such exchanges frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid frameworks for validating a building design.

We also structured the validation processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of compliance with the IFC schema defined by the EXPRESS language, 2) semantic and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions, which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner requirements, and functional performance.

However, once an IFC file, a neutral format, is mapped with the specifications of the MVD through the export and import features of building information modeling (BIM) authoring tools, end-users find it challenging to validate the IFC file with regard to conformance to the data exchange requirements of the applied MVD. In addition, software vendors have trouble identifying the causes of errors regarding model views when they debug numerous mappings of native models to be translated into the IFC schema. To address these challenges, this research suggests a robust MVD validation process using a modularized validation platform that evaluates an IFC instance file according to diverse types of rule sets of MVDs. To extract rule templates that consist of ten types of rule logic this research employs the MVD of the precast concrete domain. Using the identified rule logic and checking structures, the MVD validation tool, which includes an object-oriented checking method and the IFC server ActiveX component, allows users to define various types of rule sets and validate an IFC instance file with regard to compliance with the syntax and semantics specified in the modularized concepts of the MVD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The building was developed in Birmingham, UK and the contract value was circa £36 million (UK Sterling, 2015). Members of the project management team (PMT) produced designs that were subsequently integrated by the main contractor into a federated building information modelling (BIM) model; at this stage 404 error clashes were evident between the positions of the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) designer's and structural designer's building compartments. The contractor deemed that these particular clashes were ‘mission critical’ as previous experience suggested that project costs could spiral uncontrollably if left unabated. Participatory action research was employed to acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of the clash incidents. Clash data accrued (in mm) was subsequently quantitatively modelled using the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Two models produced were the Log Logistic Three Parameter (3P) (using all data including outliers) and Generalized Gamma distribution (excluding outliers). Both models satisfied Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests at α 0.01 and 0.02 levels of significance. Model parameters could be used to forecast similar clashes occurring on future projects and will prove invaluable to PMT members when accurately estimating the time and resource needed to integrate BIM designs. The predictive modelling revealed that 92.98% of clashes reside within the 30–299 mm range while the most probable occurrence of a clash overlap resides in a discrete category of 100–199 mm. Further qualitative investigation is also conducted to understand why these clashes occurred and propagate ideas about how such may be mitigated. The research concludes on two important points, namely: i) BIM is not a panacea to design related construction project rework and that innovative 21st century digital technologies are hampered by 20th century management practices; and ii) improvements in clash and error mitigation reside in a better understanding of tolerances specified to alleviate the erroneous task of resolving unnecessary clashes. Future research is proposed that seeks to: automate the clash detection management, analysis and resolution process; conduct further investigative analysis of the organizational and human resource management influences impacting upon design clash propagation; and devise and validate new procedural methods to mitigate clash occurrence using a real-life project. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032384727

As the first study of its kind, this study proposes to apply the Pareto analysis to investigate BIM warnings in terms of type and frequency. Based on warning data collected from three California healthcare projects, the analysis revealed that the 15-80 rule applies across the case projects and their design phases - 15% of the warning messages are responsible for nearly 80% of the warnings. Two other noteworthy findings include the following: (1) only the schematic design phase indicates a different Pareto rule of 25-80, as well as warning pattern from other design phases due to its unique purpose; and (2) the decisions of individual design teams are a major variable in the pattern of warning types.

Time wasted by construction personnel getting the right information on megaprojects can be a substantial contributing factor. It appears that the communication on site is not cost effective, judging by the number of large project that have experienced budget overruns in the past. More importantly, as-built design documentation often fails the quality test, resulting in operational inefficiencies once the plant has been handed over from Construction to Operation Phase. Common errors during the static prefabrication, dispatch and installation processes can result in serious rework as a significant amount of construction time and budget is wasted. To minimise these problems, this paper recommends to better control the dynamic natures of construction. This study propagates a conceptual framework for assuring quality of modular construction in LNG plants by introducing a Situation Awareness construction environment with well-defined sensing and tracking technologies. While encountering situations inconsistent with plans during construction, such as time delay, fabrication errors, conflicts in terms of accessibility and constructability issues and so forth, sensors mounted in situ can discover such situations and recursively fed back to field personnel. Automation and robotics technologies, such as real-time path planning, collision detection and deviation examination utilizing as-planned building information model, can assist engineers to rapidly react with inconsistent situations and make acceptable decisions instead of partially or entirely suspending the workforce through massive reworks. In this study, we conduct a preliminary study in demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing sensory devices and automatic planning technologies. The expected results of adopting the framework are the quality-assured modular construction and execution plans during construction stages to save rework construction time and budget. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940439455

The creation and progressive update of BIM for a constructed artefact ensures that data on the structures is available and can be used throughout its lifetime. A BIM for underground applications integrates data on surface structures, such as buildings, and subsurface infrastructures, such as pipes, along with details of the surrounding ground, the associated soil and rock properties and groundwater regime into a single framework. This approach is demonstrated by applying it to trenchless construction operations, including a microtunnelling project for a new sewer. The data from this extended BIM concept can be interactively used with analysis packages to conduct risk assessments for new construction activities.

Whilst some countries lead the charge in BIM maturity level adoption, other countries are pressed to develop their own policies to minimise stagnation. This results in the unintended fragmentation of the AEC industry globally, and further enlarging the international collaboration rift within multinational firms. This article analyses key BIM standards and policies adopted in the UK based on a published 3C Meta-Standard framework. The disparity between the standards towards the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) specification goals are highlighted to recommend adjustments where necessary. A 34% gap was found, particularly in the topic areas of object connectivity and the multiple disciplinary information capture. This study forms one of three key research elements in the pursuit of developing a dynamic and autonomous BIM platform, capable of delivering parameters between stakeholders involved in complex BIM projects. © 2018, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053812300

All public-sector projects in the UK are mandated to be BIM level 2 compliant as of April 2016, and with this being a mandate, companies in the UK must understand the knowledge exchange partnership framework which will enable the organizations to successfully achieve the requirements in terms of the collaborative practices. This paper is based on a case study which focuses on the implementation of BIM Level 2 collaborative practices for a major infrastructure construction company in the UK who are Tier 1 contractors. The main aim for this paper is to investigate how the organizations are implementing collaborative practices which follow level 2 requirement. The key findings of this research suggest that with the use of BIM, organizations can improve collaboration with the right workflow implemented correctly. Implementing a BIM collaborative workflow would be enhanced by having a lot of training and raising awareness within the organization. Benefits from this research paper include making people aware of processes that need to be changed within a business to implement BIM correctly and enable the knowledge management process to become useful and provide benefits towards an organization. Results from this research will be documented in this paper and key highlight such as what challenges are being faced and how they are being overcome, these obstacles will be explored which will provide potential improvements for the future. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068656815
"Schwabe K., Dichtl M., König M., Koch C.","COBie: A Specification for the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange",2018,"Building Information Modeling: Technology Foundations and Industry Practice",2,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063561428&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-92862-3_9&partnerID=40&md5=d7ebd1a4c4656cf430bbe416cd1120ee","The Construction Operations Building information exchange (COBie) is a specification that evolved from the idea of Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM). The specification describes processes and information requirementswhich streamline the handover of specific data from the design and construction phases to the facility's operation and maintenance (FM). Until now, the handover comprises a bulk of paper or e-paper documents, but extracting FM relevant information from these documents is considered to be tedious work. Therefore, the key idea of COBie is to incrementally gather and systematically store relevant information in a digital form as soon as they emerge in the project. To realize an effective data exchange and to guarantee market neutrality, the COBie specification suggests open formats, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), SpreadsheetML or the IFC STEP format. These formats are meant for system-to-system data exchange. However, the implementation status of COBie is still at early stages. In practice, the creation of COBie deliverables is seen as problematic, due to wrong understanding of end users as well as insufficient software implementation. This ultimately lowers the acceptance among practitioners. Nevertheless, the potential benefit for the employer can be significant, if further technical and practical improvements are achieved. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.
