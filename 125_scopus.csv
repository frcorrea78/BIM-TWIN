A range of software programs is then used to combine the image and scan data.Findings - Meshing of the point cloud followed by texturing from the image data creates a framework for the creation of a 3D model. Mapping of BIM objects onto the 3D surface model is the final stage in the reverse engineering process, creating full 2D and 3D models including detail behind the object's surface concerning its methods of construction and material makeup, this new process is described as HBIM.Originality/value - The future research within this area will concentrate on three main stands. The initial strand is to attempt improve the application of geometric descriptive language to build complex parametric objects. The second stand is the development of a library of parametric based on historic data (from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books). Finally, while it is possible to plot parametric objects onto the laser scan data, there is need to identify intermediate software platforms to accelerate this stage within the HBIM framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350367834

However, its usage remains limited and scarcely adopted by the subjects in charge of conservation, mainly because of its rather complex 3D modeling requirements and a lack of shared regulatory references and guidelines as far as semantic data are concerned. In this study, we developed an HBIM methodology to support documentation, management, and planned conservation of historic buildings, with particular focus on non-geometric information: organized and coordinated storage and management of historical data, easy analysis and query, time management, flexibility, user-friendliness, and information sharing. The system is based on a standalone specific-designed database linked to the 3D model of the asset, built with BIM software, and it is highly adaptable to different assets. The database is accessible both with a developed desktop application, which acts as a plug-in for the BIM software, and through a web interface, implemented to ensure data sharing and easy usability by skilled and unskilled users. The paper describes in detail the implemented system, passing by semantic breaking down of the building, database design, as well as system architecture and capabilities. Two case studies, the Cathedral of Parma and Ducal Palace of Mantua (Italy), are then presented to show the results of the system's application. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070444006

This heterogeneity of information makes communication difficult among professionals who participate in documentation work, such as restorers, architects, engineers, archaeologists or historians, with the transfer of information being one of the biggest problems to be solved, through the creation of a methodology that favors the diffusion and accessibility to the materials coming from the investigation. The aim of the study is to create a protocol or methodology, to create a graphic database that allows the inventory of the architectural heritage in Aragon. The solution implies the development of a geometric model that allows to include and relate information related to it. The format is a HBIM model capable of incorporating information on a stratified support, with visualization, documentation and management capabilities that allow a complete view of the building to be cataloged, incorporating useful information for its conservation, restoration, protection and dissemination, as well as interoperability between tools and other systems throughout the entire life cycle of the object. In this research, we will work with the virtual platform Petrobim, a tool composed of a database and a viewer, whose purpose is the management and query of information linked to a 3D model, throughout the entire cycle building life. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

To do a specific documentation work, one has to make balance between regularity and differentiation &ndash; the opposite poles, according to the goals and specific needs of the work. This paper discuss the goals and needs of HBIM, and regards HBIM models as ""index frames"" to run the information management for heritage. Therefore regularity is preferred in HBIM and the question of ""regularized reconstruction"" are raised. Three examples are provided to demonstrate how to realize the representation of regularity in preparing HBIM models, resulting in the conclusion: 1) partial or global regularized reconstruction is available and efficient; 2) regularized reconstruction can make best use of the advantages of BIM and bypass the disadvantages; 3) to what extent the use of regularized reconstruction depends on the regularity degree of the subject. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
