PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies. © 2011 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871699277

We also describe a new topology-altering simplification method that is based on 3D morphological operators. Visually unimportant features such as tubes and holes may be eliminated from a model by the open and close morphological operators. Our simplification approach accepts polygonal models as input, scan converts these to create a volumetric description, performs topology modification, and then converts the results back to polygons.

Unfortunately, the scan-to-BIM (Building Information Model) process remains currently largely a manual process which is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach is presented for the 3D reconstruction of indoors of existing buildings from point clouds. Several segmentations are performed so that point clouds corresponding to grounds, ceilings and walls are extracted. Based on these point clouds, walls and slabs of buildings are reconstructed and described in the IFC format in order to be integrated into BIM software. The assessment of the approach is proposed thanks to two datasets. The evaluation items are the degree of automation, the transferability of the approach and the geometric quality of results of the 3D reconstruction.

However, generation of such models currently is mostly performed manually, and errors can be introduced during data collection, pre-processing, and modeling. This paper presents a method for assessing the quality of as-is BIMs generated from point cloud data by analyzing the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point cloud data. The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the depiction of the components and their spatial attributes. Major geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate potential errors introduced during data collection, processing and/or model generation. The research described in this paper provides a taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source, magnitude, and nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns. The method is validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical measurement method in a case study. The results show that the deviation analysis method is capable of identifying almost six times more errors with more than 40% time savings compared to the physical measurement method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884502984

This paper presents an approach that demonstrates the value of this integration for surface flatness control. The approach employs the Scan-vs-BIM principle of Bosché and Haas (2008) to segment TLS point clouds acquired on-site, by matching each point to the corresponding object in the BIM model. The novel approach then automatically applies two different standard flatness control techniques, Straightedge and F-Numbers, to the TLS points associated to each floor, and concludes with regard to their compliance with given tolerances. The approach is tested and validated using data from two actual concrete slabs. Results confirm the suitability of using TLS for conducting standard dimensional controls, and validate the performance of our system when compared to traditional measurement methods (in terms of both quality and efficiency). Furthermore, a novel straightedge generation method is proposed and demonstrated that enables more complete and homogeneous analysis of floor flatness for insignificant additional processing times. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900462381

However, until now, the potential of these systems has been demonstrated for tracking progress of permanent structural works only; no work has been reported yet on tracking secondary or temporary structures. For structural concrete work, temporary structures include formwork, scaffolding and shoring, while secondary components include rebar. Together, they constitute most of the earned value in concrete work. The impact of tracking secondary and temporary objects would thus be added veracity and detail to earned value calculations, and subsequently better project control and performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Two techniques for recognizing concrete construction secondary and temporary objects in TLS point clouds are implemented and tested using real-life data collected from a reinforced concrete building construction site. Both techniques represent significant innovative extensions of existing ""Scan-vs-BIM"" object recognition frameworks. Findings - The experimental results show that it is feasible to recognise secondary and temporary objects in TLS point clouds with good accuracy using the two novel techniques; but it is envisaged that superior results could be achieved by using additional cues such as colour and 3D edge information. Originality/value - This article makes valuable contributions to the problem of detecting and tracking secondary and temporary objects in 3D point clouds.

In order to interpret the data, a numerical analysis must be performed on them. Currently, data fitting techniques such as a least squares fit or a min-max fit are employed to compare the measured points to the design model. As the objectives of the various techniques differ, they often yield conflicting results. Since this discrepancy may lead to a different conclusions in the process dimensional inspection, it is critical that inspection procedures are based on well defined criteria that employ the appropriate technique to achieve the desired inspection goals. If tolerances are represented by tolerance zones, a zone fitting algorithm, introduced in this paper, provides a more consistent means of verify conformance to the tolerance zone. It determines whether a set of measured points fits into a specified tolerance zone. If the point set can fit into the zone, a rigid body transformation placing the points inside the zone is returned. The algorithm is numerically stable and addresses a general type of tolerance zone. The examples demonstrate that the zone fitting algorithm is more consistent compared to the least squares fit and the min-max fit in tolerance zone conformance verification.

As modern design methods using Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have been increasingly adopted by the AEC industry, construction quality assessment using BIM has become a challenging new task for practitioners. In the past few years, 3D as-built models for construction quality assessment have been developed using data acquisition techniques like 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry. However, certain limitations like non-affordability, requiring expertise to operate, and dependence on time-consuming processes are restricting their usage for construction quality control purposes. The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of using a new, affordable, easy to use, and faster modeling technology (Project Tango) to produce 3D as-built models for facilitating the construction quality control process. For this purpose, a construction project was chosen as a case study and three different scenarios (including interior and exterior environments) were modelled using Project Tango. A post-processing method was developed to prepare the scanned as-built models for comparison with the design BIM. The accuracy level of these as-built models were also evaluated using dimension accuracy analysis. The prepared as-built models and the design BIM were then integrated and adjusted in the Autodesk Navisworks environment to perform the quality control assessment. This assessment process includes object completeness testing and spatial deviation analyses. This research thus highlights both the advantages and limitations of Project Tango and shows that such technologies have a great potential for construction quality assessments. © 2016 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999663760

The goal is to decompose the initial data into sets of workable clusters with similar properties. Additionally, it is a key aspect in the automated procedure from point cloud data to BIM. Current approaches typically only segment a single type of primitive such as planes or cylinders. Also, current algorithms suffer from oversegmenting the data and are often sensor or scene dependent. In this work, a method is presented to automatically segment large unstructured point clouds of buildings. More specifically, the segmentation is formulated as a graph optimisation problem. First, the data is oversegmented with a greedy octree-based region growing method. The growing is conditioned on the segmentation of planes as well as smooth surfaces. Next, the candidate clusters are represented by a Conditional Random Field after which the most likely configuration of candidate clusters is computed given a set of local and contextual features. The experiments prove that the used method is a fast and reliable framework for unstructured point cloud segmentation. Processing speeds up to 40,000 points per second are recorded for the region growing. Additionally, the recall and precision of the graph clustering is approximately 80%. Overall, nearly 22% of oversegmentation is reduced by clustering the data. These clusters will be classified and used as a basis for the reconstruction of BIM models. © 2017 Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050594661

Point clouds from sensors are a direct source of information physically describing a 3D state of the recorded environment. As such, they are an exhaustive representation of the real world at every scale: 3D reality-based spatial data. Their generation is increasingly fast but processing routines and data models lack of knowledge to reason from information extraction rather than interpretation. The enhanced smart point cloud developed model allows to bring intelligence to point clouds via 3 connected meta-models while linking available knowledge and classification procedures that permits semantic injection. Interoperability drives the model adaptation to potentially many applications through specialized domain ontologies. A first prototype is implemented in Python and PostgreSQL database and allows to combine semantic and spatial concepts for basic hybrid queries on different point clouds. © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033474258

Building Information Modeling (BIM) and open standards, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have made substantial progress in improving the interoperability in recent years. However, inadequate interoperability is still inflicting an economic burden and is considered to be one of the main limiting factors for BIM adoption. This paper presents an IFC and Web-based approach and tool that enable a bi-directional conversion among structural analysis models. The approach consists of an IFC-based unified information model and a number of algorithms that help overcome the differences between the data structures and representation logics of different structural analysis technologies. A web-based platform that utilizes WebGL was developed to enable the sharing and converting of different building models. In a live case study, the testing of the approach and the platform developed demonstrated consistency in the conversion process and stability and rendering quality in the display of models over the Web browser. © ASCE 2014.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934280930

Standardized geometric quality assessment of the BIMs is needed to make them more reliable and thus reusable for future users. First, available literature on the subject is studied. Next, an initial proposal for a standardized geometric quality assessment is presented. Finally, this method is tested and evaluated with a case study. The number of specifications on BIM relating to existing buildings is limited. The Levels of Accuracy (LOA) specification of the USIBD provides definitions and suggestions regarding geometric model accuracy, but lacks a standardized assessment method. A deviation analysis is found to be dependent on (1) the used mathematical model, (2) the density of the point clouds and (3) the order of comparison. Results of the analysis can be graphical and numerical. An analysis on macro (building) and micro (BIM object) scale is necessary. On macro scale, the complete model is compared to the original point cloud and vice versa to get an overview of the general model quality. The graphical results show occluded zones and non-modeled objects respectively. Colored point clouds are derived from this analysis and integrated in the BIM. On micro scale, the relevant surface parts are extracted per BIM object and compared to the complete point cloud. Occluded zones are extracted based on a maximum deviation. What remains is classified according to the LOA specification. The numerical results are integrated in the BIM with the use of object parameters. © 2017 Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051556523

This study tests the feasibility of using IR-based scanning tablets and passive stereo vision cameras to acquire data from a construction environment based on the type of applications (such as progress monitoring, deviation detection) on a construction site. Two different off the shelf technologies: Tango tablet and ZED camera are tested during this research for developing as-built models using 3D reconstruction.

A prototypical implementation of a service-oriented architecture for classification of indoor point cloud scenes of office environments is presented, using multiview classification. The multiview classification approach is tested using a retrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model - Inception V3. The presented approach for classifying common office furniture objects (chairs, sofas and desks), contained in 3D point cloud scans, is tested and evaluated. The results show that the presented approach can classify common office furniture up to an acceptable degree of accuracy, and is suitable for quick and robust semantics approximation — based on RGB (red, green and blue color channel) cubemap images of the octree partitioned areas of the 3D point cloud scan. Additional methods for web-based 3D visualization, editing and annotation of point clouds are also discussed.

For example, Facility Management (FM) stakeholders can use deviation analysis and visualization to identify, inspect and monitor any spatial alterations both for interior and exterior building parts. Visualized instantaneous deviations can inform stakeholders of further need for investigation; they may not even have architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) expertise or access to BIM software.
