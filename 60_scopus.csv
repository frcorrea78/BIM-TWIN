With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed.

In construction industry, fatality and catastrophe investigation summary reports are available for the past accidents. In this study, text mining and natural language process (NLP) techniques are applied to analyze the construction accident reports. To be more specific, five baseline models, support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and an ensemble model are proposed to classify the causes of the accidents. Besides, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm is utilized to optimize weight of each classifier involved in the ensemble model. Experiment results show that the optimized ensemble model outperforms rest models considered in this study in terms of average weighted F1 score. The result also shows that the proposed approach is more robust to cases of low support. Moreover, an unsupervised chunking approach is proposed to extract common objects which cause the accidents based on grammar rules identified in the reports. As harmful objects are one of the major factors leading to construction accidents, identifying such objects is extremely helpful to mitigate potential risks.

BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes.

Some research assessments use the Web of Science (WoS) to identify 'high quality' journals, which are assumed to publish excellent research. The authority of WoS on journal quality stems from its selection of journals based on editorial standards and scientific impact criteria. These can be considered as universalistic criteria, meaning that they can be applied to any journal regardless of its place of publication, language, or discipline. In this article we examine the coverage by WoS of journals produced in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. We use a logistic regression to examine the probability of a journal to be covered by WoS given universalistic criteria (editorial standards and scientific impact of the journal) and particularistic criteria (country, language, and discipline of the journal). We find that it is not possible to predict the inclusion of journals in WoS only through the universalistic criteria because particularistic variables such as country of the journal, its discipline, and language are strongly related to inclusion in WoS. We conclude that using WoS as a universalistic tool for research assessment can disadvantage science published in journals with adequate editorial standards and scientific merit. We discuss the implications of these findings within the research evaluation literature, specifically for countries and disciplines not extensively covered by WoS. ©The Author(s) 2018.

The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances.

However, with the development of technological innovation, Building Information Modeling (BIM) emerged and seems to be able to address certain risks. To understand BIM applications in risk management for international construction, a state-of-the-art review is required. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the research trends and opportunities for risk management in BIM-enabled international construction by reviewing 526 peer-reviewed journal articles for the years 2007-2017. Thus five steps of bibliometric analysis were conducted based on the proposed frameworks of BIM risk management in international construction (BIM-RM-INTL). The results show that the popularization of BIM not only attracts all stakeholders' interests but also brings some risks. For example, financial factors are hard to detect and control through BIM, information loss during transmission stands out, and BIM has no unified standards and regulations for international construction. The research has mapped existing research results and their relationships for future risk management in BIM-enabled international construction. © 2018 Tsenguun Ganbat et al.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045423420

In particular, the aim is to examine the scope, value and practical implications of BIM implementation in residential projects by evaluating practitioners’ perspectives working in the Greater London Area (GLA). Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines the general status quo of BIM adoption and maturity in the UK. It then discusses the feasibility of BIM use in residential projects drawing on an online survey and complementary semi-structured interviews with building professionals. The cross-comparison between the evidence base and literature review uncovers the specific benefits, challenges and risks to BIM implementation in the house building sector. Findings: BIM is an evaluation methodology that helps the management of digital information throughout the project lifecycle. At a conceptual level, a BIM-enabled project offers quality assurance and on-time delivery, collaboration and communication improvement, visual representation and clash detection and whole lifecycle value. The findings, however, suggest that the most frequently reported benefits are related to collaboration and the blend of product (software) and process innovation, whilst lifecycle thinking and waste reduction are often overlooked. At present, there is widespread awareness on BIM but with a financial barrier to invest in developing digital capabilities, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Practical implications: The paper concludes with a critical commentary on the lack of strategic leadership in both the supply and demand side. The role of policy to streamline commercial drivers for whole lifecycle costing in procurement is endorsed to drive the change management required to address the short-term mind-set of senior management and wider fragmentation of the construction industry, also serving as a research question for further research and development in the field. Originality/value: There are relatively few studies evaluating BIM perspectives in UK residential projects. This paper explores the feasibility and “real-life” value of BIM in housing practice, drawing on views and experiences of building professionals in GLA. In particular, the research findings provide an evidence base evaluating the extent to which the house building industry has the expertise and capability to operate in a BIM environment and to comply with the Level 2 mandate and explore which of the generic barriers and drivers of BIM-readiness are more relevant to the design and construction of housing projects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066836630

However, it is not uncommon to see misuses of IFC entities during the creation of BIM. Such misuses prevent a successful automation of BIM-supported tasks because misclassification of objects in BIM can lead to significant negative consequences in downstream applications due to incorrect semantic information provided. To address this problem, the authors propose a new data-driven, iterative method that can be used to develop an algorithm to automatically classify each object in an IFC model into predefined categories. The algorithm consists of multiple subalgorithms with each subalgorithm depicting a pattern matching rule that uses inherent features of the geometric representation of an architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) object. The method was tested in an experiment in which IFC models from three different sources were collected and 1,891 AEC objects were extracted and divided into training and testing data for use. By comparing the classification results of the algorithm developed based on training data and applied to testing data with a manually developed gold standard, 84.45% recall and 85.20% precision were achieved in common building element categories, and 100% recall and precision were achieved in detailed beam categories. The sources of errors were found to be (1) different objects sharing the same geometric shape and (2) uncovered geometric shape representation in the training data. By adding locational information into consideration in addition to geometric information and making sure training data covers all geometric shape representations, 100% precision and recall can be achieved for all categories. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069052731

Design/methodology/approach: A scoping literature review was conducted to identify the fourteen barriers to implementation of BIM, which were employed to design a questionnaire survey. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, mean score, Kruskal–Wallis test, analysis of variance and multivariate techniques such as factor analysis. Findings: The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of ranking of the 14 barriers factors among the groups; however no statistically significant differences among the 14 barriers to BIM. Based on the mean score ranking results, only three (out of 14) barriers are identified as critical (mean score greater than 3.5): few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, inexistence or inadequate government policies, and high cost of implementation. The results of the one-sample t-tests show that they were statistically significant differences in 10 out of 14 barriers as follows: few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, lack of demand for use and acceptance of BIM, inadequate contractual coordination, lack of specified standards, cost of data and information sharing, technological availability issues, reluctance of other stakeholders, business and cultural changes, data and intellectual property issues, and interoperability issues. The study, through factor analysis, categorized the fourteen barriers to BIM implementation into four principal factors. The factors are: technology and business-related barriers; training and people-related barriers; cost and standards-related barriers; and process and economic-related barriers. Practical implications: The identification and assessment of the key barriers to BIM implementation would be useful for the construction professionals and other stakeholder of the construction industry with the view to advance BIM adoption in Nigeria. This could also be extended to other developing countries through considerations of the local economic conditions, given the status of BIM as being in the germinating stage of development in Africa.

It proposes the use of a “level of development and level of detail” to provide a structured approach for QSs’ integration within the BIM process for an improved implementation of 5D BIM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses semi-structured interviews with QSs from academic and industry in the UK. A total of 20 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with two groups (industrial and academic) of ten participants from the West Midlands region in the UK. The interview questions have focussed on gaining perspectives on BIM, BIM and government protocols for the QS profession, expectations and challenges when implementing 5D BIM. Findings: The findings show that BIM is perceived differently, and limitation of information obtained from the 3D models in BIM reduce the reliability of 5D BIM for QSs and implementing of 5D BIM needs an understanding of BIM workflow and information requirements.

While there have been sufficient number of successful (and unsuccessful) project level implementations of BIM in India, the maturity level of the overall industry and its constituents remains relatively low. One of the challenges faced, especially at the organizational level, is an understanding and development of the organization's BIM capabilities. These capabilities need attention in terms of their effectiveness and hierarchy of implementation in order to overcome the challenges of adoption and increasing maturity levels in BIM usage. The inability to identify crucial BIM capabilities is one of the primary barriers to ineffective BIM implementation and slow adoption in India. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics of different BIM capabilities and to understand how these capabilities can be represented as a set of interrelated elements by adopting Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) technique Accordingly, a clear understanding regarding the nature of each BIM capability is developed that will help the organizations to plan the strategic implementation of BIM on any project and gain systematic, logical and productive results. Through the three-phased study, it was concluded that BIM capabilities namely visualization, energy and environment analysis, structural analysis, MEP system modelling, constructability analysis, and BIM for as-built were found to be the independent BIM capabilities having strong driving power but weak dependence power. Facilities management is a dependent BIM capability with weak driving power but strong dependence power.

This has resulted in frequent prolonged projects, schedule delay, and consequently significant cost overruns. Existing literature has identified one of the major causes of project delays to be the lack of adequate tools or techniques to diagnose the appropriateness and sufficiency of the contract deadline proposed by project owners prior to signing the contract in the bid. As such, this paper seeks to propose appropriate or correct project durations using the research methodology of text mining for bid documents. With the emergence of 'big data' research, text mining has become an acceptable research strategy, having already been utilized in various industries including medicine, legal, and securities. In this study the scope of work (SOW), as a main part of EPC contracts is analyzed using text mining processes in a sequence of pre-processing, structuring, and normalizing. Lessons learned, collected from 13 executed offshore EPC projects, are then used to reinforce the findings from said process. For this study, critical terms (CT), representing the root of past problems, are selected from the reports of lessons learned. The occurrence of the CT in the SOW are then counted and converted to a schedule delay risk index (SDRI) for the sample projects. The measured SDRI of each sample project are then correlated to the project's actual schedule delay via regression analysis. The resultant regression model is entitled the schedule delay estimate model (SDEM) for this paper based on the case studies. Finally, the developed SDEM's accuracy is validated through its use to predict schedule delays on recently executed projects with the findings being compared with actual schedule performance. This study found the relationship between the SDRI, frequency of CTs in the SOW, and delays to be represented by the regression formula. Through assessing its performance with respect to the 13th project, said formula was found to have an accuracy of 81%. As can be seen, this study found that more CTs in the SOW leads to a higher tendency for a schedule delay. Therefore, a higher project SDRI implies that there are more issues on projects which required more time to resolve them. While the low number of projects used to develop the model reduces its generalizability, the text mining research methodology used to quantitatively estimate project schedule delay can be generalized and applied to other industries where contractual documents and information regarding lessons learned are available. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066784383

Though this technology is increasingly and rapidly adopted in advanced countries, developing countries such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) are still in the early stages of BIM adoption. Objective: This study investigates the current state of BIM technology adoption by exploring and analyzing the critical challenges and barriers to BIM technology utilization in the construction sectors. Methods: The quantitative approach is adopted via a survey questionnaire distributed to participants in the field of construction projects in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. A total of 228 questionnaires are collected and analyzed using the statistical packaging for social science software. Results: Findings show that several significant barriers negatively affect the utilization of BIM. The major barriers to BIM adoption are related to the lack of demand, lack of experts, and poor awareness of BIM benefits, which have relative importance indexes of (RII = 89.910), (RII = 88.475), and (RII = 87.130), respectively. Meanwhile, unspecified data responsibilities, difficulty of learning BIM, lack of data sharing, and sufficient current technology constitute the lowest-ranking barriers with their relative importance indexes of (RII = 71.704), (RII = 70.807), (RII = 66.413), and (RII = 65.874), respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study are highly significant and can become more helpful and interesting if further research can measure the methodologies to implement BIM technology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. © 2020 Al-Hammadi and Tian.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088983466

The Building Information Modelling (BIM) revolution has brought with it many interesting aspects in terms of changes in business processes and project practices in the construction sector. Construction firms play a crucial role in the delivery of projects; however, research shows that BIM adoption by construction organizations is still in its early stages in South Africa. Literature has shown that the South African Built Environment has not taken advantage of the BIM movement. This chapter examines the drivers and barriers to the adoption of BIM by construction companies and whether BIM capability is a key driver of BIM adoption. The study adopts a comprehensive literature review approach in achieving the study objectives. The study found through literature that the key drivers and barriers to BIM adoption include organizational readiness and client request. The study aims to develop an assessment tool for BIM capabilities within construction organizations. Further empirical studies will be required to confirm this finding that the higher the grade of a construction company on the CIDB register of companies, the higher the level of its organizational readiness to implement and adopt BIM. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Co.
