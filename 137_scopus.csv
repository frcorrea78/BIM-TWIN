This paper further defines product architecture, provides a typology of product architectures, and articulates the potential linkages between the architecture of the product and five areas of managerial importance: (1) product change; (2) product variety; (3) component standardization; (4) product performance; and (5) product development management. The paper is conceptual and foundational, synthesizing fragments from several different disciplines, including software engineering, design theory, operations management and product development management. The paper is intended to raise awareness of the far-reaching implications of the architecture of the product, to create a vocabulary for discussing and addressing the decisions and issues that are linked to product architecture, and to identify and discuss specific trade-offs associated with the choice of a product architecture. © 1995.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149321832

Different companies can independently design and produce components, suck as disk drives or operating software, and those modules will fit together into a complex and smoothly functioning product because the module makers obey a given set of design rules. Modularity in manufacturing is already common in many companies. But now a number of them are beginning to extend the approach into the design of their products and services. Modularity in design should tremendously boost the rate of innovation in many industries as it did in the computer industry. As businesses as diverse as auto manufacturing and financial services move toward modular designs, the authors say, competitive dynamics will change enormously. No longer will assemblers control the final product: suppliers of key modules will gain leverage and even take on responsibility for design rules. Companies will compete either by specifying the dominant design rules (as Microsoft does) or by producing excellent modules (as disk drive maker Quantum does). Leaders in a modular industry will control less, so they will have to watch the competitive environment closely for opportunities to link up with other module makers. They will also need to know more: engineering details that seemed trivial at the corporate level may now play a large part in strategic decisions. Leaders will also become knowledge managers internally because they will need to coordinate the efforts of development groups in order to keep them focused on the modular strategies the company is pursuing.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031227526

Quality control and assurance procedures applied in manufacturing cannot usually be readily applied in construction, where there are higher degrees of uniqueness in each project. One category of companies, industrialized housebuilders, is attempting to bridge some of the gaps between construction and manufacturing. These companies prefabricate building modules for later assembly at the building site. Since they are wholly responsible for large parts of the building process, these companies have greater opportunities to control and improve quality in a more consistent way than ordinary construction companies. Thus, it could be hypothesized that the frequency and severity of defects should be lower in industrialized housing than in ordinary construction. The aim of the study presented here is to examine this hypothesis by measuring and characterizing defects in industrialized housing. The design and manufacturing processes at two Swedish timber module prefabrication firms has been analysed through interviews, site visits and document reviews. Quality audits from three phases of the building process were compiled, analysed and categorized to provide statistical measures of defects in industrialized housing.

Most of the reports suggest the adoption of innovations including off-site manufacture and emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) to overcome the challenges facing the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of off-site manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of off-site manufacture, the benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture have been widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction. However, studies about impacts of BIM on off-site manufacture are scarce with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates the implications of BIM systems on off-site manufacture and traditional construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of BIM for off-site manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support off-site manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of off-site manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture and traditional construction is undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on off-site manufacture, off-site manufacture and BIM on traditional construction. The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on off-site manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient and one of the best ways to improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the construction industry for generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031763679

The growing popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily on the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project's lifecycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance the implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. BIM was accepted in the United States earlier than in Korea, and BIM users are expected to have a higher maturity and positive perception about utilizing BIM depending on a lengthier utilization period. This means that the mechanism for achieving acceptance of BIM in Korea differs from the mechanism in the United States. Therefore, Korea's BIM acceptance model was compared to that in the United States using structural equation modeling. The key components, including the BIM acceptance model, were identified through a literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and related theories and was consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on these components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, engineers, and facility managers) in Korea and the United States. A total 164 completed questionnaires were retrieved. Structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing was conducted using commercially-available software. The results from this study can serve as a foundation for research looking into the organizational context to further BIM acceptance in the construction industry. The comparison of the mechanism and subsequent results will serve as a guideline for developing an acceptance strategy that is suitable for Korea. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958614316

Product platforms originate from industries employing a make-to-order production strategy, e.g. the automotive industry. To test how the product platform concept is useful in engineer-to-order production strategies, a case study at two Swedish house-builders was made. Key factors that affect platform use in systems buildings were sought. The smaller company operates a supplier-led platform focusing on commonalities in process knowledge. There is less definition of the product itself to allow for distinctiveness in the product offer. The larger company has a decentralized business and operates a client-driven platform with fragmented standardization. Focus is put on creating commonality through defining the product and handling distinctiveness through an iterative design procedure. Product families were not in use at the case study companies. The companies transform standardized platform solutions into project uniqueness by using support methods. Four platform support methods emerged from the case studies: design planning, collaborative design, design optimization, and requirements iteration. The balance between commonality and distinctiveness in the platform is important to attend to in each house-building project. The engineer-to-order production strategy hinders the implementation of a fully parameterized platform. The product platform concept is therefore expanded with support methods to handle distinctiveness, i.e. project uniqueness. The product platform assets: components, processes, relationships and knowledge, are present also in platforms used in systems building. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896547485

Previous attempts to classify industrialized production systems for construction focus on dimensions such as the design process, the product technology, or the supply chain structure, but none of them acknowledge the importance of how orders are actually won in the market and that different market segments have different requirements. Using production strategy theory as a base, a matrix is developed linking market requirements, via the product offering, to the design of the production system. The matrix positions typical production systems based on their respective degrees of product standardization and volumes relative to the degree of offsite production. Similar to production systems in manufacturing, production systems for construction also deliver manufacturing outputs at different levels, indicating that the choice of production system will affect the competitiveness of the company. The applicability of the matrix is exemplified through three case illustrations of concepts for industrialized building, and these show that the matrix can be used to analyse the production systems' relative strengths and weaknesses. The matrix can also be used as a guide when developing new, or adjusting existing, production systems for industrialized building so that they will match market requirements and offer competitiveness. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896542264

Currently, larger contractor firms use BIM to a certain extent. However, BIM use by mid-sized contractor firms (that is, firms with 50–500 employees that can successfully compete with larger contractors on projects costing a maximum of 50 million Euros) is relatively unknown. Hence, the aim of the paper is to explore current use and perceived constraints and driving forces of BIM-implementation with respect to mid-sized contractors. Methods: A mixed method approach was applied, and data was collected through an interview study and a survey involving chief executive officers or their closest sub-ordinates in mid-sized contractor firms in Sweden. The survey was based on a technology-, organization-, and environment framework that is used in information systems research to study the use of inter-organizational information systems. The total population of firms in the survey corresponded to 104. The study presented the preliminary results based on 32 answers (with a 31% response rate). Results: Fifty-eight percent of the surveyed respondents stated that they had been involved in a project in which BIM was used in some manner. The most commonly used application included visualization, which also facilitates coordination and communication. The biggest perceived constraints involved partners that did not use BIM, lack of demand from clients, and the absence of internal demand in the company. With respect to the two last obstacles, significant differences existed between users and non-users. The most common perceived driving forces included the fact that BIM is perceived as a means to follow technical development and that BIM provides competitive advantages to the company. Conclusions: It is concluded that the main driver responsible for BIM-implementation is mainly determined by an individual’s subjective positive or negative evaluation of BIM, instead of external pressure from clients and partners or by the internal capacity and knowledge to use BIM. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030610313

House-builders can pre-engineer their design to different degrees, resulting in variations of the engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order, adapt-to-order, and engineer-to-stock. This variation causes different settings for the use of platforms in house-building. The aim of this research is to diversify the engineer-to-order production strategy and its consequences for platform organization by studying its use in house-building. The multiple case study on four engineering/contractor firms reports the core capabilities for engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and coordination of sales and manufacturing. Design-to-order, adapt-to-order and engineer-to stock were shown to be production strategies in use in house-building. In design-to-order platforms parts of the platform are undefined while engineer-to-stock platforms are fully predefined. Coordination between market and manufacturing is a crucial capability when engaging in platform organization. When an engineering firm and a contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the coordination capability between market and manufacturing was shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization of processes rather than products. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887048476

Also, many of the investment decisions are poorly thought through or examined. Investments decision taken during the procurement phase often merely based on intuition and rough estimations of the future costs and risks. Also, many of the traditionally used appraisal approaches have been shown inadequate in anticipating the consequences of such an investment. As a result, the investment is too often assumed to be negative since the benefits are not proper evaluated, included and weighted against the costs and risks the investment is expected to generate. Poor decision-basis does not only affect the actual decision-making in a particular project but also, in the long run, the motivation to innovate and to introduce new ICT tools and working methods into the construction industry. In view of this, a new project-oriented evaluation model is developed for the purpose to provide for a structure and a work routine to be used by a multidisciplinary project team to evaluate the implications of realizing ICT investments in construction projects. Although primarily aimed at establishing future benefits and costs the model may very well be used for follow-ups. The models' application is illustrated using a case study of a construction project using 3D and VR for coordination and evaluation. The results based on interviews and rough estimates on the ""safe side"" show that benefit of the ICT investment for the case study project was much higher compared with the cost for the project. The shift in focus from costs/benefits for the individual stakeholders to costs/benefits for the project gives a momentum to optimize the use of a new ICT tools in construction.

Product-orientation implies an alternative approach to house-building, requiring new knowledge about business models and its characteristics. The balance and fit between the main business model dimensions is specifically focused on to emphasise the importance of a holistic approach. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a case study with two leading Swedish, product-oriented house-building companies. Semi-structured interviews with company executives, document studies, site and factory visits, along with seminars at the companies are the main data sources. Theories on business models and product orientation form the theoretical foundation for the study. Findings - The case studies describe two successful companies that used end-customer knowledge to identify a target segment, develop an offering and sequentially increase control over the production and supply chain, with limited investments. This indicates that a market-based outside-in perspective is a successful approach to establish viable house-building concepts with a balance between the business model's dimensions. Practical implications - The knowledge brought forward in this study is beneficial for practitioners that can learn about product-oriented house-building and how this must be reflected in the company's business model to be successfully applied. Social implications - The study brings forward knowledge about house-building business models that can contribute to increased house-building targeted on certain customer segments. This can be beneficial in terms of decreased costs and increased volumes of new-built, high-quality homes for a variety of customers on the market. Originality/value - Business models for product-oriented house-building companies are a scarcely covered topic in previous research, and hence, this study provides knowledge of interest for both researchers and practitioners.

However approaches to BIM often lack a holistic perspective that span the whole building lifecycle. The omission of Product Lifecycle Management functions in the implementation of the BIM methodology can lead to failures in delivering the benefits of BIM to operations and diminish its value to clients with large property portfolios. In an empirical study, the paper presents an investigation into the current situation of BIM using an Australian commercial property development project. It explores implications of partial implementation for the building lifecycle. Case study findings identify deficiencies in the project environment, management shortcomings associated with the specifics of client requirements, and difficulties in the transverse use of BIM and PLM platforms due to human interface problems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919338427

However, in order to realize all of the potential efficiency gains that use of predefined components could deliver effective, interoperable information management systems are required. This article presents a multiple case study investigating the processes, products and ICT environment involved in industrialized house construction from an information management perspective, focusing on six Swedish companies that manufacture timber frame elements and one that makes precast concrete elements. The aim of the study was to identify critical aspects of information management related to industrialization in the sector. The findings show that companies aiming to enhance control and productivity by improving information management need a better understanding of the requisites for efficient industrialized construction in terms of ICT support. Changes in the perspectives of the construction companies appear to be needed in terms of not only the manufacturing processes, but also information management. Three main areas are identified that should be prioritized before any investments in ICT can be implemented effectively: formal description of the relevant processes, detailed description of the product range and its full variety, and creation of an appropriate information systems strategy.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349773435

Special attention has been given to land-based turbines for ensuring the efficient economical operation of massive hubs rising 100m above the ground, based on the idea that the bigger the turbine, the more complicated are the transportation and assembly processes. Methods: A new design of a wind turbine has several advantages compared to conventional designs; one of these advantages lies in the use of prefabricated elements, which increases efficiency. The implementation of information technology as a complement to prefabrication techniques is a further aim of this research, which seeks to improve the overall performance of the project. Consequently, Building Information Modelling is suggested as the most suitable methodology for complementing off-site techniques and reaching higher efficiency by improving design, manufacture, transportation and assembly processes. Results: This paper will present the research project “hybrid² tower for wind turbines” funded by the State of Hesse, Germany, which focuses on a new, efficient and economical design for high wind turbine towers. The new hybrid² tower is composed of a concrete tower containing prefabricated concrete quarter-circle elements, steel beams and a steel tube tower on the top. The combination of concrete and steel beams improves the static and dynamic performance of the main supporting structure. With this new design, the weight of the concrete tower is estimated to decrease by 40 % compared to a traditional full-concrete tower and, as a positive consequence, the cost of assembly (including assembly on site) is reduced. Conclusions: Due to the energy revolution, a special focus is put on the development of renewable energies, especially wind power. The steadily increasing hub heights of wind turbines means that tower structures have to be more massive. The development of the hybrid² tower by using Building Information Modeling and prefabrication techniques leads to an optimized performance and reduces transport and assembly costs. © 2016, Alvarez-Anton et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031725689

This facilitates closer relationship with customers over the lifespan of the delivered solution. However, the definition of the Digital Twin is not yet established in the companies that took part in this research that forms the basis to understand the relationship between the Digital Twins and Product-Service-Systems. The objective of this paper is to define the concepts of Digital Twin and real-time simulation, and increase understanding of the benefits and impacts that B2B companies face when applying real-time simulation, and understand where the transformation should start in Product Lifecycle Management. The case companies that participated in this research are mobile work machine manufactures, but the findings are applicable to other B2B manufacturing companies which have complex solution deliveries that are managed over the lifecycle. Results of this study show that B2B manufacturing companies are using real-time simulation to create digital twins of their real-world solutions. The companies participating in the research project create functioning digital twins but managing them is tedious and not integrated to the Product Lifecycle Management operations. First, only applying this to product development is not enough, but the management must cover the entire lifecycle of the product from Beginning (BOL), Middle (MOL) and End-of-Lifecycle (EOL). Second, the need to rethink the approach to product development and management is a key for success. Otherwise, the result is a virtual representation of the real world that is impossible to maintain at industrial level. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058533550

In the strive to identify efficient information flow with automation and configuration, the design process requires a breakdown of the product structure of a building to digitally communicate between information systems. The level of predefinitions varies between industrialized house-builders according to market position, type of building processes, and maturity in business. The client decoupling point according to the predefinitions of house-building as a product is central for how and when production information is created. Bill of materials is a breakdown structure that visualize relations and the transformation between engineering, preparation, and production processes from a life cycle perspective. A case study at eight house-building companies was chosen with the aim to identify relations between the level of predefinitions and breakdown structures. House-building platforms with a high level of predefinition on layouts, components, and interfaces show a tendency to use less time in BIM-tools for engineering work and a high level of parameters in manufacturing configuration systems to prepare for production. Meanwhile, the opposite with low levels of predefinitions on components and interfaces focus on BIM-tools for engineering work with longer lead times. An interesting outcome is those with a high level of predefinitions in interfaces but lower levels on component dimensions. These companies have the ability to position their offer to a wide market with flexibility in the engineering work and need to communicate the high levels of interface parameters for the manufacturing sequence with a breakdown of the product together with architects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072934723

Today digital tools and systems are used in both design and production to produce, deliver and instruct actors throughout the phases of a project. However, the information usually exists in different islands and manual transfers are required to keep the flow of information between IT-systems and individuals continuous. A key to improving the ability for the members in different stages of a project to work with the same information is to facilitate different views. One of the building blocks for creating bridges between the islands of information is to introduce bills of materials which can be used to organize information for different purposes. Uniting the use of building information modeling (BIM) with bills of materials (BOM) is therefore our focus in this paper. This is done in the context of industrialized house-building and the facets which it brings to the subject. The aim of this paper is to present an early endeavor into a BOM based approach for structuring information from BIM models. A demonstration tool was developed, and together with application in a case project from an industrialized house-builder, the generation of BOMs from BIM data is illustrated and discussed. The findings illustrates that we can apply different structures to the information located in our BIM models and that we can produce a BOM perspective on our products. Also, it is highlighted that we still need further studies to better understand how application of BOMs in the context of industrialized house-building is realized. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.
