Based on inputs from a variety of sensor measurements, along with historical data regarding building utilization, the SUN estimator produces occupancy estimates through the solution of a receding-horizon convex optimization problem. State-of-the-art on-line occupancy algorithms rely on indirect measurements, such as CO2 levels, or people counting sensors which are subject to significant errors and cost. The newly proposed method was evaluated via experiments in an office building environment. Estimation accuracy is shown to improve significantly when all available data is incorporated in the estimator. In particular, it is found that the average estimation error at the building level is reduced from 70% to 11% using the SUN estimator, when compared to the naive approach that relies solely on flow measurements. ©2009 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950822310

Various automated control systems of shading device and electric lighting have been widely used. However, existing lighting and shading systems typically operate independently, i.e., information is not shared, and thus system performance is not optimal. Therefore, integrated control systems have been proposed to maximize energy efficiency and user comfort. Some problems are still unaddressed. For example, the benefits of sharing control information (e.g., HVAC state and occupancy information) between the lighting and shading control systems have not been quantified; the benefits of integrated controls have not been quantified. To address these issues, improved independent and integrated control strategies were proposed by adding shared HVAC state and occupancy information. To provide a quantitative comparison of these control strategies, a co-simulation platform consisting of BCVTB, EnergyPlus and Matlab was developed to perform an in-depth quantitative study of seven control strategies (manual, independent and integrated control strategies). Simulation results for a reference office building were presented for three climate zones (Baltimore, London, Abu-Dhabi), two types of blinds (interior, exterior) and two window-to-wall ratios (66%, 100%). A dynamic occupancy model was developed from actual office occupancy data and used in the simulations. The lighting, heating and cooling energy consumption, electric demand and visual comfort of different control strategies were evaluated and compared. Overall, in most cases, integrated lighting and daylight control outperforms all other strategies in energy and visual comfort performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900824344

This study investigated whether employee ""satisfaction"" variables can predict perceived productivity, well-being and enjoyment at work, and if so, to what extent. The study also explored whether limiting employees' control over their environment could save energy without compromising employees' satisfaction and perceived productivity. Pre-occupancy and post-occupancy evaluation studies were conducted, in terms of both energy consumption and employee perceptions, to make comparisons between a company's old and current headquarters buildings, both located in the same area of London.The results showed that employees were more satisfied with their work environment at their new HQ, in general, than with that of their previous office. Also, employees' self-reported productivity, well-being and enjoyment at work improved after the move. It was revealed that the combination of employees' level of satisfaction with ""interior use of space"" and ""physical conditions"" was the best predictor of their perceived productivity, while satisfaction with ""indoor facilities"" was not a good predictor. In terms of energy performance, although the new HQ's energy consumption per m2 was significantly less than that of the previous building, there was still a gap between the refurbishment design target and the actual performance of the building. The findings suggest that this gap could be due to a number of factors, including an ineffective use of interior space, and occupants' behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883422361

WSNs have attracted a wide interest from academia and industry alike due to their diversity of applications, including home automation, smart environment, and emergency services, in various buildings. The primary goal of a WSN is to collect data sensed by sensors. These data are characteristic of being heavily noisy, exhibiting temporal and spatial correlation. In order to extract useful information from such data, as this paper will demonstrate, people need to utilise various techniques to analyse the data. Data mining is a process in which a wide spectrum of data analysis methods is used. It is applied in the paper to analyse data collected from WSNs monitoring an indoor environment in a building. A case study is given to demonstrate how data mining can be used to optimise the use of the office space in a building. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the OMG is to enable mobile sensing as a scalable approach to realize the comfort and energy savings potential of data-driven thermal management using personalized comfort models. In contrast to the universal application of static comfort criteria, data-driven models have the potential to enable flexible and continuous interpretation of thermal comfort, allowing for more personalized control of the thermal environment and minimization of the energy wasted by overheating and overcooling. Novel machine-learning algorithms are applied to synthesize subjective and physical thermal measurements into personalized comfort models which can be interpreted to determine optimal temperature setpoints based on energy and comfort goals. The feasibility of machine learning algorithms to generate useful personalized occupant comfort profiles is examined using field data from four test sites (N = 45 occupants total). The findings demonstrate that it is possible to model the thermal preferences of occupants at both the individual and zone level with data collected over a relatively small time period (2-weeks). Application of occupant-driven comfort models in annual energy simulations shows that thermal management informed by occupant feedback has the potential for significant energy savings. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015854054
