The age of the failed bridges ranged from 1 year (during construction) to 157 years, with an average of 52.5 years. The most frequent causes of bridge failures were attributed to floods and collisions. Flood and scour, with the major flood disaster in 1993, contributed to the frequency peak of bridge failures (almost 53% of all failures). Bridge overload and lateral impact forces from trucks, barges/ships, and trains constitute 20% of the total bridge failures. Other frequent principal causes are design, detailing, construction, material, and maintenance. Comparison made among three periods of similar studies (1977-1981, 1982-1988, and 1989-2000) revealed almost similar trends, with most failures occurring during the bridge's service life. Also, human-induced external events occurred frequently in all three periods, but were most dominant in the first and third periods.

The paper aims to contribute to this endeavor by presenting a novel framework that conceptualizes adaptations to climate change as actions. The framework is intended to systematically analyze the actor relations involved in adaptations and the barriers to their implementation. By combining established scientific action theories with terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in an innovative way, it can be used to clarify the notion of adaptation used in adaptation assessments. The framework's potential is illustrated by a case study on cooling water management in the river Rhine catchment and by the elucidation of some prominent concepts in adaptation research. We show that by framing adaptations as actions, the purpose of adaptations and how they tend to connect up in means-ends-chains becomes crucial. Actors can take different functional roles as exposure unit, operator and receptor of adaptation. A mismatch of these roles can lead to barriers to adaptation, of which we deduce four types: complex actor relations, missing operators, missing means and unemployed means. The case study yields a complex bundle of adaptations, and shows that the potential barriers involved are quite diverse. There is thus no blueprint solution. Although we identify entry points for adaptation, the analysis leads to a skeptical conclusion for adapting cooling water management in the whole Rhine catchment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857447207

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management team. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065500423

Interesting enhancements may be obtained by re-examining this model from the Bayesian probability logic viewpoint. Using this approach, it will be shown that the conventional regularized learning approach can be derived as a particular approximation of the Bayesian framework. Network training is only a first level where Bayesian inference can be applied to neural networks. It can also be utilized in another three levels in a hierarchical fashion: for the optimization of the regularization terms, for data-based model selection, and to evaluate the relative importance of different inputs. In this paper, after a historical overview of the probability logic approach and its application in the field of neural network models, the existing literature is revisited and reorganized according to the enunciated four levels. Then, this framework is applied to develop a two-step strategy for the assessment of the integrity of a long-suspension bridge under ambient vibrations. In the first step of the proposed strategy, the occurrence of damage is detected and the damaged portion of the bridge is identified. In the second step, the specific damaged element is recognized and the intensity of damage is evaluated.

However, more than 35% of the 300,000 railway bridges across Europe are over 100-years old, and their reliability directly impacts the reliability of the railway network. This increased demand may lead to higher risk associated with their unexpected failures, resulting safety hazards to passengers and increased whole life cycle cost of the asset. Consequently, one of the most important aspects of evaluation of the reliability of the overall railway transport system is bridge structural health monitoring, which can monitor the health state of the bridge by allowing an early detection of failures. Therefore, a fast, safe and cost-effective recovery of the optimal health state of the bridge, where the levels of element degradation or failure are maintained efficiently, can be achieved. In this article, after an introduction to the desired features of structural health monitoring, a review of the most commonly adopted bridge fault detection methods is presented. Mainly, the analysis focuses on model-based finite element updating strategies, non-model-based (data-driven) fault detection methods, such as artificial neural network, and Bayesian belief network–based structural health monitoring methods. A comparative study, which aims to discuss and compare the performance of the reviewed types of structural health monitoring methods, is then presented by analysing a short-span steel structure of a railway bridge.

In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM).

This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

The numerous strategies that can be used to mitigate these abrupt track stiffness changes rely on one of two concepts. The first concept is that of providing a gradual stiffness change, and the second is that of equalizing the track stiffness. A number of such mitigation methods have been developed and implemented over recent decades. Construction activities associated with these methods require various materials, processes, and uses of time, costs, and carbon emissions. In this study, eight of the most common techniques for railway bridge transition mitigation, including under ballast mats (UBMs), soft baseplates, under sleeper pads (USPs), rail pads, embankment treatments, transition slabs, ballast bonding, and wide sleepers, are compared. This study benchmarks the costs and carbon emissions of these eight mitigation techniques over the 50-year lifespan of a railway system subject to identical probabilities of four environmental scenarios: a control case, extremely high temperatures, extremely low temperatures, and flash flooding. This unprecedented study systemically investigates the effectiveness of the mitigation methods while considering the effects of 30 and 100 m bridge span lengths. Our results indicate that railway engineers should adopt different mitigation methods for different scenarios. The soft baseplate is the most appropriate method for a short-span bridge in the control case and the case of flash flooding, while ballast bonding is better for long-span railway bridges. Embankment treatment is recommended for both high- and low-extreme temperatures. However, its applicability is limited when the differential track stiffness is extremely high. Hence, alternatives that are 5–25% more expensive are proposed in parallel. The alternative methods include ballast bonding, and the USP and UMB methods, the latter two of which are designed for different climate scenarios. These recommendations translate novel insights from the systems thinking approach into practice and will benefit the railway industry significantly over the long term, enhancing both economic and environmental sustainability. © 2017 Setsobhonkul, Kaewunruen and Sussman.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037164380

Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and process the integration of information in a shared environment. This paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance. This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082851821

This study aims to overcome the limitations of current practices and proposes a conceptual framework to improve the reliability and efficiency of current bridge asset management practices through the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced computing and imaging technologies. As a tool for bridge inspections, BIM offers significant potential when integrated with laser scanning and keypoint-based texture recognition, which allows for the detection of such defects as cracking, corrosion or settlement in bridge components. In recent years, the construction industry has seen an increased use of BIM technology on-site to aid the construction process. However, the applications of it are deficient through the asset management phases of a project. Given the ability of BIM to house all component specific information gathered from the construction, inspection and maintenance phases, BIM is envisioned to allow emphasis to be placed on retrieving the relevant information throughout the project lifecycle, ultimately enabling engineers and bridge inspectors to make more informed decisions about the current condition of the structure.

The study into the influence of elevated temperature on compressive strength and splitting tensile strength also has been carried out using experimental data on the basis of environmental temperature and relative humidity, as well as CO2 concentration to the concrete carbonation and steel corrosion rates. The results indicate that environmental temperature, CO2 concentration, and a certain range of relative humidity play an important role in the concrete carbonation rates.

The research objective of this paper is to analyse the carbon emissions, energy consumption, and costs of the rail system which includes the structure of the track and earthwork of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR during four stages: conception stage, construction stage, operation and maintenance stage, and disposal stage. It is concluded that the majority of the carbon emissions and energy consumption of the entire rail system are from the construction stage, accounting for 64.86% and 54.31% respectively.

In this study, an online monitoring system for detecting abnormal train-induced vibration responses is developed, and the Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge is used for illustration. First, to accurately investigate the influence of different train lanes and the number of carriages on train-induced vibrations, the speed-acceleration (train speed-bridge acceleration) correlations under different loading cases are obtained using an online identification method. Then, a two-stage method for early warning of abnormal train-induced acceleration responses of the bridges is developed using wavelet packet decomposition and interval estimation theory. Finally, the early warning method for identifying abnormal train-induced transverse vibrations is presented. The results show that (1) the train lane and the number of carriages affect the speed-acceleration correlations, and the identification of loading cases is needed for the accurate monitoring of speed-acceleration correlations; (2) by using wavelet packet decomposition, the median line of speed-acceleration correlations can be optimally extracted, and the early warning thresholds for abnormal train-induced acceleration responses can be properly determined using the interval estimation theory compared with the point estimation theory; and (3) the train running parameters of the Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge are all within safe limits, but the wheel unloading rate and derailment coefficient have reached 60% of the limits due to the train-induced transverse vibrations.

Over a period of time, a railway track could experience various types of static and dynamic loading conditions, which are attributable to commercial train operations. Previous studies have established two main limit states for the design consideration of concrete sleepers: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under repeated probabilistic impact loads. Prestressed concrete has played a significant role in maintaining the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate repeated impact loads. Despite the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, their remaining lives are not deeply appreciated nor taken into account for track maintenance and renewal. The present experimental investigation was aimed at determining the residual prestressing force of railway concrete sleepers after revenue services using the dynamic relaxation technique. Fifteen sleepers were extracted from a heavy-haul rail network for testing using experimental facilities at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The structural evaluation program included quasi-static bending tests, dynamic impact tests, and tests to establish the current level of prestress in the steel wires using the dynamic relaxation technique. Two of the sleepers were evaluated for the level of prestressing forces in accordance with Australian standards.

This paper unprecedently introduces a digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station. Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the project is the highest, accounting for 78% of the total cost. However, the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is higher than the amount during the production of building materials, accounting for 67%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66% of the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73% and 17.64%, respectively. In addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life cycle cost and carbon footprint.

The workability of EFHDFRC with different proportions of the fibre was investigated by mechanical properties test. The self-sealing capacity was first measured by introducing the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test combined with the damage degree in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the regained compressive strength test and visual inspection were applied as additional measures of the self-sealing capacity.

Missing opportunities to detect a defective rail could ultimately lead to its breaking, which would magnify the repair (as well as maintenance) cost by approximately 30–35% per rail-mile. However, the performance of a pre-planned inspection schedule may be affected by disruptions in one or more element(s) of inspection such as machine/vehicle breakdown or track unavailability, which are usually unpredictable events. As part of the justification for the need to manage a disrupted inspection schedule, this paper proposes a methodology that highlights the value of rescheduling. An extensive literature search was undertaken on the rescheduling framework in order to determine the appropriate policies, strategies and methods for rail inspection. As a result, the value of rescheduling is formulated as the ratio of rescheduling cost to a change in the value of risk from a missed opportunity to repair a defective rail, i.e. late defect detection. This numerical formula demonstrates how the proposed methodology is useful for filtering out a rescheduling strategy that has (negative) value when dealing with a disrupted rail inspection schedule. The discussion portrays several potential aspects to feasibly extend the proposed methodology on a large scale of rail network. © IMechE 2018.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060245727

The prototype brings together different data and provides structure and guidance that allows port authority personnel to consider current-day vulnerabilities and future risks to a changing climate. The chapter discusses the research by McEvoy and Mullett who had identified a gap in the knowledge of small to medium-sized seaports in relation to accessing and prioritising the climate information that was available to them, and then how to operationalise this knowledge. As a result, a prototype decision-support toolkit was developed for Australian conditions, funded by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), and it is this resource that formed the platform for the Pacific region work. The prototype decision-support toolkit, climate smart seaports (CSS), which had already been built for the Australian context, was customised to meet the specific needs of seaports in the Pacific region. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Adolf K.
