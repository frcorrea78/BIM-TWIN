This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344236266

This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships.

Establishing a meaningful correspondence between shapes is often difficult because it generally requires an understanding of the structure of the shapes at both the local and global levels, and sometimes the functionality of the shape parts as well. Despite its inherent complexity, shape correspondence is a recurrent problem and an essential component of numerous geometry processing applications.

This paper particularly considers the case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find, recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds automatically. Previous research has also shown that ""Scan-vs-BIM"" systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works, thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking, automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and identification metric. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

NURBS have become a de facto standard in commercial modeling systems because of their power to represent both free-form shapes and common analytic shapes. Traditionally, however, NURBS have been viewed as purely geometric primitives, which require the designer to interactively adjust many degrees of freedom (DOFs)-control points and associated weights-to achieve desired shapes. The conventional shape modification process can often be clumsy and laborious. D-NURBS are physics-based models that incorporate mass distributions, internal deformation energies, forces, and other physical quantities into the NURBS geometric substrate. Their dynamic behavior, resulting from the numerical integration of a set of nonlinear differential equations, produces physically meaningful, hence intuitive shape variation. Consequently, a modeler can interactively sculpt complex shapes to required specifications not only in the traditional indirect fashion, by adjusting control points and setting weights, but also through direct physical manipulation, by applying simulated forces and local and global shape constraints. We use Lagrangian mechanics to formulate the equations of motion for DNURBS curves, tensor-product D-NURBS surfaces, swung D-NURBS surfaces, and triangular D-NURBS surfaces. We apply finite element analysis to reduce these equations to efficient numerical algorithms computable at interactive rates on common graphics workstations. We implement a prototype modeling environment based on D-NURBS and demonstrate that D-NURBS can bg effective tools in a wide range of CAGD applications such as shape blending, scattered data fitting, and interactive sculpting. © 1996 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030105827

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches.

To address the problems, this study presents a semi-automated approach that can obtain required parameters to create as-built BIMs for steel structures with complex connections from terrestrial laser scanning data. An algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-section fitting techniques is developed to retrieve the position and direction of each circular structural component from scanning data. An image-assisted edge point extraction algorithm is developed to effectively extract the boundaries of planar structural components. Normal-based region growing algorithm and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm are adopted to model the connections between structural components.

Inspired by recent works suggesting the possibility/opportunity of exploiting a parametric description (i.e. CAD template) of the object to be reconstructed in order to retrieve a meaningful digital representation, a novel reverse engineering approach for the reconstruction of CAD models starting from 3D mesh data is proposed. The reconstruction process is performed relying on a CAD template, whose feature tree and geometric constraints are defined according to the a priori information on the physical object. The CAD template is fitted upon the mesh data, optimizing its dimensional parameters and positioning/orientation by means of a particle swarm optimization algorithm. As a result, a parametric CAD model that perfectly fulfils the imposed geometric relations is produced and a feature tree, defining an associative modelling history, is available to the reverse engineer. The proposed implementation exploits a cooperation between a CAD software package (Siemens NX) and a numerical software environment (MATLAB). Five reconstruction tests, covering both synthetic and real-scanned mesh data, are presented and discussed in the manuscript; the results are finally compared with models generated by state of the art reverse engineering software and key aspects to be addressed in future work are hinted at. © 2017 Society for Computational Design and Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044089902

This article is a summary of the efforts of the past ten years, with a particular focus on object recognition methods. We rectify three limitations of existing review articles by describing the general structure and variations of object recognition systems and performing an extensive and quantitative comparative performance evaluation. The coverage of building component classes (i.e. semantic coverage) and recognition performances are reported in-depth and framed using a building taxonomy. Research programs demonstrate sparse semantic coverage with a clear bias towards recognizing floor, wall, ceiling, door, and window classes.

Since a building is not always constructed exactly as the design information specifies, there will be discrepancies between a BIM created in the design phase (called as-designed BIM) and the as-built conditions. Point clouds captured by laser scans can be used as a reference to update an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM (i.e., the BIM that captures the as-built information). Occlusions and construction progress prevent a laser scan performed at a single point in time to capture a complete view of building components. Progressively scanning a building during the construction phase and combining the progressively captured point cloud data together can provide the geometric information missing in the point cloud data captured previously. However, combining all point cloud data will result in large file sizes and might not always guarantee additional building component information.

Recent advances in 3D scanning technologies have made possible rapid and cost-effective acquisition of dense point clouds for 3D reconstruction. As the point clouds provide explicit 3D information, they have a much higher potential for the automation of reconstruction. However, due to the measurement principle employed by laser scanners and their limited point density, the information on sharp edges is not very reliable. It is precisely where images have superiority over point clouds. In addition images are required for visual interpretation, texture mapping, and modelling parts not visible in the point clouds. Moreover, image acquisition is more flexible, and the cost and time required for it is much lower than that of laser scanning, making their combined use essential for a cost-effective solution. These reasons led us to develop a modelling strategy that uses both images and point clouds in combination with a library of CAD primitives found in industrial scenarios represented as CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) objects. The modelling pipeline in our algorithm starts from point clouds as the main data source for automation. First of all we segment the point cloud using surface smoothness and detect simple objects like planes and cylinders using Hough Transform. This is followed by fitting of CSG objects to a combination of segments. These fitted CAD models are used as registration targets for adding more scans to the project. Additionally, by fitting the projected edges to image gradients we register images to point clouds. Once we have a registered data set, manual measurements are added to images to model missing parts and to increase the reliability of modelling for portions where laser data is known to be noisy. The final phase is similar to bundle adjustment in traditional Photogrammetry as there we estimate pose and shape parameters of all CSG objects using all image measurements and points clouds simultaneously. We name this final phase Integrated Adjustment as it integrates all available information to determine the unknown parameters. The results of applying this method to data from an industrial site are presented showing the complementary nature of point cloud and image data. An analysis of improvement in quality of 3D reconstruction shows the benefits of the adopted approach. © 2014 ISPRS. All Rights Reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951745475

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema.

Researchers have found that architectural design knowledge, such as symmetry, planarity, parallelism, and orthogonality, can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of such BIM reconstruction. Following this line of enquiry, this paper aims to develop a novel semantic registration approach for complicated scenes with repetitive, irregular-shaped objects. The approach first formulates the architectural repetition as the multimodality in mathematics. Thus, the reconstruction of repetitive objects becomes a multimodal optimization (MMO) problem of registering BIM components which have accurate geometries and rich semantics. Then, the topological information about repetition and symmetry in the reconstructed BIM is recognized and regularized for BIM semantic enrichment. A university lecture hall case, consisting of 1.9 million noisy points of 293 chairs, was selected for an experiment to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results showed that a BIM was satisfactorily created (achieving about 90% precision and recall) automatically in 926.6 s; and an even more satisfactory BIM achieved 99.3% precision and 98.0% recall with detected semantic and topological information under the minimal effort of human intervention in 228.4 s.

A plethora of approaches have been developed that, however, possess several common weaknesses: (1) heavy reliance on laborious manual or semiautomatic segmentation of raw data [e.g., two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) point clouds]; (2) unsatisfactory results for complex scenes (e.g., furniture or nonstandard indoor settings); and (3) failure to use existing resources for modeling and semantic enrichment. This paper aims to advance a novel, derivative-free optimization (DFO)-based approach that can automatically generate semantically rich as-built BIMs of complex scenes from 3D point clouds. In layman's terms, the proposed approach recognizes candidate BIM components from 3D point clouds, reassembles the components into a BIM, and registers them with semantic information from credible sources. The approach was prototyped in Autodesk Revit and tested on a noisy point cloud of office furniture scanned via a Google Tango smartphone. The results revealed that the semantically rich as-built BIM was automatically and correctly generated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.87 cm in 6.44 s, which outperformed the well-known iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The approach was then scaled up to a large auditorium scene consisting of 293 chairs to generate a satisfactory output BIM with a precision of 81.9% and a recall of 80.5%. The semantic registration approach also proved superior to existing segmentation approaches in that it is segmentation-free and capable of processing complex scenes and reusing known information.

We introduce a novel methodology for locally updating an existing 3D solid model of a complex monumental structure with the geometric information provided by a 3D mesh extracted from the digital survey of a specific sector of the monument. The methodology starts by registering the new information from the digital survey to the existing solid model of the monument.

The ROI is encapsulated and transformed into a solid space where Boolean operations are used to update the original solid model.

However, some inherent characteristics of existing buildings are complicating such a process: uncertainties, geometric irregularities, classification of heritage building components, linking sources about the real-world asset and an interdisciplinarity that may go beyond traditional Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) topics (e.g. heritage, Facility Management, sensor data and damage assessment).

The idea is to make use of parameterized CAD models whose dimensional parameters are to be optimized to match the acquired point cloud.

The optimization kernel relies on a simulated annealing algorithm to find out the best values of the parameters so as to minimize the deviations between the point cloud and the CAD models to be fitted. Both global and local fitting are possible. During the optimization process, the orientation and positioning of the CAD parts are driven by an ICP algorithm. The modifications are ensured by the batch calls to a CAD modeler which updates the models as the fitting process goes on. The modeler also handles the assembly constraints. Both single and multiple parts can be fitted, either sequentially or simultaneously. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed using both real scanned point clouds and as-scanned virtually generated point clouds which incorporate several artifacts that could appear with a real scanner. Results cover several Industry 4.0 related application scenarios, ranging from the global fitting of a single part to the update of a complete Digital Mock-Up embedding assembly constraints. The proposed approach demonstrates good capacities to help maintaining the coherence between a product/system and its digital twin. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079829840
