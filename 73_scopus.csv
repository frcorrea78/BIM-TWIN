Connecting real-time data streams from the rapidly expanding set of IoT sensor networks to the high-fidelity BIM models provides numerous applications. However, BIM and IoT integration research are still in nascent stages, there is a need to understand the current situation of BIM and IoT device integration. This paper conducts a comprehensive review with the intent to identify common emerging areas of application and common design patterns in the approach to tackling BIM-IoT device integration along with an examination of current limitations and predictions of future research directions. Altogether, 97 papers from 14 AEC related journals and databases in other industry over the last decade were reviewed. Several prevalent domains of application namely Construction Operation and Monitoring, Health & Safety Management, Construction Logistic & Management, and Facility Management were identified. The authors summarized 5 integration methods with description, examples, and discussion. These integration methods are utilizing BIM tools’ APIs and relational database, transform BIM data into a relational database using new data schema, create new query language, using semantic web technologies and hybrid approach. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and web services-based strategies for BIM and IoT integration, establishing information integration & management standards, solving interoperability issue, and cloud computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060885881

The method developed links design documentation and metered building performance to identify the technological requirements for BIM and building performance connection in a real-world example. This is supplemented by interviews with designers and operators identifying associated behavioural and methodological challenges. The practicality of implementing BIM as a performance management tool using conventional technologies is established, and recognises the need for more effective data management in both design and operation to support interlinking of these data-rich environments. Requirements for linking these environments are proposed in conjunction with feedback from building designers and operators, providing guidance for the production and sourcing of data to support building performance management using BIM. © 2017 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016504107

By extending the model into the post-occupancy period, BIM models can be used to support Facilities Management and Building Operations, and offer a consolidated interface for information regarding all aspects of building operational performance. Four key challenges must be overcome to develop BIM models suitable for Sustainable Operations management: (1) identification of critical information required to inform Operational decisions, (3) the high level of effort to create new or modify existing BIM models for the building(s), (2) the management of information transfer between real-time operations and monitoring systems and the BIM model, and (4) the handling of uncertainty based on incomplete building documentation. This paper describes the process used to addresses and overcome each of these challenges. The BIM framework and its refinement are presented along with evaluative data from a case study where a model was developed using this framework for a complex university building.

While the IoT deployment in the built environment is growing exponentially, there exists a gap in integrating these two in a systematic way through open standards and systems. From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models. The paper describes the design criteria, the system architecture, the workflow and a proof of concept with potential use cases that integrate IoT with the built environment.

Most of metro transit systems contain subways which need to be efficiently ventilated in order to maintain health and comfort of passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the thermal comfort inside subways. Subways are large facilities that require an efficient and huge ventilation system. Monitoring thermal condition for the subway is an important issue because of the variations that may occur in different spaces within the subway. These variations may affect energy consumption and the level of thermal comfort for the passengers as well. This research presents an application that utilizes wireless sensor network (WSN) and building information modeling (BIM) in order to monitor thermal conditions within a subway. BIM-based model is used to visualize the readings of air temperature and humidity levels in the subway spaces. Whereas, WSN is used to measure air temperature and humidity at different spaces within the subway via a group of transmitter nodes attached with different sensors.

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach.

Buildings produce huge volumes of data such as building information modelling (BIM), sensor (e.g. from building management systems), occupant and building maintenance data. These data can be spread across multiple disconnected systems in numerous formats, making their combined analysis difficult. The purpose of this paper is to bring these sources of data together, to provide a more complete account of a building and, consequently, a more comprehensive basis for understanding and managing its performance. Design/methodology/approach: Building data from a sample of newly constructed housing units were analysed, several properties were identified for the study and sensors deployed. A sensor agnostic platform for visualising real-time building performance data was developed. Findings: Data sources from both sensor data and qualitative questionnaire were analysed and a matrix of elements affecting building performance in areas such as energy use, comfort use, integration with technology was presented.

Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis.

The designed prototype explores the integration of commercial BIM platforms with sensor data to create a self-updating BIM model to provide real-time thermal condition monitoring based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard within an office environment. The temperature and humidity values, measured by sensors, are sent to the MySQL database server. An integrated workflow was developed to compile, standardize, integrate, and visualize monitoring data in a BIM environment to facilitate interpretation, analysis, and monitoring data exchange. The developed system was able to detect the time and location of a case study office room experiencing the levels of thermal comfort/discomfort based on the targeted thresholds. In this case, thirteen levels of thermal discomfort cases, out of forty-nine data points during the test, were detected, and the developed system was also able to generate a trigger and transmit alarms to facility managers via their wireless devices in real-time. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is a visually effective monitoring system for environmental monitoring management. The fully automated developed system is expected to provide a robust and practical tool for reliable data collection, analysis, and visualization to facilitate intelligent monitoring of the thermal condition in buildings and help decision-makers make faster and better decisions, which may help in maintaining the level of occupants’ thermal comfort to a satisfactory level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096837952

The mass construction of apartment neighborhoods during a period of rapid economic growth (1970-1997) involved the minimization of material use and quality, as well as industrialized construction processes. Accordingly, apartment buildings require essential renovation after only 20 years of operation. This study focuses on the improvement of thermal comfort for the renovation of an exemplary apartment building based on an integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric software framework. The existing apartment was reconstructed with BIM software, and the virtual model was utilized for a parametric building energy simulation to calculate the thermal comfort condition of occupants during the entire year. The thermal comfort analysis results defined the criteria for the development of an enhanced building envelope system characterized by modular panels. The parametric energy simulation was executed for the renovated apartment condition with the enhanced envelope system, and the thermal comfort improvements were quantified by comparing the results for the apartment condition before and after renovation. This study aims to provide the tools and criteria for the comfort analysis of apartment occupants, as well as propose sustainable solutions for the improvement of thermal comfort in aged buildings with similar conditions, internal distribution, and construction components. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073910560

One alternative to achieve better energy performance in existing houses is retrofit. However, there are difficulties associated with retrofitting social housing. It is currently challenging to compare scenarios (retrofit options) considering costs, potential energy efficiency gains, and at the same time minimising disruption to users. This paper presents a Building Information Modelling (BIM) protocol aimed to support decision making by social housing owners. It adopts BIM to simulate alternative retrofit options, considering: (a) potential reductions in energy consumption, (b) 4D BIM for retrofit planning and reduction of users' disruption and (c) simulation of costs. A what-if scenario matrix is proposed to support decision making in the selection of social housing retrofit solutions, according to client and users' needs. A case study of the retrofit of a mid-terrace house is presented to demonstrate the workflow. The main output of the work is the BIM protocol, which can support client decision making in diverse social housing retrofit projects, considering all three elements (energy simulation, planning for reduced disruption and cost estimation) in an integrated fashion. Such an integrated approach enables clients to make better informed decisions considering diverse social housing retrofit options through a simple process using readily available BIM technology. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066924059

Importantly, in smart buildings smart components that are enabled with sensing and actuation need to be modeled accurately within the BIM model. This data representation needs to include multiple status of the smart component based on their performance to guide the design and construction process. However, currently there is not a clear methodology or guideline on how to embed smart components in the BIM model. Visualization techniques have been developed based on CAD technology to integrate smart components in the building model but these techniques have not been applied to BIM environment. To accurately model smart components, the component must be more than a single status representation and must contain complete and accurate dynamic data of the smart component. In this research, data properties, visualization techniques, and categorization of smart components is investigated. Then, through an experimental investigation, nine smart components across five building disciplines are modeled and embedded in a BIM model of a smart space. The model includes parameters that facilitate the data representation of the smart components. Data properties, data organization, and simulation of the smart component within the building model is explained. Challenges and future research is discussed. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.
