In this work we extend the technique to explicitly incorporate the points as interpolation constraints. The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions. © 2013 ACM.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879498472

Two types of approaches have been pursued: 3D tracking of homologous parts of the surface to compute a displacement field, and distance calculation between two point clouds when homologous parts cannot be defined. This study deals with the second approach, typical of natural surfaces altered by erosion, sedimentation or vegetation between surveys. Current comparison methods are based on a closest point distance or require at least one of the PC to be meshed with severe limitations when surfaces present roughness elements at all scales. To solve these issues, we introduce a new algorithm performing a direct comparison of point clouds in 3D. The method has two steps: (1) surface normal estimation and orientation in 3D at a scale consistent with the local surface roughness; (2) measurement of the mean surface change along the normal direction with explicit calculation of a local confidence interval. Comparison with existing methods demonstrates the higher accuracy of our approach, as well as an easier workflow due to the absence of surface meshing or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation. Application of the method in a rapidly eroding, meandering bedrock river (Rangitikei River canyon) illustrates its ability to handle 3D differences in complex situations (flat and vertical surfaces on the same scene), to reduce uncertainty related to point cloud roughness by local averaging and to generate 3D maps of uncertainty levels. We also demonstrate that for high precision survey scanners, the total error budget on change detection is dominated by the point clouds registration error and the surface roughness. Combined with mm-range local georeferencing of the point clouds, levels of detection down to 6. mm (defined at 95% confidence) can be routinely attained in situ over ranges of 50. m. We provide evidence for the self-affine behaviour of different surfaces. We show how this impacts the calculation of normal vectors and demonstrate the scaling behaviour of the level of change detection. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available open source software package. It operates in complex 3D cases and can also be used as a simpler and more robust alternative to DEM differencing for the 2D cases. © 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The next stage involves the design and construction of a parametric library of objects, which are based on the manuscripts ranging from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books. In building parametric objects, the problem of file format and exchange of data has been overcome within the BIM ArchiCAD software platform by using geometric descriptive language (GDL).

Although close-range photogrammetry has not been as popular in bridge engineering as in other fields, the investigations that have been conducted demonstrate the potential of this technique. The availability of inexpensive, off-the-shelf digital cameras and soft-copy, photogrammetry software systems has made close-range photogrammetry much more feasible and affordable for bridge engineering applications. To increase awareness of the use of this powerful non-contact, non-destructive technique in the bridge engineering field, this paper presents a literature review on the basic development of close-range photogrammetry and briefly describes previous work related to bridge deformation and geometry measurement; structural test monitoring; and historic documentation. The major aspects of photogrammetry bridge measurement are covered starting from the late 1970s and include a description of measurement types, cameras, targets, network control, and software. It is shown that early applications featured the use of metric cameras (specially designed for photogrammetry purposes), diffuse targets (non-retroreflective), stereoscopic photogrammetry network layout, and analog analytical tools, which transformed over time to the use of non-metric cameras, retro-reflective targets, highly convergent network layout, and digital computerized analytical tools. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on these point clouds, walls and slabs of buildings are reconstructed and described in the IFC format in order to be integrated into BIM software. The assessment of the approach is proposed thanks to two datasets. The evaluation items are the degree of automation, the transferability of the approach and the geometric quality of results of the 3D reconstruction.

Although recent developments in Building Information Modeling have introduced advanced simulation capabilities, the numerical characterization of historic buildings is still a challenging task for the lack of reliable procedures for structural simulation. This paper presents an innovative two-step methodology (Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM) able to convert a historic BIM into a finite element model for structural simulation. The generation of the BIM (Cloud-to-BIM) is carried out with an accurate survey that integrates geometrical aspects, diagnostic analysis based on destructive and non-destructive inspections, material information, element interconnections, and architectural and structural considerations. The BIM is then turned into a finite element model (BIM-to-FEM) with a geometric rationalization which preserves irregularities and anomalies, such as verticality deviation and variable thickness. After setting material properties, loads, and boundary conditions, the structural simulation is run with a detailed model that respects the uniqueness and authenticity of the historic building, without the typical excessive geometric simplifications of the shape. A real case study is illustrated and discussed to prove that a rigorous Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM workflow allows the generation of an accurate historic BIM from a set of laser scanning point clouds.

However, generation of such models currently is mostly performed manually, and errors can be introduced during data collection, pre-processing, and modeling. This paper presents a method for assessing the quality of as-is BIMs generated from point cloud data by analyzing the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point cloud data. The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the depiction of the components and their spatial attributes. Major geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate potential errors introduced during data collection, processing and/or model generation. The research described in this paper provides a taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source, magnitude, and nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns. The method is validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical measurement method in a case study.

In recent years, various scanning technologies were applied with different success. The general finding is that a higher quality of the point cloud leads to improved monitoring results. Most published works in the relevant area recognise density and accuracy as the main quality parameters of a point cloud. Data quality has been addressed in various ways, by defining arbitrary levels of quality parameters, by evaluating the quality parameters of a point cloud, and by defining parameters of a scanning plan in order to achieve a desired level of quality. However, the relation between the levels of point cloud quality and the success of Scan-vs-BIM element identification is still an open question. This paper presents results of a research in which we defined a more accurate and applicable metric for evaluation of the quality of a point cloud for construction progress monitoring using a Scan-vs-BIM method. The proposed methodology includes the definition of building element classes and the definition of point cloud quality parameters, which have been selected by observing the most significant criteria that influence the success of building element identification. Using a test BIM, around hundred point clouds have been generated with combinations of influencing parameter values. A statistical method was applied to determine the point cloud quality criteria for assuring correct identification of each class of elements. The quality criteria were then validated using three different scanning methods. Results show that the defined quality criteria can be effectively applied in deciding on the appropriate scanning methodology for successful Scan-vs-BIM identification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030318234

EniServizi, aware of the BIM potential role in the complex building and infrastructure domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM based on laser scanner and photogrammetric surveying to address decision-making processes among the different actors involved in the preservation process. The Basilica of Collemaggio has been re-opened to the public on December 2017. This paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in relation to both positive and critical aspects relating HBIM feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging restoration and preservation field. The theoretical and practical HBIM approach here tackled overcomes the current BIM logic based on the sequential process adopted by the AIA and NBS Level of Development (LOD), characterized by a simple-to-complex-detailing process, working in the new construction domain and generally following the conceptualizing phase, the preliminary design, the executive design, the construction phase till to the facility management. A complex-mixed LOD approach, able to entail the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each component and to get the maximum degree of knowledge, has been experimented in order to derive informed decisions in terms of preservation, restoration and management since the starting phases of the architectural design. To this aim, a Level of Geometry (LOG) coherent to the Level of Accuracy gained by the high-resolution surveys has been adapted to the specificity of the restoration process of a historic monument and is here proposed through different Grade of Generation (GOG) protocols developed in the object modelling to support the preliminary and definitive design proposal of the conservation plan of the Basilica. Particularly, a NURBS-based parametric generative modelling process (GOG9-10) is here proposed in order to get models “BIM abled” to describe the complex geometry and to match the related information. Specific Level of Information (LOI) has been introduced to support the preservation process, to document the as-built and the management of the building after the intervention, moving HBIM toward multi-actor domain. Given the effort required by such approach, obtaining a cost-effective HBIM modelling embodying the complexity of each damaged element as acquired by the surveys (i.e. walls, pillars, vaults, beams) represents a challenging issue. The result of the overall process aims to contribute in lowering the initial HBIM modelling costs by deploying a sustainable complexity delivering protocols and specification and by boosting at the same time an interoperable cooperative HBIM habit among multi-actors across all the phases, spreading its usability after the restoration process. On the lesson learnt, the process of updating the current Codification criteria (UNI11337-2009) has been started with a draft proposal stimulating the debate for the future of HBIM adoption in the case of restoration, preservation and maintenance (UNI11337-2017): in the conviction that transferring the HBIM richness into the Life Cycle Management process will allow multi-actors to take in account the knowledge and information gained during the restoration, integrating the as-built updating and keeping updated the monument monitoring during the time being. © 2018, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055423071

Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end, this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps: (1) data capturing and processing, (2) object recognition, and (3) as-is BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed. Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are identified.

In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format.

The point of creating a BIM model for an existing building is to produce accurate information related to the building, including its physical and functional characteristics, geometry and inner spatial relationships. The case study provides a critical appraisal of the process of both collecting accurate survey data using a terrestrial laser scanner combined with a total station and creating a BIM model as the basis of a digital management model.

However, the integration of these diverse data into a unique information model capable of fully describing the building conservation state, as well as integrating future data, is still an open issue within the Cultural Heritage community. It is of paramount importance to correlate these data and spatialize them in order to provide scientists in charge of our heritage with a practical and easy means to explore the information used during their assessment, as well as a way to record their scientific observation and share them within their community of practice. In order to resolve this issue, we developed a correlation pipeline for the integration of the semantic, spatial and morphological dimension of a built heritage. The pipeline uses an ontological model for recording and integrating multidisciplinary observations of the conservation state into structural data spatialized into a semantic-aware 3D representation.

While these data sets contain rich geometric information, they bring unique challenges related to geometric information retrieval. This paper describes a case study to show the necessity and potential value of automating the manual data processing workflows being executed for extracting geometric data items (surveying goals) from 3D point clouds, and presents an approach for formalizing these workflows to enable such automation. We analyzed manual procedures of taking measurements on 3D point clouds and as-built models for obtaining bridge inspection related surveying goals, synthesized and categorized all data processing operations into nine generic operations. These nine categories of operations can be formalized using < operator, inputs, output, parameters, constraints> tuples. Using these tuples, we formalized an operation library and workflow construction mechanisms for enabling inspectors to semi-automatically construct executable workflows. This formalism also incorporates several mechanisms for facilitating extensions to the existing operation library to accommodate additional surveying goals that have not been covered. The developed approach is validated for its generality to support workflows needed for all surveying goals required by the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) program, and for its extensibility to support workflows needed to support a variety of other surveying goals identified in the Architecture/Engineering/Construction domain. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the TLS- and SfM-based morphologies are qualitatively the same, and the relative differences are lower than 10%-20% under the condition that the viewpoint positions (VPs) are optimal. Also, the overall geometries are correctly described by both the techniques.

Phase based laser scanners can measure distances to object surfaces with a precision in the order of a few millimeters at ranges between 1 and 80 m. However, the quality of a laser scanner end-product, like a 3D model, is influenced by many different parameters, especially the relative object surface orientation and the local point cloud density. This paper introduces the notion of point cloud quality. The obtained point cloud is first segmented using a planar feature extraction segmentation. Each segment is subdivided into smaller patches of 20 × 20 cm. For each patch a patch quality parameter is determined, which incorporates the local point density and local point quality. By averaging the patch quality over the complete point cloud, a point cloud quality is derived. This paper demonstrates this approach in practice by comparing two scans of the same test room obtained from different stand-points. As a result, it is shown and analyzed that by simply moving the scanner by two meters, the quality of the point cloud can be improved by 25 %.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996758931

The current HBIM project mostly employs the scan-to-BIM process to manually create the geometric model from the point cloud. This paper explains how it is possible to shape from the mesh geometry with reduced human involvement during the modelling process. Aiming at unbuilt heritage, two case studies are handled in this study, including a ruined Roman stone architectural and a severely damaged abbey. The pipeline consists of solid element modelling based on documentation data using Autodesk Revit, a common BIM platform, and the successive modelling from these geometric primitives using Autodesk Dynamo, a visual programming built-in plugin tool in Revit. The BIM-based reconstruction enriches the classic visual model from computer graphics approaches with measurement, semantic and additional information. Dynamo is used to develop a semi-automated function to reduce the manual process, which builds the final BIM model from segmented parametric elements directly. The level of detail (LoD) of the final models is dramatically relevant with the manual involvement in the element creation. The proposed outline also presents two potential issues in the ongoing work: combining the ontology semantics with the parametric BIM model, and introducing the proposed pipeline into the as-built HBIM process. © Authors 2018.

This paper aims to validate close-range Structure from Motion (SfM) for heritage by analyzing the point density and the 3D mesh geometry in comparison with Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS). The accuracy of the results and the geometry mainly depends on the processing performed on the point set. Therefore, these two variables are significant in the 3D reconstruction of heritage buildings. This paper focuses on a 15th century case study in Seville (Spain): the main façade of Casa de Pilatos. Ten SfM surveys were carried out varying the capture method (simple and stereoscopic) and the number of shots, distances, orientation and procedure. A mathematical analysis is proposed to verify the point spatial resolution and the accuracy of the 3D model geometry by section profiles in SfM data. SfM achieved acceptable accuracy levels to generate 3D meshes despite disordered shots and the number of images.

However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research.

TeamWork-HBIM acts as a database for movable assets, i.e., parametric objects (GDL) with graphical and semantic information, which are valid for recording, inventory and cataloguing processes. Thus, heritage properties were created and used to create recording and inventory sheets related to movable assets. Consequently, a parametric object was edited in the HBIM project, so a new category called “Heritage Furniture” was available. Data from the monitoring of the artistic asset were included in that category. In addition, the specialist technicians from the TeamWork-HBIM team catalogued a dataset related to artistic, historical and conservation properties. Another advantage of the system was the reliability of the structure of the HBIM project, which was based on the actual geometry of the building provided by the point clouds.

Many HBIM (Heritage Building Information Modeling) applications lead to the systematization of survey data, even though a univocal working method is not yet clearly defined. This research considers the decomposition of architecture, based on structured criteria, and its reconstruction, through ideal models, as the main moments of the HBIM process. This hypothesis is verified through a procedure that links the survey 3D data with the characteristics of the ideal HBIM model, which allows a continuous comparison between the project model and as-built. The research provides for the setting up of a general methodology that, according to a growing approach to the complexity of the analyzed buildings, compares the process followed on two architectural structures. The study analyzes some important HBIM issues: The relationship between the semantic modeling and the surfaces’ continuity of architectural heritage; the relationship between the elements standardization, geometric irregularities, and material heterogeneity; the reliability of the built models; and the evaluation of the gap between an ideal model and the objective accuracy of surveying. © 2019 by the author.

Current platforms manage the information as data centres (i.e. databases) related to graphical representations located in 3D parametric models. Today, these new technologies are nowadays being incorporated in heritage assets. This paper aims to establish a methodology, based on these efficient platforms, for studying built heritage, including historical and construction aspects by adding the chronology of those interventions made in the historic building. This case study is focused on the Palace of the Children of Don Gome, a historic building located in the city of Andújar, in Jaén (Spain). The interest of this case study lies in the historic innovations and areas added to this palace. Likewise, the collection and manipulation of the graphic information and data related to the interventions have been based on an interoperable 3D graphic model, which allows users to include all the related documentation from different disciplines associated with the conservation and heritage restoration processes. In this paper, the construction process carried out during the last restoration of the building is studied. Specifically, it analyses the last building intervention in 1989, in particular an area of the coffered ceiling slab in the northern nave, located on the first floor. Within this model, all the elements that constitute the roof of the tower, mudwall walls, slabs and coffered ceilings of the northern nave have been studied, using photogrammetry for data acquisition and 3D modelling, and these data are included in a 3D digital model of the building generated using ArchiCAD software. Moreover, the system will be used to improve the management of the information obtained during heritage maintenance, creating a record of the whole building life cycle. As well as the historical documentation and graphical research, and the analysis of the procedures carried out during the last refurbishment of the building, new building construction system proposals have arisen which have been modelled to fulfil the Level Of Development (LOD) 300. Further analysis of these construction solutions used provides knowledge of how large 16th century palaces were built, and the kind of restoration conducted by architects at the end of the 20th century. The results obtained show how current BIM platforms are able to record construction and evolutionary aspects of a building's history, by identifying all the original elements and classifying them before their demolition. Also, by making a detailed inventory of the whole coffered ceiling in which the position and the temporal order (original - later addition) of the elements are included, it is possible to virtually replace those elements in their original positions, reducing the visual impact of the intervention. On the other hand, multiple errors in projects based on graphical systems of representation, mainly Computer-Aided Design (CAD), may derive from contradictions in the official sources consulted, such as the plans of the cadastre, the city council, and those produced through manual measurement procedures. However, in this paper, real graphical documentation has been generated using specific 3D surveying techniques for capturing geometry and accurate measurements, as well as by utilising the BIM system. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.El presente documento pretende exponer una metodología eficiente para el estudio del patrimonio construido que englobe aspectos históricos y constructivos al incorporar la cronología de las intervenciones realizadas en el edificio histórico. El caso de estudio se centra en el Palacio de los niños de Don Gome, un edificio histórico situado en la localidad de Andújar, en Jaén (España). La recopilación y manipulación de la información gráfica y de datos relacionados se sustentará en un modelo gráfico 3D interoperable, que permita una gestión de toda la documentación integrada en el mismo desde todos los campos disciplinares relacionados con el proceso de conservación y rehabilitación patrimonial. Además, el sistema permitirá ampliar la gestión de la información que se obtiene en el mantenimiento del patrimonio, cumpliendo así su ciclo de vida. En el trabajo expuesto se analiza el proceso constructivo llevado a cabo en la última rehabilitación del edificio. En concreto, se analiza la fase realizada en la última intervención del edificio en el año 1989 y en una zona puntual del artesonado del forjado de la Nave Norte, situada en la primera planta. Estos datos se incluyen en un modelo digital 3D de información del edificio generado mediante el software ArchiCAD. Dentro del propio modelo se han estudiado en profundidad todos los elementos que conforman la cubierta de la torre, los muros de tapial, forjados, cubiertas y artesonados de la nave norte, empleando en esta última zona la fotogrametría como técnica de adquisición de datos y reproducción en 3D. Se lleva a cabo una clasificación tipológica de los elementos singulares de los canes originales del siglo XVI en el modelo 3D y se implanta un nuevo procedimiento de marcadores de revisión que identifican tanto las omisiones del proyecto como las intervenciones a lo largo de la historia del edificio patrimonial en el Proyecto HBIM. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064597717

Nevertheless, the development of user-oriented calibration approaches is still an active topic of research. The calibration fields for the target-based self-calibration of TLSs described in the literature are based on the quasi-random distribution of a high number of targets, and they rely on heavy redundancy. This redundancy assures highly accurate calibration results, however, with the price of reduced efficiency. In contrast, this work follows the design, implementation, and validation of a user-oriented, cost-efficient calibration field intended for TLS calibration prior to measurement campaigns. Multiple goals and constraints are placed upon the design of the calibration field, such as comprehensive calibration for high-end panoramic TLSs considering all relevant mechanical misalignments, delivering stable and reusable calibration parameters, increasing calibration efficiency by minimizing calibration-field assembly, measurement acquisition and processing time through reducing the number of targets and scanner stations, as well as estimating calibration parameters with predefined quality criteria. The calibration field design was derived through a series of simulation experiments and it was compared with the current state of the art. The simulations indicate comparable calibration results, with eight times smaller number of targets (14 instead of 120). The implemented calibration field was tested on a range of instruments, successfully improving the measurement quality, both in situ and in the subsequent applications. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079497120

Then, different modeling strategies allow the generation of 3D models in various formats, such as meshes that interpolates the acquired point cloud, NURBS-based reconstructions based on manual, semi-automated, or automated procedures, and parametric objects for Building Information Modeling. This paper proposes a novel method that reconstructs the visible surface of a vault using neural networks. It is based on the assumption that vaults are not irregular free-form objects, but they can be reconstructed by mathematical functions calculated from the acquired point clouds. The proposed approach uses the point cloud to train a neural network that approximates vault surface. The achieved solution is not only able to consider the basic geometry of the vault, but also its irregularities that cannot be neglected in the case of accurate and detailed modeling projects of historical vaults. Considerations on the approximation capabilities of neural networks are illustrated and discussed along with the advantages of creating a mathematical representation encapsulated into a function. © Authors 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065440524

Despite the continuous progress in research, the modeling processes of complex construction elements, typical of historical architectures, always require a certain attention and care that involve considerable investments in terms of both resources and time. In this paper we present the first results of an ongoing research aimed at considering possible methods that can allow a simplification of the modeling processes of elements of historical architectures in the BIM environment. In particular, the research aims to explore the possibilities offered by the algorithmic modeling of complex construction elements. In the study of historical architecture, an enough recurring theme concerns those elements that can be traced back to the principles of architectural orders. In the survey of historical architecture, a quite recurring case study concerns those elements or parts of building ruled by the principles of architectural orders. One of the first elements taken into consideration was that of the column that, in its articulation in base, shaft and capital, offers three different levels of complexity of the modeling process very suitable for the research path. Starting with a collection of data acquired from digital photogrammetric modeling, we considered a initial set of different case studies that allowed us to conduct a first working hypothesis by embracing a quite wide range of possible variations starting from a basic column. © Authors 2019.
