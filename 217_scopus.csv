They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s.

This study aims to overcome the limitations of current practices and proposes a conceptual framework to improve the reliability and efficiency of current bridge asset management practices through the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced computing and imaging technologies. As a tool for bridge inspections, BIM offers significant potential when integrated with laser scanning and keypoint-based texture recognition, which allows for the detection of such defects as cracking, corrosion or settlement in bridge components. In recent years, the construction industry has seen an increased use of BIM technology on-site to aid the construction process. However, the applications of it are deficient through the asset management phases of a project. Given the ability of BIM to house all component specific information gathered from the construction, inspection and maintenance phases, BIM is envisioned to allow emphasis to be placed on retrieving the relevant information throughout the project lifecycle, ultimately enabling engineers and bridge inspectors to make more informed decisions about the current condition of the structure. Using BIM as the focal point for information collection throughout the project lifecycle, findings from advanced imaging and data processing are proposed to be stored within the model for recall at future bridge assessments. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990865970

This study provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the state-of-the-art latest research and industry standards development that impact upon BIM and asset management within the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase. However, BIM is not always enough in whole-life cycle asset management, especially in the O&M phase. Therefore, a framework for future development of smart asset management is proposed, integrating the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. The findings will contribute to inspiring novel research ideas and promote widespread adoption of smart DT-enabled asset management within the O&M phase. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070604150

Furthermore, most experts now agree that conservation management of heritage places based on a common understanding of their cultural values is essential to address all the particularities of their contexts. Recently, significant research has demonstrated the potential of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) for the collaborative data management in conjunction with conservation projects. The recent development of HBIM web platforms illustrates the value of strengthening the link between the digital model and the physical realm of heritage assets. This paper advocates the application of Digital Twin's (DT) principles, using HBIM models as a digital replica, to support the preventive conservation of heritage places. Based on an extensive literature review, a comprehensive framework that integrates the DT into the management plan process for the preventive conservation of built heritage is proposed. Several recommendations for its implementation are finally discussed, such as the identification of tangible features of significance, the threats associated with their integrity and the corresponding mitigation strategies, with particular emphasis on the value assessment process. The result is a data model for structuring information on preventive conservation strategies. This framework provides the basis for future implementation and demonstrates the need for a DT approach in this context. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083324709

It is therefore essential that they are designed, constructed and maintained properly to adapt to changing conditions of use and climate-driven events. With the rapid development in capability of collecting bridge monitoring data, a data challenge emerges due to insufficient capability in managing, processing and interpreting large monitoring datasets to extract useful information which is of practical value to the industry. One emerging area of research which focuses on addressing this challenge is the creation of 'digital twins' for bridges. A digital twin serves as a virtual representation of the physical infrastructure (i.e. the physical twin), which can be updated in near real time as new data is collected, provide feedback into the physical twin and perform 'what-if scenarios for assessing asset risks and predicting asset performance. This paper presents and broadly discusses two years of exploratory study towards creating a digital twin of bridges for structural health monitoring purposes. In particular, it has involved an interdisciplinary collaboration between civil engineers at the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC) and statisticians at the Alan Turing Institute (ATI), using two monitored railway bridges in Staffordshire, UK as a case study. Four areas of research were investigated: (i) real-time data management using BIM, (ii) physics-based approaches, (iii) data-driven approaches, and (iv) data-centric engineering approaches (i.e. synthesis of physics-based and data-driven approaches). A framework for creating a digital twin of bridges, particularly for structural health monitoring purposes, is proposed and briefly discussed. © International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring.

Design/methodology/approach: A new framework that implements camera-based unmanned aerial systems (UASs) with computer vision algorithms to collect and process inspection data, and Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) to store and manage all related inspection information is proposed. An illustrative case study was performed using the proposed framework to test its feasibility and efficiency. Findings: The test results of the proposed framework on an existing bridge verified that: high-resolution images captured by an UAS enable to visually identify different types of defects, and detect cracks automatically using computer vision algorithms, the use of BrIM enable assigning defect information on individual model elements, manage all bridge data in a single model across the bridge life cycle. The evaluation by bridge inspectors from 12 states across the USA demonstrated that all of the identified problems, except for being subjective, can be improved using the proposed framework. Practical implications: The proposed framework enables to: collect and document accurate bridge inspection data, reduce the number of site visits and avoid data overload and facilitate a more efficient, cost-effective and safer bridge inspection process. Originality/value: This paper contributes a novel and systematic framework for the collection and integration of inspection data for bridge inspection and management. The findings from the case study suggest that the proposed framework should help improve current bridge inspection and management practice. Furthermore, the difficulties experienced during the implementation are evaluated, which should be helpful for improving the efficiency and the degree of automation of the proposed framework further. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076888281

The data acquired by these systems could lead to reductions in construction, operational, and maintenance costs and improved performance and quality by enabling informed decision making. Nevertheless, the data as outputted by the systems is of little use and value. First, it needs to be processed and put into geometric context within the built-Asset, which simplifies the interpretation and analysis of the data. This supports informed decision making that leads to effective actions. This paper presents an overview of an approach to model structural performance monitoring systems and to include and visualise sensor data on BIM models in a manner that facilitates decision making. This paper addresses aspects related to (1) interoperability and standards for data modelling; (2) processing and management of sensor data on BIM models; and (3) visualisation of sensor data directly on the BIM model. A precast concrete bridge, in Staffordshire, UK, has been used as case study. It has been installed with two types of fibre optic systems to monitor the manufacturing process of its pre-stressed beams. The paper shows that BEM provisions to support structural performance monitoring tasks are not sufficient yet. It also showcases that by including and visualising monitoring data directly on BIM models it gains geometrical context within the built asset. This facilitates its analysis and increases its value. © The authors and ICE Publishing: All rights reserved, 2016.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987678234

The drawing of these representations is a time-consuming task, accomplished by manual work by skilled operators who often rely on in-situ analysis and on pictures. In this project three-dimensional an automated method for the condition survey of reinforced concrete spalling has been developed. To realize the automated image-based survey it has been exploited the Mask R-CNN neural network. The training phase has been executed over the original model, providing new examples of images with concrete cover detachments. At the same time, a photogrammetry process involved the images, in order to obtain a point cloud which acts as a reference to a Scan to BIM process. The BIM environment serves as a collector of information, as it owns the ontology to recreate entities and relationships. The information as extracted by neural network and photogrammetry serve to create the pictures which depict the concrete spalling in the BIM environment. A process of projecting information from the images to the BIM recreates the shapes of the pathology on the objects of the model, which becomes a decision support system for the built environment. A case study of a concrete beam bridge in northern Italy demonstrates the validity of the process. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
