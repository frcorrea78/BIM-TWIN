The course, 'A creative introduction to mechanical engineering', was developed and is taught in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion. In this course, teams of students carry out mini-projects that require the design and construction of devices that perform pre-defined tasks. The qualitative paradigm was found to be suitable for studying the process undergone by the students, mainly because the study focused on the human aspect - the students' emotions, thoughts, behavior, and difficulties. Data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews with the students, the teacher, and the teaching-assistant, by observations in the classroom, and by analyzing students' reports. The paper presents the students' perceptions of: the aim of the course; the instructor's role in a PBL environment; characteristics of PBL course; advantages of the PBL from the students' point of view; PBL as a learning environment for future engineers, and implications of learning in teams.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242573710

This paper introduces an alternative approach to this education based on the concepts of project-based learning. Through the introduction of courses developed by the writers, the paper provides a foundation for changing current education approaches from a lecture-based format to a project-based format. In this format, students are challenged with open-ended problems requiring greater application of multiple engineering concepts as well as requiring interaction with outside experts from within the construction industry and related professions. An outline for a project-based learning course is presented with experiences and lessons learned from four implementations of the course. Student responses are presented to indicate the potential benefits of such an approach. This finding is further supported by the introduction of the Knowledge Landscape concept for construction education that emphasizes greater use of context, scope, and multiple intelligences in construction engineering education. © ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645137210

Educational institutions that are responsible for developing undergraduate students require a strategic plan to adequately prepare future construction managers to be able to better manage the ever-increasing complexity of the construction industry. This paper investigates the most important skills that today’s construction industry requires from graduating construction management students. This research examines a skill set determined by an initial preliminary survey. This skill set was then addressed through structured surveys sent to various industry stakeholders in order to identify the key skills desired by the industry from today’s graduating construction management students. The significance of the study is it identifies the key knowledge areas; personal and professional attributes; skills; and expertise that academic curriculums in construction management programs need to focus on in order to adequately prepare graduating students entering today’s modern and complex construction industry. The study concludes that knowledge of health and safety regulations, interpreting contract documents, listening ability/ giving attention to details, knowledge of building codes and regulations, and time management are the five most important skills desirable in a new hire in construction management. © Associated Schools of Construction.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907591619

This paper presents a proposal for a project management course in the context of a computer science degree. Our proposal combines three well-known methods: project-based learning, spiral learning and peer assessment. Namely, the course is articulated during a semester through the structured (progressive and incremental) development of a sequence of four projects, whose duration, scope and difficulty of management increase as the student gains theoretical and instrumental knowledge related to planning, monitoring and controlling projects. Moreover, the proposal is complemented using peer assessment. The proposal has already been implemented and validated for the last 3 years in two different universities. In the first year, project-based learning and spiral learning methods were combined. Such a combination was also employed in the other 2 years; but additionally, students had the opportunity to assess projects developed by university partners and by students of the other university. A total of 154 students have participated in the study. We obtain a gain in the quality of the subsequently projects derived from the spiral project-based learning. Moreover, this gain is significantly bigger when peer assessment is introduced. In addition, high-performance students take advantage of peer assessment from the first moment, whereas the improvement in poor-performance students is delayed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973864030

The literature clearly states that group learning is superior to individual learning. In the construction industry working in groups to complete projects is the norm. There are three primary methods that an instructor can utilize to accomplish group selection: self-selection, random assignment, and criterion-based selection. This two-phase research project was designed to first compare self-selection and random assignment, and then compare purposefulselection and self-selection. The results, although very valuable, did not find any differentiation between the group selection methods. It was discovered that the groups formed by each of the group selection methods have the potential to excel either beyond expectation or to perform at a level far below average. It was discovered that, in general, the students enjoyed the project, learned a lot about value analysis (a.k.a. value engineering), and almost always had one or more group members who did not participate at expected levels. This paper discusses the mixed methods research results and makes recommendations for group learning pedagogy.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649120830

The new advanced modulation format known as modified Manchester derived from the combination of Manchester and vestigial sideband (VSB) techniques. Its performance assessed and compared in terms of spectral efficiency, chromatic dispersion tolerance and receiver sensitivity against conventional Manchester, return-to-zero (RZ) and non-RZ (NRZ) (with the same spectral width). The optimisation of the optical filter that performed the VSB filtering on the Manchester signal and its detuning frequency results in the compression of the spectral width of the Manchester signal and thereby enhanced the spectral efficiency of the modified Manchester to about 31.3%. This results in the improvement of dispersion tolerance to ~140 ps/nm. In comparison with conventional modulation formats, the proposed system can improve the dispersion tolerance by three times more than conventional Manchester, which is 44 ps/nm, and twice more than NRZ, which is 51.8 ps/nm and has a better dispersion tolerance of 31 ps/nm than RZ with dispersion tolerance of 109 ps/nm at a bit-error-rate of 10-9.

Consider the famous quote by Confucius: ""I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."" This paper discusses a hands-on experiential learning laboratory, which complements the lecture in a Construction Management (CM) materials and methods course. Many CM programs avoid hands-on experiences due to the vocational/technical stigma. However, experiential learning transforms construction concepts that are often abstract and out of context for many students in an exclusively lecture course into tangible objects and processes. The hands-on laboratory reinforces and supplements material covered in lecture and improves course comprehension by allowing students to learn through discovery. The laboratory aspect of the course also improves leadership, promotes teamwork, and increases student confidence. This paper discusses specific laboratory experiences used and their educational value, student feedback regarding the experiential labs, and lessons learned for CM programs interested in adding or expanding their hands-on learning experiences for students. ©; ASCE 2009.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949098624

This information is crucial to teaching and to the development of more effective courses. Yet, very often, instructors in higher education focus on content learning exclusively. While summative assessment of learning in these courses is important, content learning is not the only measure of educational outcomes. This study used an instrument-surveying tool in which the Course Valuing Inventory (CVI) was adapted for Construction Management (CM) courses to evaluate cognitive-content, affective-personal and behavioral learning in students taking these courses. The study also examined the relationship between course valuing scores, Approaches to Study Inventory (ASI), and course performance. Results indicated that the CVI can be adapted for use in CM courses. Multiple regressions run in this exploratory study predicting final course grade from seven predictor variables (student class standing, student self-reported GPA, whether the course was required for the student’s major, likelihood of student continuing with their current major, grade that student anticipated receiving in the course, ASI score, and CVI score), revealed that six of the variables were significant predictors of final course grades. © 2015, Routledge.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945475185

Universities have recognized that the typical Net Generation student is different than predecessors. Technology, elementary and high school instruction, and parental expectations and involvement are vastly different than previous generations. As construction management programs consider how best to educate the next generation of constructors, this research sought to determine how the Net Generation would prefer college construction classes to be delivered and assessed. Traditional construction management classes have been delivered by the ""wise"" professor at center stage. Knowledge has been delivered using lectures and=or Powerpoint1 slides. Research shows that such lectured based models may not be the best educational delivery method to reach the Net Generation. Some of these researchers are even predicting a shift in the teaching paradigm across all of higher education. This project sought to compare the established research on the Net Generation in aggregate with students in the McWhorter School of Building Science at Auburn University. Four focus groups of undergraduate students were used to establish results. Results indicate that construction management students generally agree with the established research on curriculum delivery and assessment for the Net Generation. © Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958112527
