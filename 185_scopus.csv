DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors.

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems.

However, CPSs are still in their conceptualization phase. To this end, much literature effort has been put on their technological characterization, while there is a lack of knowledge on the operations management characterization to manage such new systems. To contribute in this latter direction, this paper reviews literature in order to distinguish between technological characteristics of CPSs and operations management characteristics to build future CPS-based smart factories.

However, the monolithic whole-building models suffer from a limited transfer of models and their data to other contexts. This imposes a vital limitation on the application of machine learning in building design. In this paper, we present a component-based approach that develops machine learning models not only for a parameterized whole building design, but for parameterized components of the design as well. Two decomposition levels, namely construction level components (wall, windows, floors, roof, etc.), and zone-level components, are examined.

The system functions include: (1) dynamic prognosis - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based prognosis is implemented to detect potential faults from customized machining processes. Pre-processing mechanisms of the CNN are designed for partitioning and de-noising monitored signals to strengthen the performance of the system in practical manufacturing situations; (2) an innovative fog enabled prognosis architecture for machining process optimization – it consists of a terminal layer, a fog layer and a cloud layer to minimize data traffic and improve system efficiency. Under the architecture, monitored signals during machining collected on the terminal layer are processed using the trained CNN deployed on the fog layer to efficiently detect abnormal situations. Intensive computing activities like training of the CNN and system re-optimization responding to detected faults are carried out dynamically on the cloud layer to leverage its computation powers.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors. © 2019 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066035816

However, the lack of real-time data available and responsive planning systems make this adaptation difficult. The current situation of the technology of digital twins is to migrate to the digital. More and more companies will develop and introduce their own digital twins in their business processes. This manuscript presents a literature review of the current context of digital twins. A total of 4884 searches combining keywords with respect to digital twins were analyzed.

However, the production companies' internal structures and processes must also meet these flexibility requirements in order for system adjustments to be efficiently carried out. Due to the direct influence on availability, performance and quality losses, maintenance is particularly relevant. Therefore, this paper considers the effects of flexibility on the promising strategy of predictive maintenance. With the digital twin, its update service and a labelling interface, the essential components of a predictive maintenance system for flexible production systems are introduced in detail. This application is based on a reference plant in the form of a flexible hybrid assembly system. The outlook discusses the transferability to other industrial use cases. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084059241

These systems imply the tight integration of physical and software components and are becoming more complex, forming highly inter-connected systems-of-systems. Furthermore, as components and subsystems are becoming more intelligent, there is a need for a paradigm shift towards considering them as ecosystems of collaborative entities with growing levels of autonomy. There is, however, the lack of proper methodologies and support frameworks for the design of such systems. In this context a contribution to an approach for the development of Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems is proposed. It introduces some core definitions, organizational and architectural aspects. The proposed approach is in line with the design science research methodology and is illustrated with some examples. &#x00A9; 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065704509

However, traditional clustering methods do not scale well with the number of data, which limits the ability of handling massive data effectively. We developed an improved kernel clustering algorithm for computing the different clusters of given color images in kernel-induced space for image segmentation. Compared to other popular algorithms, it has the competitive performances both on training time and accuracy.

This is especially challenging for energy ecosystems that are increasingly difficult to control and maintain as the number of participating manufacturers and users grows. Digital Twins help analyze and predict these systems in the form of digital reflections that operate in parallel with the physical system. In this paper, we use Machine Learning to improve the predictive power of Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Energy Systems. Specifically, we use a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model to learn the temporal patterns in the system and predict its responsiveness to specific power setpoint instructions. Real-life data from ten batteries were used to predict the behavior over time. Compared to the baseline model that uses the prior probability of response and the average response rate within the configured time window, the model predicts the batteries' responsiveness more accurately. The more temporal information is used as input for prediction, the better the model performs in both precision and recall. The results show that this compensates for the lack of information when fewer metrics are used. The use of Machine Learning for Digital Twins can help maintain a heterogeneous energy ecosystem, while minimizing the need to acquire or disclose detailed information. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092169596
