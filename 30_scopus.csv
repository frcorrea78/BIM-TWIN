We assume that the number of change-points can increase to infinity with the sample size. Due to a certain random localisation mechanism, WBS works even for very short spacings between the change-points and/or very small jump magnitudes, unlike standard binary segmentation. On the other hand, despite its use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS: one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the 'strengthened Schwarz information criterion'. We provide default recommended values of the parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical performance in comparison with the state of the art. The WBS methodology is implemented in the R package wbs, available on CRAN. In addition, we provide a new proof of consistency of binary segmentation with improved rates of convergence, as well as a corresponding result for WBS. © 2014 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908219936

External and internal climate data recorded over three months were used to build and validate models for predicting dry bulb temperature and relative humidity for different time-scales (30 min to 3 h ahead). In order to compare the accuracy for different step-ahead predictions, different performance measures, such as goodness of fit, mean squared error, mean absolute error and coefficient of determination between predicted model output and real measurements, were calculated. For the NNARX model, the optimal network structure after training, is subsequently determined by pruning the fully connected network using the optimal brain surgeon strategy.

The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption.

However, since indoor environment is dependent on many uncertain criteria, performance of BEMS can be suboptimal at times. Unfortunately, complexity of BEMSs, large amount of data, and interrelations between data can make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. This paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Anomaly Detection and Linguistic Description (Fuzzy-ADLD)-based method for improving the understandability of BEMS behavior for improved state-awareness. The presented method is composed of two main parts: 1) detection of anomalous BEMS behavior; and 2) linguistic representation of BEMS behavior. The first part utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to build a model of normal BEMS behavior. The second part of the presented method computes the most relevant linguistic description of the identified anomalies. The presented Fuzzy-ADLD method was applied to real-world BEMS system and compared against a traditional alarm-based BEMS. Six different scenarios were tested, and the presented Fuzzy-ADLD method identified anomalous behavior either as fast as or faster (an hour or more) than the alarm based BEMS.

In the last 20 years, the empirically derived adaptive model of thermal comfort has emerged as a powerful alternative to fixed set-point driven design. However, current adaptive standards offer a simple linear relationship between the outdoor temperature and the indoor comfort temperature, assumed to sufficiently explain the effect of all other variables, e.g. relative humidity (RH) and air velocity. The lack of a signal for RH is particularly surprising given its well-known impact on comfort. Attempts in the literature to either explain the lack of such a signal or demonstrate its existence, remain scattered, unsubstantiated and localised. In this paper we demonstrate, for the first time, that a humidity signal exists in adaptive thermal comfort using global data to form two separate lines of evidence: a meta-analysis of summary data from 63 field studies and detailed field data from 39 naturally ventilated buildings over 8 climate types. We implicate method selection in previous work as the likely cause of failure to detect this signal, by demonstrating that our chosen method has a 56% lower error rate. We derive a new designer-friendly RH-inclusive adaptive model that significantly extends the range of acceptable indoor conditions for designing low-energy naturally-conditioned buildings all over the world.

Civil infrastructures are being inspected less frequently because of the high cost and long duration of current inspection procedures. Furthermore, conventional inspection procedures often interrupt the routine functioning of the infrastructure, are inspector-dependent and expose the inspectors to complex and unsafe working environments. Visual inspection technologies play a crucial role in the inspection and maintenance of civil infrastructures. Automation-assisted technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles equipped with multiple imaging and sensing systems have been developed to address some of these issues with the conventional visual inspection processes. This paper reviews peer-reviewed research publications investigating automated visual inspection technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, 53 publications satisfying a set of inclusion criteria were reviewed, its results highlighting the application domain, the level of autonomy of the automated systems, the sensor technologies used for the inspection process and navigation, the navigation and control technologies and the algorithms used. The review of the articles revealed that the data collected by automation is used to augment the qualitative assessment. Several types of algorithms such as target detection and image enhancing have been developed to reduce the inspector bias in these automated technologies. Path planning algorithms reduce the workload on the inspector by automating the navigation and control tasks. Remotely operated systems reduce the risk to the inspectors by minimizing their exposure to the inspection environment. However, only a limited number of studies investigated the human factors aspects of the automation-assisted inspection process. It is important to understand the cognitive, physical, and temporal demands these technologies place on inspectors to improve the design of systems assisting in the inspection process. Moreover, factors such as automation bias, trust in the system and communication between the automation and the operator need to be investigated. Furthermore, it is important to incorporate appropriate decision aids that support adequate situation awareness in the interface design.

Typically these systems are used to gather large amounts of data, while the detection of anomalies (such as system failures, intrusion, or unanticipated behavior of the environment) in the data (or other types or processing) is performed in centralized computer systems. In spite of the great interest that it attracts, the systematic porting and analysis of centralized anomaly detection algorithms to a decentralized paradigm (compatible with the aforementioned sensor systems) has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. We approach this task from a new angle, assessing the viability of localized (in-node) anomaly detection based on machine learning. The main challenges we address are: (1) deploying decentralized, automated, online learning, anomaly detection algorithms within the stringent constraints of typical embedded systems; and (2) evaluating the performance of such algorithms and comparing them with that of centralized ones. To this end, we first analyze (and port) single and multi-dimensional input classifiers that are trained incrementally online and whose computational requirements are compatible with the limitations of embedded platforms. Next, we combine multiple classifiers in a single online ensemble. Then, using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different application domains, we extensively evaluate the anomaly detection performance of our algorithms and ensemble, in terms of precision and recall, and compare it to that of well-known offline, centralized machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the ensemble performs better than each individual decentralized classifier and that it can match the performance of the offline alternatives, thus showing that our approach is a viable solution to detect anomalies, even in environments with little a priori knowledge. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960803783

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices.

The paper starts with a thorough review on previous work in which multiple information processing technologies are applied to aid FM. The following section presents the conceivable merits when the novel visualization is formulated to enhance the conventional IM application. It then proposes a novel system framework based on technological feasibility and further describes the development of a system prototype that boosts immersive and interactive experiences to FM toward a multitude of electrical components.

With the successful development of the system, it is able to deal with the management of complex information flows, support the users' navigation in geo-coordinates, and enables a succinct smart IM interface with switchable AV/AR scenes. In view that IM has been proved suitable in supporting real-time communication and information management while AV/AR can be effectively used to improve the way how information is exhibited into real workspaces, the system proves the concept of IM+AV/AR in the context of FM in a refinery.

Residual-based EWMA control chart with designing chart limits is used to detect faults of air handling units. In order to provide a level of robustness with respect to modeling errors, control limits are determined by incorporating uncertainty information into EWMA control chart. Furthermore, the rule-based fault diagnosis method is extended to isolate simultaneous multiple faults of VAV air handling units in the mechanical cooling operation mode. Twenty-six expert rules consisting of system behavior rules and energy related rules are used to diagnose twenty-two faults of air handling units. The fault detection and diagnosis strategy was validated by using the operating data from real VAV air-conditioning systems involving multiple artificial faults. The results of validation show that residual-based EWMA control chart with designing control limits is a robust tool of fault detection for air handling units.

The field is quite mature but still evolving as it adapts to the surge of energy interval data provided by smart meters. For example, many of the simpler physics-based models relying on regression methods are being enhanced by the use of machine learning or data mining techniques coupled with knowledge bases of energy use data from different generic building types and other types of data streams. Although quite sophisticated, the published literature seems lacking in robust and sensitive methods to perform some of the simpler analysis tasks. Two such tasks are related to the automated identification and removal of outlier data points during days when the building is operated abnormally, and to the identification of day types or, more correctly, to the identification of a parsimonious set of building operational and occupancy schedules. This paper proposes a methodology to perform those tasks (which can be automated) using robust techniques borrowed from the data mining literature. These tasks are essential if one wishes to subsequently use the data to operate the buildings more efficiently - for example, to identify baseline models, to perform condition monitoring, or for short-term load prediction for demand response programs.

Despite many potential benefits, the question remains, whether useful and straightforward knowledge are transferred to the occupants about their energy use patterns. In this context, the key is to develop methodologies that can effectively analyze occupants’ energy use behavior and distinguish their energy-inefficient behavior (if any). Previous studies seldom considered the dynamics of occupancy, which may result in misleading information to the occupants and inefficacy in recognizing the actual wasteful behavior. To fill this gap, this study proposes a data mining framework with a combination of change point analysis (CPA), cluster analysis, and association rule mining (ARM) to explore the relationship between occupancy and building energy consumption, aiming at identifying potential energy waste patterns and to provide useful feedback to the occupants. To demonstrate the capability of the developed framework, it was applied to datasets collected from two different apartments located in Lyon, France. Results indicate that different energy waste patterns can be effectively discovered in both apartments through the proposed framework and a substantial amount of energy savings can be achieved by modifying occupants’ energy use behavior. The proposed framework is flexible and can be adaptive to households with different occupancy patterns and habitual energy-use behavior. Nevertheless, the discovered energy saving potentials and benchmark values are limited to the apartments considered in this study and similar analysis based on the proposed framework are needed in wider building stocks to explore its generalizability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069629635

Less attention has been focussed on automation of visual information, such as images, when improving timely maintenance decisions. This study aims to develop image classification algorithms to improve information flow in the inspection-repair process through building information modelling (BIM). Design/methodology/approach: To improve and automate the inspection-repair process, image classification algorithms were used to connect images with a corresponding image database in a BIM knowledge repository. Quick response (QR) code decoding and Bag of Words were chosen to classify images in the system. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to facilitate activity collaboration and communication. A pilot case study in an inspection-repair process was applied to demonstrate the applications of this system. Findings: The system developed in this study associates the inspection-repair process with a digital three-dimensional (3D) model, GUIs, a BIM knowledge repository and image classification algorithms. By implementing the proposed application in a case study, the authors found that improvement of the inspection-repair process and automated image classification with a BIM knowledge repository (such as the one developed in this study) can enhance FM practices by increasing productivity and reducing time and costs associated with ecision-making.

The optimization aims at minimizing the total cost while tuning some parameters, such as the number, time, and quality of inspections. Due to the unavoidable uncertainties, the expected cost of maintenance and failure can only be estimated by assessing the reliability of the system. The problem is, therefore, formulated as a time-variant reliability-based optimization, where both objective and constraint functions require the assessment of reliability with time. This paper proposes an efficient general numerical technique to solve this problem by means of just one single reliability analysis, while explicitly taking the diverse forms of uncertainty into account. The technique is generally applicable to any problem where the ageing or damage propagation process is known by means of input-output relationships, which apply to a great number of the cases. This technique exploits a Monte Carlo strategy derived from the concept of forced simulation, which significantly increases the efficiency of computing the optimal solution. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach is shown by means of an example involving a fatigue-prone weld in a bridge girder. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045318116

As such, the productivity of scaffolding operations in turnaround maintenance (TAM) has attracted much attention in recent years. In addition, health and safety issues have been recognised as a key contributor along with productivity improvement in the LNG industry. This study aims to integrate work posture analysis into value stream mapping to achieve an optimised and balanced improvement in both productivity and health and safety. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach is adopted to integrate lean and work posture analysis in a TAM site. The lean improvement is conducted through value stream mapping, and the work posture analysis is conducted through the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System method. A three-step optimisation strategy is then developed for achieving optimised performance in waste reduction and work posture improvement. Findings: It is found that the implementation of value stream mapping can help eliminate waste in the installation process, therefore eliminating potential health and safety risks. However, health and safety of onsite workers does not always improve as lean implementation intensifies. There is an optimised erection schedule that has the lowest health and safety risk within a waste reduction target. Originality/value: In contradiction to previous studies, which rely on qualitative assessment to identify the a positive correlation between lean and health and safety, this study reveals the distinct difference between lean attributes and health and safety attributes through a quantitative assessment and is more readily to be implemented at the site level for simultaneous improvement in lean and health and safety. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084443255

Subsequently, the consequences of failure fall on the aspects of output, safety and healthy, environmental integrity, system quality, and customer satisfaction. Condition-based maintenance is seen as a potential strategy to improve performance. Whereby, the key success factor of this maintenance strategy is identified as the system inspection. This study aims to investigate the association between system breakdown rate and frequency of inspection. A mixed method approach is implemented by distributing questionnaire and interviewing for data collection. Subsequently, descriptive analysis, correlation analysis and regression are adopted to analyse the collected data from 100 respondents and the results are validated with interview data of 10 interviewees. The research result establishes significant relationship between the system breakdown rate and the frequency of inspection. Additionally, the result of regression analysis confirms that the frequency of inspection is the significant predictor of system breakdown rate. Planning of accurate inspection frequency is crucial to secure the system performance. Hence, the research signifies the importance to carry out regular inspection towards the building systems and components. As a recommendation, the maintenance personnel should assess the risk criticality of the building systems. Then, continuously monitor the condition of critical building systems; regularly inspect the condition of non-critical building systems and randomly inspect all of them.

We present an approach, which is based on recent developments in the field of risk-based operation and maintenance planning at the structural system level. The approach utilizes heuristics to define inspection and repair strategies at the system level and to reduce the search space of possible strategies. For each defined strategy, the expected service life cost of inspection, repair and failure is evaluated based on simulated inspection and repair histories. Subset simulation is applied to compute the conditional repair and failure probabilities required for this analysis. It also forms the basis for simulating inspection and repair histories. The strategy that minimizes the expected service life cost is the optimal one in the set of pre-selected strategies. The underlying condition and performance model accounts for the stochastic dependence among the deterioration states of the different structural elements and the structural redundancy. The approach is demonstrated in a case study considering a jacket-type frame. In this study, we essentially vary the inspection interval, the minimum number of inspected components and the target reliability, and identify the combination that minimizes the expected total service life cost. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063971380
