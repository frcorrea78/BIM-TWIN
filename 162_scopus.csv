The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style ""push-relabel"" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style ""augmenting paths."" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible.

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for ""border matting"" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels.

Such information directly supports control decision-making and if automated, can significantly impact management of a project. This paper presents a new automated approach for recognition of physical progress based on two emerging sources of information: (1) unordered daily construction photo collections, which are currently collected at almost no cost on all construction sites; and (2) building information models (BIMs), which are increasingly turning into binding components of architecture/engineering/construction contracts. First, given a set of unordered and uncalibrated site photographs, an approach based on structure-from-motion, multiview stereo, and voxel coloring and labeling algorithms is presented that calibrates cameras, photorealistically reconstructs a dense as-built point cloud model in four dimensions (three dimensions + time), and traverses and labels the scene for occupancy. This strategy explicitly accounts for occlusions and allows input images to be taken far apart and widely distributed around the environment. An Industry Foundation Class-based (IFC-based) BIM is subsequently fused into the as-built scene by a robust registration step and is traversed and labeled for expected progress visibility. Next, a machine-learning scheme built upon a Bayesian probabilistic model is proposed that automatically detects physical progress in the presence of occlusions and demonstrates that physical progress monitoring at schedule activity level could be fully automated. Finally, the system enables the expected and reconstructed elements to be explored with an interactive, image-based, three-dimensional (3D) viewer where deviations are automatically color-coded over the IFC-based BIM. To that extent, the underlying hypotheses and algorithms for generating integrated four-dimensional (4D) as-built and as-planned models plus automated progress monitoring are presented. Experimental results are reported for challenging image data sets collected under different lighting conditions and severe occlusions from two ongoing building construction projects. This marks the presented model as being the first probabilistic model for automated progress tracking and visualization of deviations that incorporates both as-planned models and unordered daily photographs in a principled way. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920815816

Current protocols require lengthy inspections and expensive equipment to examine large infrastructure systems. Furthermore, changes in inspection protocols over time can create discontinuities in recording and understanding the time history of a structure. To address these challenges, a systematic and adaptive technique for converting two-dimensional (2D) digital images into three-dimensional (3D) models has been developed, with the goal of creating high-resolution and scale-accurate inspection records. The developed reconstruction technique utilizes multiscale imaging to reconstruct a structure with varying levels of details and geometric complexity. The captured images are then converted into photorealistic, accurate, and dense 3D scene reconstructions by utilizing a hierarchical adaptation of a dense structure-from-motion (DSfM) algorithm. The result of this approach is a virtual 3D model of the structure with accurate geometry and high-fidelity representation of fine details. The accuracy, completeness, adaptability, and feasibility of the developed method were compared to both terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and conventional DSfM methods. Experimental findings and direct comparison between generated point clouds indicate that the developed hierarchical technique consistently produces dense point clouds capable of resolving 0.1-mm details, an order of magnitude improvement over existing methods. The developed technique also allows for user-controlled point cloud density, a significant benefit over current reconstruction methods. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009284510

Manual analysis of these point clouds is often time consuming and labor intensive and does not provide explicit information on structural performance and health conditions, highlighting the need for new techniques to efficiently analyze these models. This paper presents a new 3D point cloud change analysis approach for tracking small movements over time through localized spatial analytics.

Research has focused on automating parts of the inspection process using unmanned aerial vehicles for image acquisition, followed by deep learning techniques for damage identification. Existing deep learning methods and datasets for inspections have typically been developed for a single damage type. However, most guidelines for inspections require the identification of multiple damage types and describe evaluating the significance of the damage based on the associated material type. Thus, the identification of material type is important in understanding the meaning of the identified damage. Training separate networks for the tasks of material and damage identification fails to incorporate this intrinsic interdependence between them. We hypothesize that a network that incorporates such interdependence directly will have a better accuracy in material and damage identification. To this end, a deep neural network, termed the material-and-damage-network (MaDnet), is proposed to simultaneously identify material type (concrete, steel, asphalt), as well as fine (cracks, exposed rebar) and coarse (spalling, corrosion) structural damage. In this approach, semantic segmentation (i.e., assignment of each pixel in the image with a material and damage label) is employed, where the interdependence between material and damage is incorporated through shared filters learned through multi-objective optimization. A new dataset with pixel-level labels identifying the material and damage type is developed and made available to the research community. Finally, the dataset is used to evaluate MaDnet and demonstrate the improvement in pixel accuracy over employing independent networks. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086161453

Following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes it was observed that URM cavity-walls generally suffered irreparable damage due to a lack of effective wall restraint and deficient cavity-tie connections, combined with weak mortar strength. It was found that the original cavity-ties were typically corroded due to moisture ingress, resulting in decreased lateral loadbearing capacity of the cavity-walls.

Three types of out-of-plane wall failure were recognised: (1) overturning response, (2) one-way bending, and (3) two-way bending. In-plane damage was less widely observed (28%) and commonly included diagonal shear cracking through mortar bed joints or bricks.

In the United States, federal and state agencies responsible for managing such infrastructure assets are investigating the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to allow for remote data acquisition. Processing the large amounts of data acquired by the UAV remains a challenging task. Over the past four years, researchers have been investigating deep learning methods for automated damage detection through image classification and more recently, the use of semantic segmentation where each pixel in the image is given a certain label. For such algorithms to work effectively, deep neural networks need to be trained on large datasets of labelled images. The generation of these labels for semantic segmentation is a very tedious process as it requires each pixel in the image to be labelled. This paper investigates the use of computer graphics to automatically generate synthetic imagery for the purposes of training deep learning algorithms for vision-based damage detection using semantic segmentation. The significant advantage of this is the automatic generation of precise semantic labels due to the implicit information in the developed graphics models. Parametric noise-based graphics texture models are created for defects such as cracks and corrosion and for other features such as vegetation growth, and dirt. The parameterization of the texture models allows for generation of a range of different surface conditions, thereby providing increased flexibility over data generation. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methodology for synthetic data generation a virtual environment of inland navigation infrastructure including miter gates and tainter gate dams is created. The developed texture models are applied to the virtual environment to produce a photo-realistic model. Synthetic image data is then rendered from the developed model and used to demonstrate the efficacy for training deep learning-based semantic segmentation algorithms for damage detection. © 2019 by DEStech Publications, Inc.

Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is an established methodology that allows engineers to make risk-informed decisions regarding the design and operation of safety-critical and high-value assets in industries such as nuclear and aerospace. The current paper aims to formulate a risk-based decision framework for structural health monitoring that combines elements of PRA with the existing SHM paradigm. As an apt tool for reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty, probabilistic graphical models serve as the foundation of the framework. The framework involves modelling failure modes of structures as Bayesian network representations of fault trees and then assigning costs or utilities to the failure events. The fault trees allow for information to pass from probabilistic classifiers to influence diagram representations of decision processes whilst also providing nodes within the graphical model that may be queried to obtain marginal probability distributions over local damage states within a structure. Optimal courses of action for structures are selected by determining the strategies that maximise expected utility. The risk-based framework is demonstrated on a realistic truss-like structure and supported by experimental data. Finally, a discussion of the risk-based approach is made and further challenges pertaining to decision-making processes in the context of SHM are identified. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092694355

The proposed framework integrates component-level damage simulation, virtual inspection, and structural collapse performance assessment. Engineering demand parameters from nonlinear response history analyses are used in conjunction with component-level damage simulation to generate multiple realizations of damage to key structural elements. Triggering damage state ratios, which describe the fraction of components within a damage state that results in an unsafe placard assignment, are explicitly linked to the increased collapse vulnerability of the damaged building. A case study is presented in which the framework is applied to a 4-story reinforced concrete frame building with masonry infills. The results show that when subjected to maximum considered earthquake level ground motions, the probability of experiencing enough structural damage to trigger an unsafe placard, leading to building closure, is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the risk of collapse.

The application of those methods typically requires large amounts of training data that consists of images and corresponding ground truth annotations. However, obtaining such datasets is challenging, because the images are annotated manually in most existing approaches. With the limited availability of datasets, development of effective visual recognition systems that can extract all required information is not straightforward. This research leverages synthetic environments to develop a unified system for automated vision-based structural condition assessment that can identify and localize critical structural components, and then detect and quantify damage of those components. The synthetic environments can produce images and associated ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation of structural components and damage, as well as monocular depth estimation for structural component localization. To illustrate the approach, automated vision-based structural condition assessment of reinforced concrete railway viaducts for a Japanese high-speed railway line (the Tokaido Shinkansen) is explored. The effectiveness of the synthetic environments and the generated dataset (the Tokaido dataset) is demonstrated by training fully convolutional network-based semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation algorithms, and then testing the networks using both synthetic and real-world images. Finally, all trained algorithms are combined to realize an automated system for structural condition assessment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104354450

This technology could therefore provide improved and robust decision making for asset management. Although the applications of digital twins vary, this paper focuses on digital twins for structural dynamic systems. A key consideration in developing a digital twin is in the construction of a workflow that defines decisions and interactions within the modelling framework. This process will generally be bespoke to specific applications, however key principles will apply. Furthermore, a workflow will provide a methodology for identifying poor predictive performance and systematically improving predictions via optimal decision making. In this paper a three storey building structure is introduced as a case study in order to motivate the challenges and technologies required of a digital twin. The context of this case study is to develop a digital twin of the building structure that consistently predicts the acceleration response of the three floors given an unknown structural state, caused by a contact nonlinearity between two floors. This reflects realistic challenges for a digital twin in that the physical twin will degrade with age, and its response may change under various loading scenarios, unforeseen in the initial model development phase. Key elements within a potential workflow for this application are discussed. These include indicating when model updating schemes become problematic and how augmenting physics-based models with a data-based component can provide information about poor predictive performance. These techniques are linked to hybrid testing, as a potential method for improving model development based on the physical structure in a controlled offline manner. Finally, the impact of these procedures are discussed for model based control methods in terms of vibration attenuation performance, but also robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances. The workflow and key technologies investigated in this specific case study are expected to outline the general processes that apply to digital twins more broadly, and provide a clearer understanding of how a digital twin should be implemented. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105781832

The success of deep learning and the proliferation of low-cost consumer robots has spurred rapid growth in research and application of autonomous inspections. The major components of autonomous inspection include data acquisition, data processing, and decision making, which are usually studied independently. However, for robust real-world applicability, these three aspects of the overall process need to be addressed concurrently with end-to-end testing, incorporating scenarios such as varia-tions in structure type, color, damage level, camera distance, view angle, lighting, etc. Developing real-world datasets that span all these scenarios is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework to create a virtual visual inspection testbed using 3D synthetic environments that can enable end-to-end testing of autonomous inspection strategies. To populate the 3D synthetic environment with virtual damaged buildings, we propose the use of a non-linear finite element model to inform the realistic and automated visual rendering of different damage types, the damage state, and the material textures of what are termed herein physics-based graphics models (PBGMs). To demonstrate the benefits of the autonomous inspection testbed, three experiments are conducted with models of earthquake damaged reinforced concrete buildings. First, we implement the proposed framework to generate a new large-scale annotated benchmark dataset for post-earthquake inspections of buildings termed QuakeCity. Second, we demonstrate the improved performance of deep learning models trained using the QuakeCity dataset for inference on real data. Finally, a comparison of deep learning-based damage state estimation for different data acquisition strategies is carried out. The results demonstrate the use of PBGMs as an effective testbed for the development and validation of strategies for autonomous vision-based inspections of civil infrastructure. © 2022 by the authors.

Using 4D building information model (BIM) or 3D reality model as a priori, these metrics provide feedback on the quality of a plan (within a few minutes), accounting for resolution, visibility, accuracy, completeness of the capture, and satisfying battery capacity and line-of-sight requirements. A cloud-based system is introduced to create and optimize UAV/rover missions in the context of prior model. Results from real-world construction data sets demonstrate that the proposed metrics offer actionable insights into the accuracy and completeness of reality capture plans. Additionally, a capture plan—with a combination of canonical and noncanonical camera views—that satisfies the introduced metrics is statistically correlated with the quality of reconstructed reality. These metrics can improve computer-vision progress monitoring and inspection methods that rely on the construction site's appearance and geometry. © 2021 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105119107

With the increasing number of SHM systems deployed on modern structures in recent years, real-time model updating has become possible. This allows a digital twin of the monitored structure to be built, such that the structural behaviour can be monitored and predicted simultaneously throughout its life-cycle. In real applications, the structural response data are normally measured under operational conditions where the environment and loading condition cannot be directly controlled, which leads to significant identification uncertainty. The system model can also be complex, meaning that identifying system parameters directly from measured response data is challenging and time consuming. Focusing on the above concern, a real-time updating strategy for a SHM digital twin is proposed in this work. An intermediate model is used for environmental condition estimation and divergence analysis in order to increase the updating efficiency. A Bayesian system identification approach is adopted so that the identification uncertainty can be fully accounted for. Synthetic and laboratory examples are presented to illustrate the proposed updating strategy. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120419411
