The paper measures BIM use throughout the project lifecycle, confirming BIM is most often used in the early stages with progressively less use in the latter stages. This research demonstrates via 92 responses from a sample of BIM users that collaboration aspects produce the highest positive impact. The process aspects are more important than the software technology. BIM necessitates investment in software and training however, smaller practices can afford it. Stakeholder financial benefits are ranked concluding that clients benefit most financially from BIM followed by Facilities Managers. Despite this, over 70% do not provide a 3D model and Cobie dataset at the conclusion of a project. Identification of Key Performance Indicators currently being used for BIM is provided and findings indicate a lack of industry expertise and training providing an opportunity for education providers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Failure to adequately manage risks may not only lead to difficulties in meeting project objectives but also influence land-use planning and urban spatial design in the future growth of cities. Due to the rapid development and adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and BIM-related digital technologies, the use of these technologies for risk management has become a growing research trend leading to a demand for a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of these developments. This paper presents a summary of traditional risk management, and a comprehensive and extensive review of published literature concerning the latest efforts of managing risk using technologies, such as BIM, automatic rule checking, knowledge based systems, reactive and proactive IT (information technology)-based safety systems. The findings show that BIM could not only be utilised to support the project development process as a systematic risk management tool, but it could also serve as a core data generator and platform to allow other BIM-based tools to perform further risk analysis. Most of the current efforts have concentrated on investigating technical developments, and the management of construction personnel safety has been the main interest so far. Because of existing technical limitations and the lack of “human factor” testing, BIM-based risk management has not been commonly used in real environments. In order to overcome this gap, future research is proposed that should: (1) have a multi-disciplinary system-thinking, (2) investigate implementation methods and processes, (3) integrate traditional risk management with new technologies, and (4) support the development process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955321043

Construction Safety requires care and planning throughout the project life-cycle, from the design phase to maintenance. Initial attempts to improve OHS consider the safety aspects in the design phase and the development of manual safety processes in the execution phase. The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently experiencing rapid growth in construction operations, planning and management, as well as in Safety Management. Thanks to the use of this new tool, we can expect to see a change in the way that safety is addressed, as seen in the literature review, based on the large number of contributions in recent years. This study reviews the existing literature surrounding BIM and Construction Safety in order to explore both useful findings and the gaps in knowledge for future research. The main result shows that the growing implementation of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is changing the way safety can be approached. Potential safety hazards can be automatically identified and corresponding prevention methods can be applied using an automated approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027857136

The paper presents a governance approach for managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data, informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the identified adoption blockers underpinned by a ""mixed approach"", that factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is discussed in the context of the recent UK government BIM industry consultation document supported by a research and development (R&D) roadmap taking into account current industry structure and its various levels of stakeholders maturity, capability and readiness.

Document management collaboration systems (e.g. Extranets) have significantly improved the document collaboration in recent years; however their capabilities for model collaboration are limited and do not support the complex requirements of BIM collaboration. The construction industry is responding to this situation by adopting emerging model collaboration systems (MCS), such as model servers, with the ability to exploit and reuse information directly from the models to extend the current intra-disciplinary collaboration towards integrated multi-disciplinary collaboration on models. The functions of existing MCSs have evolved from the manufacturing industry and there is no concrete study on how these functions correspond to the requirements of the construction industry, especially with BIM requirements. This research has conducted focus group sessions with major industry disciplines to explore the user requirements for BIM collaboration. The research results have been used to categorise and express the features of existing MCS which are then analysed in selected MCS from a user's perspective. The potential of MCS and the match or gap in user requirements and available model collaboration features is discussed. This study concludes that model collaborative solutions for construction industry users are available in different capacities; however a comprehensive custom built solution is yet to be realized. The research results are useful for construction industry professionals, software developers and researchers involved in exploring collaborative solutions for the construction industry. © 2013 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876918346

The UK government has acknowledged this trend and is joining the radical movement of adopting BIM by also making it a prerequisite for all those involved in public sector projects to have BIM ready by 2016. For Quantity Surveying (QS) profession, BIM presents huge challenges and opportunities, particularly in the area of cost estimating and quantity take-off. BIM offers the capability to automatically generate quantity take-offs and measurement directly from a digital model of a building, a process that traditionally is very time consuming for quantity surveyors. However, there is little evidence that BIM is systematically introduced in quantity surveying profession in UK largely due to majority of the BIM based cost estimating or take-off tools developed outside UK and adopted the different practice and rules in quantification. In this paper, we examine the cost estimating practice and procedure in UK and the impact of the use of BIM. A number of key challenges have been identified in term of information exchange, model quality and UK standards. It also reviews the existing BIM based cost estimating tools in the context of UK quantity surveying practice. A review methodology is developed to evaluate the ability of the existing BIM technology to support the UK QS practices. The methodology is applied to a number of leading BIM based estimating tools. The review assesses the technical and process approach of each tool and their ability of adapting to UK quantity surveying practice, particularly with the New Rules of Measurement (NRM), which is aimed to provide a holistic view of the technologies for the Quantity Surveying professions to make informed decisions. © 2014 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937220254

Facility managers are responsible to fulfil this need during the whole life cycle of the construction works in a manner that maximises the economical profit, minimises the environmental impact and keeps the risk of failure at a low level. A prerequisite for efficient facility management (FM) is long-term planning of MR&R actions. This requires management of a large amount of information, a process that includes gathering, storing, processing and presentation of data. With the development of open Building Information Models (open BIM) and standardisation of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) new possibilities of efficient management of FM information have emerged. Due to its parametric and object-oriented approach, the open BIM-concept rationalises the information management and makes it more cost effective. This paper discusses how open BIM, with the aid of IFC, and Product Life Cycle Support (PLCS) may facilitate the implementation of a predictive Life cycle Management System (LMS) and by that improve the feasibility for adopting long-term and dynamic maintenance strategy in the FM process. A case study on the use of a commercial BIM-based design tool as information repository and media to present life cycle information within the context of the LMS concept on a hospital building is also presented. The case study shows that the build-up of the information becomes simpler, more clear and efficient compared to a traditional database solution, as it is done with parametric objects. However, the basic BIM can not serve for all LMS functions. There is still need for development of a BIM integrated LMS solution that may support prediction of life cycle performance and maintenance needs. Such a solution needs to be communicative to any open BIM software and thus has to be built upon open standards for exchange of building information, e.g. the IFC standard, and life cycle oriented standards like PLCS. Additional focus is put on 4D simulation and visualisation. Simulation and visualisation of long-term performance of buildings is of crucial importance when improving the feasibility for adopting a long-term and dynamic maintenance strategy in the FM process. © 2011 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954561118

BIM affects various actors of the built environment, e.g. government structures, enterprises, and industry groups. Notably, BIM is not newly-found, yet it radically alters the way construction firms operate. BIM evolved from an industrysponsored effort to share consistent information among low tiers of the supply chain, towards collaboration across all tiers. As public bodies start to mandate BIM, firms have to radically -or brutally -innovate their businesses. This paper explores BIM innovation via the lens of institutional logics in contexts with low and high BIM diffusion. It compares the United Kingdom -where BIM was mandated in 2016 -and some Nordic countries and the Netherlands -where it is not yet mandated. The study draws upon grey and scientific literature to explain how innovation unfolds macroscopically and concludes that contextual sensitivities are lacking in BIM debate.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035330771

Next, we review the software implementations of PM tools for BIM, to estimate the actual output of BIM for PM. We show that the utilisation of BIM for PM is high in areas such as information management and performance management.
