IoT applications are nearly limitless while enabling seamless integration of the cyber-world with the physical world. However, despite the enormous efforts of standardization bodies, alliances, industries, researchers and others, there are still numerous problems to deal with in order to reach the full potential of IoT. These issues should be considered from various aspects such as enabling technologies, applications, business models, social and environmental impacts. In focus of this paper are open issues and challenges considered from the technological perspective. Just for clarification, we put in light different visions that stand behind this paradigm in order to facilitate a better understanding of the IoT's features. Furthermore, this exhaustive survey provides insights into the state-of-the-art of IoT enabling and emerging technologies. The most relevant among them are addressed with some details. The main scope is to deliver a comprehensive overview of open issues and challenges to be tackled by future research. We provide some insights into specific emerging ideas in order to facilitate future research. Also, this paper brings order in the existing literature by classifying contributions according to different research topics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050727862

While the IoT deployment in the built environment is growing exponentially, there exists a gap in integrating these two in a systematic way through open standards and systems. From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models. The paper describes the design criteria, the system architecture, the workflow and a proof of concept with potential use cases that integrate IoT with the built environment. Initial results show that both the end users and other research groups can benefit from such platforms by either consuming the data in their daily life or using the data for more advance research. © 2018 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051379498

Building information modeling (BIM) has been developed as a potential technology for FMM in buildings. This study proposes an FMM framework based on BIM and facility management systems (FMSs), which can provide automatic scheduling of maintenance work orders (MWOs) to enhance good decision making in FMM. In this framework, data are mapped between BIM and FMSs according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) extension of maintenance tasks and MWO information in order to achieve data integration. After bi-directional data transmission between the BIM models and FMSs, work order information is visualized in BIM via API to identify components that have failed. Second, geometric and semantic information of the failure components is extracted from the BIM models to calculate the sub-optimal maintenance path in the BIM environment. Third, the MWO schedule is automatically generated using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers four factors, namely, problem type, emergency level, distance among components, and location. Illustrative examples are given in the paper to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in indoor and outdoor 3D environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042846827

While BIM adoption is growing, it can be witnessed that adoption is relatively weak within operational and maintenance (O&M) organisations such as Estate and Infrastructure Management, who would ultimately gain the highest value from utilising BIM. While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems. There is a clear gap of knowledge on how to structure a BIM model that allows its efficient use in the O&M phase. Furthermore, there is a lack of claritiy on how to exchange information from a BIM model into an Asset Information Model (AIM). This paper outlines a methodology that enables extraction of BIM-related data directly from a model into a relational database for integration with existing asset management systems. The paper describes the BIM model requirements, development of the extraction platform, database architecture and framework. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. The case study demonstrates that if the BIM model is designed from the start with consideration for the O&M requirements, it can be exploited for development into an AIM. It also shows that a structured approach to object classification within a BIM model supports the efficient exchange of data directly from the BIM model. © 2019 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070275875

Smart sensors obtain feedback, especially occupants' information, from mobile phones and wearable devices placed on human body. The information can be used to adjust air conditioners in advance according to humans' intentions, in so-called intention causing control. Experimental results show that the indoor temperature can be controlled accurately with errors of less than ±0.1 °C. Rapid cool down can be achieved within 2 min to the optimized indoor capacity after occupants enter a room. It's also noted that within two-hour operation the total compressor output of the smart air conditioner is 48.4% less than that of the one using On-Off control. The smart air conditioner with wearable devices could detect the human temperature and activity during sleep to determine the sleeping state and adjusting the sleeping function flexibly. The sleeping function optimized by the smart air conditioner with wearable devices could reduce the energy consumption up to 46.9% and keep the human health. The presented smart air conditioner could provide a comfortable environment and achieve the goals of energy conservation and environmental protection. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903289463

Simulating energy usage data through advanced technologies like Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become possible of late, and data-mining methods that use various data types (e.g., BIM, energy simulation, sensor, and facility management data) will be needed in the future for decision-making support in BIM-based energy management. Proposed herein is a rule-set-based BIM-based data-mining method for data integration and function extension support that considers functional variability and extensibility. Its work effectiveness was verified through the development and creation of a building-energy-management-related scenario and the analysis of the results thereof. Based on the analysis of work effectiveness, we identified that using the proposed method, the effectiveness improved by 14.4 to 20.5 times.

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interview is adopted in this research as the main methodology. In total, 30 FM professionals in the UK were interviewed to explore the past, present and future of FM. The analysis of interview results helps to identify the key areas in which FM has changed, is changing and will change. It also helps to explain the implications of FM development in each key area. Findings – FM evolves and matures continuously. It is important for FM organizations and practitioners to recognize the dynamic nature of this industry sector, based on which they can develop appropriate strategies to adapt to changing circumstances. This is probably the only way for them to keep pace with the times. Originality/value – Both backward looking and forward looking are crucial to the development of an industry sector. However, existing studies on FM development are conducted through either review or outlook. On the other hand, most of these studies focus on one particular management area or one particular industry sector. Based on 30 expert interviews, this research attempts to bridge the knowledge gap and analyze the trend of FM development in a systematic way. A better understanding of the trend provides a possibility and a guide for FM organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930825232

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a combined multi-functional method that includes a review of the theories behind HMI for GUIs as its first approach. Consequently, heuristic evaluations were conducted to identify usability problems in a professional context. Ultimately, thematic interviews were conducted with property managers and service staff to determine special needs for the interaction of humans and the built environment. Findings: The heuristic evaluation revealed that not all the studied applications were complete when the study was done. The significant non-motivational factor was slowness, and a lighter application means the GUI is more comfortable and faster to use. The evaluators recommended not using actions that deviate from regular practice. Proper implementation of the GUI would make it easier and quicker to work on property maintenance and management. The thematic interviews concluded that the GUIs form an excellent solution that enables communication between the occupant, owner and service provider. Indoor conditions monitoring was seen as the most compelling use case for GUIs. Two-dimensional (2D) layouts are more demonstrative and faster than three-dimensional (3D) layouts for monitoring purposes. Practical implications: The study provides an objective view of the strengths and weaknesses of specific types of GUI. So, it can help to select a suitable GUI for a particular environment. The 3D view is not seen as necessary for monitoring indoor conditions room by room or sending a service request. Many occupants’ services can be implemented without any particular layout. On the other hand, some advanced services were desired for the occupants, such as monitoring occupancy, making space reservations and people tracking. These aspects require a 2D layout at least. The building information model is seen as useful, especially when monitoring complex technical systems. Originality/value: Earlier investigations have primarily concentrated on investigating human–computer interaction. The authors’ studied human–building interaction instead. The notable difference to previous efforts is that the authors considered the GUI as a medium with which to communicate with the built environment, and looked at its benefits for top-level processes, not for the user interface itself. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078759567
