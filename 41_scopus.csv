Among other new and innovative wireless networks, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have emerged as highly flexible and dynamic facets that are being deployed in almost every type of environment whether it is rural, suburban or urban in nature. The most adaptive and innovative research avenues are being considered in an urban environment, where WSN deployment is especially demanding due to its harsh and perverse channel conditions. We have chosen WSN deployment in an urban environment as linchpin of our research. As each application scenario is different from the other, therefore WSN solution for each application has to be adaptive and innovative. We have discussed each application of WSNs in urban areas in detail with all the problems related to it and in the end, technical solution to those problems has been discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This entails project managers to design, implement, and maintain a systematic approach for construction progress monitoring to promptly identify, process and communicate discrepancies between actual and as-planned performances. To achieve this goal, this research focuses on exploring application of unsorted daily progress photograph logs available on any construction site as a data collection technique. Our approach is based on computing-from the images themselves-the photographer's locations and orientations, along with a sparse 3D geometric representation of the as-built site using daily progress photographs and superimposition of the reconstructed scene over as-planned 4D models. Within such an environment, progress photographs are registered in the virtual as-planned environment and this allows a large unstructured collection of daily construction images to be sorted, interactively browsed and explored. In addition, sparse reconstructed scenes superimposed over 4D models allow site images to be geo-registered with the as-planned components and consequently, location-based image processing technique to be implemented and progress data to be extracted automatically. The results of progress comparison between as-planned and as-built performances are visualized in the D4AR (4D Augmented Reality) environment using a traffic light metaphor. We present our preliminary results on three ongoing construction projects and discuss implementation, perceived benefits and future potential enhancement of this new technology in construction, in all fronts of automatic data collection, processing and communication. © 2009 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350154917

This paper particularly considers the case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find, recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds automatically. Previous research has also shown that ""Scan-vs-BIM"" systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works, thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking, automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and identification metric. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such information directly supports control decision-making and if automated, can significantly impact management of a project. This paper presents a new automated approach for recognition of physical progress based on two emerging sources of information: (1) unordered daily construction photo collections, which are currently collected at almost no cost on all construction sites; and (2) building information models (BIMs), which are increasingly turning into binding components of architecture/engineering/construction contracts. First, given a set of unordered and uncalibrated site photographs, an approach based on structure-from-motion, multiview stereo, and voxel coloring and labeling algorithms is presented that calibrates cameras, photorealistically reconstructs a dense as-built point cloud model in four dimensions (three dimensions + time), and traverses and labels the scene for occupancy. This strategy explicitly accounts for occlusions and allows input images to be taken far apart and widely distributed around the environment. An Industry Foundation Class-based (IFC-based) BIM is subsequently fused into the as-built scene by a robust registration step and is traversed and labeled for expected progress visibility. Next, a machine-learning scheme built upon a Bayesian probabilistic model is proposed that automatically detects physical progress in the presence of occlusions and demonstrates that physical progress monitoring at schedule activity level could be fully automated. Finally, the system enables the expected and reconstructed elements to be explored with an interactive, image-based, three-dimensional (3D) viewer where deviations are automatically color-coded over the IFC-based BIM. To that extent, the underlying hypotheses and algorithms for generating integrated four-dimensional (4D) as-built and as-planned models plus automated progress monitoring are presented. Experimental results are reported for challenging image data sets collected under different lighting conditions and severe occlusions from two ongoing building construction projects. This marks the presented model as being the first probabilistic model for automated progress tracking and visualization of deviations that incorporates both as-planned models and unordered daily photographs in a principled way. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920815816

In the case of materials such information can only be derived from appearance-based data contained in 2D imagery. Currently, the state-of-the-art texture recognition algorithms which are often used for recognizing materials are very promising (reaching over 95% average accuracy), yet they have mainly been tested in strictly controlled conditions and often do not perform well with images collected from construction sites (dropping to 70% accuracy and lower). In addition, there is no benchmark that validates their performance under real-world construction site conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new vision-based method for material classification from single images taken under unknown viewpoint and site illumination conditions. In the proposed algorithm, material appearance is modeled by a joint probability distribution of responses from a filter bank and principal Hue-Saturation-Value color values and classified using a multiple one-vs.-all χ2 kernel Support Vector Machine classifier. Classification performance is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms both in computer vision and AEC communities. For experimental studies, a new database containing 20 typical construction materials with more than 150 images per category is assembled and used for validation. Overall, for material classification an average accuracy of 97.1% for 200×200 pixel image patches are reported. In cases where image patches are smaller, our method can synthetically generate additional pixels and maintain a competitive accuracy to those reported above (90.8% for 30×30 pixel patches). The results show the promise of the applicability of the proposed method and expose the limitations of the state-of-the-art classification algorithms under real world conditions.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902439119

In this paper, we aim to study the expansion of the digital twin in including building life cycle management and explore the benefits and shortcomings of such implementation. In four rounds of experimentation, more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building facade element.

Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of data acquisition has created information intensive work environments, which can result in information overload and thus negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction. Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance the process of information extraction from building information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of workers’ tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency through improving the information retrieval process during construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual information retrieval methods (control group), with information retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results revealed that the participants using the artefact were approximately 50% faster in completing their experiment tasks, and committed less errors, when compared to the control group. This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick Response markers can significantly improve the information retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration has the potential to enhance task efficiency. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032836702

In large-scale construction projects, the process of monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data produced in the form of schedules, reports and photo logs. In order to address the mentioned methodological and technical gap, this paper presents a framework and a proof of concept prototype for on-demand automated simulation of construction projects, integrating some cutting edge IT solutions, namely image processing, machine learning, BIM and Virtual Reality. This study utilised the Unity game engine to integrate data from the original BIM models and the as-built images, which were processed via various computer vision techniques. These methods include object recognition and semantic segmentation for identifying different structural elements through supervised training in order to superimpose the real world images on the as-planned model. The proposed framework leads to an automated update of the 3D virtual environment with states of the construction site. This framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the inconsistencies in an effective manner.

However, early assessment of delays or accelerations during the phase of construction enables the adjustment of subsequent and dependent tasks. Manually performed, this involves many human resources if as-built information is not immediately available. This is particularly valid for indoor environments, where a general overview of tasks is not given. In this paper, we present a novel method that increases the degree of automation for indoor progress monitoring. The novel method recognizes the actual state of construction activities from as-built video data based on as-planned BIM data using computer vision algorithms. To achieve that, two main steps are incorporated. The first step registers the images with the underlying 4D BIM model. This means the discovery of the pose of each image of a sequence according to the coordinate system of the building model. Being aware of the image origin, it allows for the advanced interpretation of the content in consecutive processing. In the second step, the relevant tasks of the expected state of the 4D BIM model are projected onto the image space. The resulting image regions of interest are then taken as input for the determination of the activity state. The method is extensively tested in the experiment section of this paper. Since each consecutive process is based on the output of preceding steps, each process of the introduced method is tested for its standalone characteristics. In addition, the general manner of applicability is evaluated by means of two exemplary tasks as a concluding proof of the success of the novel method.

However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or her performance using MR. To address these topics, a quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally, nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because many of the participants had substantial prior experience constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for communicating existing BIM content to current industry practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not currently observed through the use of a paper-based communication methods. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032980879

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

It turned out that low precision 3D scanning devices, which are closely observing active workplaces, are sufficient for correct identification of the built elements. Such scanning devices are small enough to fit onto workers’ protective helmets and on the applied machinery. In this way, workers capture all workplaces inside and outside of the building in real time and record partial point clouds, their locations, and time stamps. The partial point clouds are then registered and merged into a complete 4D as-built point cloud of a building under construction. Identification of as-designed BIM elements within the 4D as-built point cloud then results in the 4D as-built BIM. Finally, the comparison of the 4D as-built BIM and the 4D as-designed BIM enables identification of the differences between both models and thus the deviations from the time schedule.

The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis.

Jobsite training offered by qualified organisations and associations for the oil and gas industry is very limited, and the relevant training facilities and centres that have been established or considered in the construction agenda are far from sufficient to the growing standard of operators and industry expansion. This paper, underpinned by advanced innovative visualisation technologies, proposes a framework to improve efficiency and expedite the process of developing the complex procedural skills in operating and maintaining oil and gas facilities, through identifying scientific principles of enabling complex procedural learning approaches, developing proficiency-based learning approaches and corresponding learning curricula, and appraising learning outcomes according to developed skillset taxonomy. The proposed framework is tested under the development of an innovative and immersive Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality training system, which reveals significantly pragmatic benefits in terms of boosting up workforce productivity while bringing down rework. It is also demonstrated that embedding paradigms of transformative learning process while pedagogically adopting Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in curricula development and assessment regimes can help the sector significantly improve workforce safety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026882295

In collaboration with a leading supplier of building materials, we explore the opportunities offered by digital silo twin capabilities. Focusing on fill level monitoring we identify diverse opportunities for generating informational, automational and transformational business value.

This paper presents an algorithm for automated quantification of discrepancies for components of assemblies. Rather than using dense point clouds, the geometric skeleton (wireframe) of assemblies is extracted for further manipulation, once the as-built status is captured using the appropriate method. The extracted skeletons, which abstractly represent the designed and built states, are registered using a constrained iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. In order to identify the points making up each straight segment, the skeletons are clustered, and a straight line is fit to each resulting cluster. The corresponding segments in both states are then compared and investigated for quantifying the incurred discrepancy in the form of a rigid transformation.

To overcome these limitations and exploit the rich project knowledge from the design phase, the authors propose taking advantage of the extensive geometric-semantic information provided by Building Information Models.

In the approach presented here, a 3D representation of the as-built state is calculated from photogrammetric images using multi-view stereo reconstruction.

The three scenarios are evaluated based on the ability of automation, the required effort for acquisition, the necessary equipment and its maintaining, disturbance of the construction works, and on the accuracy and completeness of the resulting point clouds. Based on the experiences during the test cases the following conclusions can be drawn: Terrestrial acquisition has the lowest requirements on the device setup but lacks on automation and coverage. The crane camera shows the lowest flexibility but the highest grade of automation. The UAV approach can provide the best coverage by combining nadir and oblique views, but can be limited by obstacles and security aspects.

In these methods, the expected performance typically is modeled with 4D BIM, and the actual performance is sensed through the 3D image-based reconstruction method or laser scanning. Previous research on 4D augmented reality (4D AR) models - which fuse 4D BIM with point clouds generated from daily site photologs - and also laser scan versus BIM, have shown that it is possible to conduct occupancy-based assessments, and as an indicator of progress, detect whether BIM elements are present in the scene. However, to detect deviations beyond typical work breakdown structure (WBS) in 4D BIM, these methods also need to capture operation-level details (e.g., current stage of concrete placement: formwork, rebars, concrete). To overcome current limitations, this paper presents methods for sampling and recognizing construction material from image-based point cloud data and using that information in a statistical form to infer the state of progress. The proposed method is validated using the 4D AR model generated for a building construction site. The preliminary experimental results show that it is feasible to sample and detect construction materials from the images that are registered to a point cloud model and use frequency histograms of the detected materials to infer the actual state of progress for BIM elements. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904635729

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies. © 2021 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103484819

The comparison of as-planned schedules against the as-built status of construction enables the involved parties to determine project performance. Periodic monitoring of project performance enables timely identification of discrepancies between the schedule baseline and the project schedule. The rapid identification of discrepancies allows necessary measures to be taken to minimize the impact of a delay on the construction workflow. In transportation projects, the traditional means of acquiring as-built data from a construction site prevents involved parties from receiving the required information from the site in a timely manner. The delay in the communication of information ultimately causes subsequent delays in implementing necessary courses of action targeted toward improving the workflow. Therefore, this project develops a technology-supplemented progress monitoring approach. The approach implements as-built data with a high level of detail is obtained from a jobsite within a reasonable period of time using lidar technology while ensuring the safety of the data collector. The proposed framework utilizes point cloud data obtained using mobile lidar technology and 4D design models to identify deviations of the performed work from the planned work. The framework was tested using as-built data acquired from an on-going bridge construction project, and Percentage of Completion (POC) for the as-built bridge elements are calculated and compared with the as-planned POC. The differences between these two POC values for every element, on a particular scan date, are used for assessing the performance of the proposed framework. The obtained POC difference values ranged from −7% to 6% for most elements, which shows that the developed framework enables tracking the completion of individual bridge elements in an accurate and efficient manner. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073708812

Construction workers' unsafe behaviors has been criticized as a key driving factor of construction safety incidents. A variety of studies indicate that social influence greatly affects workers' safety behaviors. However, the social influence on workers' safety behaviors in hazardous situations has not been well explored, partially due to the difficulty of simulating hazardous situations in the real world. To overcome this limitation, this research utilized a multi-user virtual reality (MVR) system with motion tracking function to simulate hazardous scenarios to study how social influence affects construction workers' safety behaviors. A hazardous virtual environment with a plank between two high-rise buildings was created to simulate the high-rise walking scenarios of iron workers in construction projects. A human-subject experiment (n = 126) was conducted to investigate the role of social influence in a simulated scenario involving walking across a narrow plank between two virtual high-rise buildings. The participants walked through the plank in the virtual environment while observing different scenarios, such as seeing a person slowly walking across the plank or falling from the plank. Participants' behaviors, such as the time taken to walk across the plank, were recorded and analyzed to understand effects of social influence. The results of the experiment indicate that social influence played an important role in safety behaviors in the virtual hazardous situation.

Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety managementmethods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the BeijingWinter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions. © 2020 by the authors.

This has confirmed that the technical limitations of the construction progress tracking through the point cloud do not exist, and that a fairly high degree of progress data which contains efficiency and accuracy can be collected. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085696398

These efforts range from 2D photo feature extraction to 3D laser scanners and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. A multi-sensor data fusion model that would utilize multiple sources of information would provide a better alternative than a single-source model for tracking project progress. However, the existing fusion models are based on data fusion at the sensor and object levels, and therefore, are incapable of capturing critical information regarding non-structural trades and activities on a construction site, such as welding, inspection and installation activities. This paper presents an activity-based data fusion model, which incorporates an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) positioning system to track activities in a construction project.

The scope of the experimental program was limited to ductwork, HVAC, and piping activities on the project, but the model, experiments, and results are scalable to a complete construction project. A comparison of concrete, steel, and piping projects showed that for piping projects, where the asbuilt environment may be substantially different than as-designed models, the activity-based progress estimation model of this paper can be fused with existing object-based models to provide a more accurate and reliable progress estimate. © 2012 ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866251644

Nonetheless, without appearance information, operation-level monitoring - formwork vs. concrete surfaces for concrete placement - is still challenging. By leveraging the interconnectivity of site images and BIM-registered point clouds, this paper presents a new method for densely sampling and extracting 2D patches from all site images from which BIM elements are expected to be visible. Our method reasons about occlusions in the scene and classifies the material in each image patch. By formalizing the sequencing knowledge of construction operations for progress monitoring purposes and using histogram-based representation for possible types of construction materials, our method can accurately detect the current state-of-progress for BIM elements in the presence of occlusions.

The primary data involves the responses collected from 695 respondents belonging to the north region of India using a convenience sampling technique. Structural equation modeling analysis has been employed to examine the dimensions' impact on customer purchase intention. Findings: The results concluded that dimensions such as increasing energy prices, product knowledge and experience, financial support and subsidies, perceived cost, have a positive influence on customers' purchase intention of solar water heater except for the dimension of “solar water heater aesthetics”.

To ensure that the acquired point clouds are suitable to any given application, data collection must guarantee that all scanning targets are acquired with the specified data quality, and within time limits. Efficiency of data collection is important to reduce jobsite activity disruptions. Effective and efficient laser scanning data collection can be achieved through a prior planning optimisation process, which can be called Planning for Scanning (P4S). In the construction domain, the P4S problem has attracted increasing interest from the research community and a number of approaches have been proposed. This manuscript presents a systematic review of prior P4S works in the AEC domain and presents a categorisation of point cloud data quality criteria. The review starts with the identification and grouping in three categories of the point cloud data quality criteria that are commonly considered as constraints to the P4S problem. The three categories of data quality criteria include 1) completeness, 2) accuracy and spatial resolution, and 3) ‘registrability’. The prior P4S works are then reviewed in a structured way by contrasting them in the way they formulate the P4S optimisation problem: the type of inputs they assume (model and possible scanning locations), the constraints they consider, and the algorithm they utilise to solve the optimisation problem. This work makes two contributions: (1) it identifies gaps in knowledge that require further research such as the need to establish a fully automated scan plan which provides the optimum coverage in construction domain specifically for indoor construction; and (2) it provides a framework — principally a set of criteria — for others to compare new P4S methods against the existing state of the art in the field. This will not only be valuable for young researchers who want to start research in solving the P4S problem, but also for the ones already working in the domain to rethink the problem from different perspectives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101305094

The premise, which simplifies the analysis, is that the cracking would localize into wider cracks if and only if there is a size effect. The size effect can be completely avoided only if, for the same cross-section area, the tensile strength of yielding reinforcement is greater that the tensile strength of concrete. The effect of increasing the reinforcement ratio is also explored. The calculations indicate that fracture mechanics can, and should, be used to check ductility and size effect implications in the two-sided reinforced members, boundary beams, and more complicated designs such as in shear walls. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105975555

Currently, this task is a manual, time-consuming activity. BIM-based progress monitoring facilitates the automated comparison of the actual state of construction with the planned state for the early detection of deviations in the construction process. In this chapter, we discuss an approach where the actual state of the construction site is captured using photogrammetric surveys. From these recordings, dense point clouds are generated by the fusion of disparity maps created with semi-global-matching (SGM). These are matched against the target state provided by a 4D Building Information Model. For matching the point cloud and the model, the distances between individual points of the cloud and a component's surface are aggregated using a regular cell grid. For each cell, the degree of coverage is determined. Based on this, a confidence value is computed which serves as a basis for detecting the existence of a respective component. Additionally, process- and dependency-relations provided by the BIM model are taken into account to further enhance the detection process. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063561288

Recently, technological advancements have allowed the visualization of the 3D BIM content on construction sites using smart phones, tablets, portable computers, and site computer kiosks. Furthermore, researchers have experimented with using virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) to visualize the design overlaid on existing features in its final intended location on site, which allows for a more immersive viewing environment. Using MR in conjunction with head mounted displays (HMD), the user can experience a hands-free visualization of the model, which in turn expands the capabilities of workers on site. However, two of the major problems facing the MR visualization on site are the stabilization of a full-scale model contents and the accuracy of the location on site. Providing an accurately sized and placed model on site offers several advantages: For example, quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) processes, where quick and easy comparison between the built project and the plans can be achieved. This paper presents a workflow that allows the projection of full-scale MR content in its correct final location by leveraging marker based MR and existing survey points that are typically found on construction sites. The workflow was validated through implementation on a large construction site in Arizona as an efficient and accurate means of QA/QC. Future work will aim to further streamline and automate this process to get the model from its native BIM software to the desired MR device more seamlessly. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Using SRM originating from recycling a broad range of inorganic waste materials (e.g., mining waste, different industrial wastes, construction, and demolition waste) has been recognized as a promising, generally more cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to the exploitation of natural resources. Despite the benefits of using SRM, several challenges need to be addressed before using SRM even more. One of them is the long-term durability and little-known response of construction works built using such alternative materials. In this paper, we present the activities to establish a fully functioning digital twin (DT) of a road constructed using SRM.

However, data exchange between BIM and VR is a complex and time consuming process, which has limited VR applications in practice. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel method that enables an efficient interoperability of BIM and VR including geometry of each element along with required semantic data of the BIM model. In this method, geometry and semantic data are extracted from BIM models through an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file, which is then optimized to be efficiently imported and recreated into the VR environment. The backward communication is performed by converting XML file to IFC, which is then imported to the BIM application. A prototype was developed to implement the proposed methodology. A building case study was used to demonstrate the capability of the method including considerably short transfer time, high quality rendering and geo-semantic data exchange for design and construction. These capabilities promote VR applications in the AEC/FM industry as the required information for design and construction plan review including Architectural parameter (e.g., material, texture and dimensions), Engineering parameters (e.g., loads, R-Value), cost, schedule and clashes can be exchanged between BIM and VR in near real time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096230895

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to offer a computer vision method that can jointly reason about geometry and appearance of observed BIM elements in site images and videos to monitor and report on their state of progress. The new method fuses structure-from-motion geometrical features together with directional and radial appearance features in a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to detect and classify state of work-in-progress.

To increase the effectiveness of UAV-captured data, inspection mission plans should be designed prior to site visits. The data collection locations must be identified and adjusted based on the user's objectives. The UAV flight mission must guarantee a visit to each identified location, and the inspection plans must satisfy the constraints imposed by safety requirements, no-fly zones, and UAV's limited battery life. This problem becomes more complicated indoors due to complex and continuously changing building layouts. This work uses four-dimensional (4D) building information models (BIM) to automatically design optimal UAV mission plans in support of indoor UAV-enabled data acquisition. It automatically identifies the inspection targets based on users' customizable and multicriteria description of objectives (e.g., columns behind schedule). The three-dimensional (3D) navigable space is automatically calculated by time stamping the 4D models based on the inspection date. The navigable space is further refined based on safety rules.

The integration of the IP camera and the developed software allowed for automatic as-built quantity extraction for the concreting in columns, concreting in beams, and block masonry, which were the bulk construction activities. As-planned quantities were imported to the MATLAB interface to compare with as-built quantities, hence providing progress comparative assessment. For instance, the as-planned quantity for column B6 was 20.630 cft. After analysis, the result was 91.5%, which was the percentage completion of the as-built quantity in comparison to the as-planned quantity.
