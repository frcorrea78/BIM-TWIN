Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

This requires the acquisition of data from various sources followed by the transformation of these data into an appropriate format. The integration and representation of heterogeneous data in a GIS are very important for use cases involving both BIM and GIS data, such as in the management of municipal facilities. We propose a BIM/GIS-based information Extract, Transform, and Load (BG-ETL) architecture that separates geometrical information from that related to the relevant properties. The property required for each use-case perspective is extracted and transformed from information for the BIM with FM to GIS using the ETL concept. In consideration of the viewpoint of geometry, the surface model for several representations in the GIS, we designed BG-ETL, developed a prototype, and verified the results through interviews. The results show that BG-ETL considering BIM/GIS integration issue has benefits such as reusability and extensibility. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. Elsevier B.V.

These important attributes are now optimized by trial and error because the essential process variables cannot currently be selected from scientific principles. A recourse is to build and rigorously validate a digital twin of the additive manufacturing process that can provide accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variations of metallurgical parameters that affect the structure and properties of components. Key building blocks of a computationally efficient first-generation digital twin of laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing utilize a transient, three-dimensional model that calculates temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates, solidification parameters and deposit geometry. The measured profiles of stainless steel 316L and Alloy 800H deposits as well as the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and Vickers hardness measurements are used to validate the proposed digital twin. The predicted cooling rates, temperature gradients, solidification rates, SDAS and micro-hardness values are shown to be more accurate than those obtained from a commonly used heat conduction calculation. These metallurgical building blocks serve as a phenomenological framework for the development of a digital twin that will make the expanding knowledge base of additive manufacturing usable in a practical way for all scientists and engineers. © 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021415524

Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University’s city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and challenges of BIM in FM applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931458663

This study proposes an FMM framework based on BIM and facility management systems (FMSs), which can provide automatic scheduling of maintenance work orders (MWOs) to enhance good decision making in FMM. In this framework, data are mapped between BIM and FMSs according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) extension of maintenance tasks and MWO information in order to achieve data integration. After bi-directional data transmission between the BIM models and FMSs, work order information is visualized in BIM via API to identify components that have failed. Second, geometric and semantic information of the failure components is extracted from the BIM models to calculate the sub-optimal maintenance path in the BIM environment. Third, the MWO schedule is automatically generated using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers four factors, namely, problem type, emergency level, distance among components, and location.

In fact, the information related to the O&M management of the MEP system conventionally comes from the completion documents in the forms of hard copies or unstructured digital files, making it hard to search for useful information in the “sea” of documents and drawings. Therefore, digitalization of information is an urgent task to facilitate the intelligent management of the MEP system.

Subsequently, a cross-platform O&M management system is developed using the MEP-related information in the as-built model to run routine O&M tasks and to effectively response to MEP-related emergencies.

Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

Data acquisition systems such as wireless sensor networks can help to monitor facilities to reduce hazards such as fire, water flooding and burglaries. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a revolutionary development that is reshaping the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. BIM is both a process and a technology, offers wide solutions for facilities management. In order to monitor and manage facilities data in a BIM based simulated environment, this work reports upon a development of a system that uses BIM software and a wireless sensor technology to develop a proactive safety management system. However, to link BIM data with data values of wireless sensors motes will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and massive sensor data will contribute to the emerging model of big data. To extract relevant information out from the collected data, a prototype system uses Hadoop architecture for data storage and processing. The results of processing BIM and sensor data in a Hadoop architecture have demonstrated that proposed system can effectively provide data visualizations to facility managers with the most accurate information needed to make decisions. It also ultimately attempts to reduce safety hazards during the facility management phase of a building. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043460281

The objective of this study is to enhance facility management efficiency using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. A data management module is first developed to collect maintenance records. A statistical module is then established to graphically display the collected data. Maintenance activities are sequenced using a scheduling module to ensure that the facility functions normally. A forecast module is developed using fuzzy neural networks to avoid facility malfunction before the next maintenance. These four modules are integrated into a web-based RFID facility management system. System performance is validated using an actual building. Two RFID apparatuses are invented based on operational needs when implementing the developed system. The validation results show that integrating RFID technology with a web-based system, database, scheduling theory, artificial intelligence and enhancing apparatuses can improve facility maintenance efficiency. This study is one of the first researches providing a comprehensive solution for enhancing facility management efficiency. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872535120

Currently, there has also been an increased amount of interest generated towards construction operations building information exchange (COBIE). A data exchange format for facility management data handover, COBIE allows extracting asset information from a BIM model and provides a provision of importing this facility data into a buildings computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). Recent development in sensors and monitoring devices in building controls with wireless connection capabilities offers a huge potential for applications in smart buildings and building maintenance. This paper describes the development of an application that integrates sensor data collected using a wireless sensor network, and reports the data via the virtual model of the building. The application was developed to aid the facility management personnel with early detection of issues and maintenance checks. The data collected from the sensors is integrated with COBIE equipment information affected by this sensor data. The integration of equipment information and sensor data is accessible to onsite personnel and facility managers allowing easy access to field conditions and maintenance information during maintenance checks. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021739627

Similarly the energy consumption costs and the maintenance costs are the largest expense component for the property sustainment budget. The performance of these O&amp;M activities needs to be measured annually and monitored to support long-term cost saving strategies. This study demonstrates the application of three dimensions (3D) object-oriented database supporting the facilities management benchmarking project. As case study the 3D object hierarchy of the Central Building of the Graphisoft Park in Budapest was presented. The objective of the current study may provide feasibility workflow diagram and prototype for organizations that start to collect benchmark data from their own buildings. The main objectives were to specify the access of data in Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) system, and to elaborate a methodology to gathering building O&amp;M costs data with the core outcome that is usable for further quantitative analysis included hypothesis testing. To achieve this objective, based on a questionnaire survey new sample of data collected on facility management factors, sites (n=76) and buildings on the sites (n=207) from the range of Hungarian Corporate Real Estates were participated. Data mining techniques included Descriptive Statistics, Correlation Analysis, one-way ANOVA and Box Plot was used to identify significant relationships to determine differences in annual O&amp;M costs by age, number of users and heritage. This study presents new results where negative correlation between maintenance costs and age of the facilities was found. ANOVA was obtained (p&lt;0.05), the number of users of buildings has a significant positive effect and explain almost 60% of annual utility costs of facilities. Identical to the hypothesized nearly 100% higher mean annual maintenance cost per m2 was measured between heritage and non heritage facilities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
