In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033877788

Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH by about 100 to 300% when 1%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies. © 2002 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949089156

In its early days it was criticised as being a ""hype topic"" or a rebadging of some Multi Agent Systems work. In this survey, we hope to show that this was not indeed 'hype' and that, though it draws on much work already carried out by the Computer Science and Control communities, its innovation is strong and lies in its robust application to the specific self-management of computing systems. To this end, we first provide an introduction to the motivation and concepts of autonomic computing and describe some research that has been seen as seminal in influencing a large proportion of early work. Taking the components of an established reference model in turn, we discuss the works that have provided significant contributions to that area. We then look at larger scaled systems that compose autonomic systems illustrating the hierarchical nature of their architectures. Autonomicity is not a well defined subject and as such different systems adhere to different degrees of Autonomicity, therefore we cross-slice the body of work in terms of these degrees. From this we list the key applications of autonomic computing and discuss the research work that is missing and what we believe the community should be considering. © 2008 ACM.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449088961

The objective of this paper is twofold. The first one is to deploy sensor nodes at optimal locations such that the theoretically computed network lifetime is maximum. The second is to schedule these sensor nodes such that the network attains the maximum lifetime. Thus, the overall objective of this paper is to identify optimal deployment locations of the given sensor nodes with a pre-specified sensing range, and to schedule them such that the network lifetime is maximum with the required coverage level. Since the upper bound of the network lifetime for a given network can be computed mathematically, we use this knowledge to compute locations of deployment such that the network lifetime is maximum. Further, the nodes are scheduled to achieve this upper bound. In this paper, we use artificial bee colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization for sensor deployment problem followed by a heuristic for scheduling. A comparative study shows that artificial bee colony algorithm performs better for sensor deployment problem. The proposed heuristic was able to achieve the theoretical upper bound in all the experimented cases. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892398564

Different from the traditional wireless networks and ad hoc networks, the energy constraint of WSNs makes energy saving become the most important goal of various routing algorithms. For this purpose, a cluster based routing algorithm LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) has been proposed to organize a sensor network into a set of clusters so that the energy consumption can be evenly distributed among all the sensor nodes. Periodical cluster head voting in LEACH, however, consumes non-negligible energy and other resources. While another chain-based algorithm PEGASIS (power- efficient gathering in sensor information systems) can reduce such energy consumption, it causes a longer delay for data transmission. In this paper, we propose a routing algorithm called CCM (Chain-Cluster based Mixed routing), which makes full use of the advantages of LEACH and PEGASIS, and provide improved performance. It divides a WSN into a few chains and runs in two stages. In the first stage, sensor nodes in each chain transmit data to their own chain head node in parallel, using an improved chain routing protocol. In the second stage, all chain head nodes group as a cluster in a self- organized manner, where they transmit fused data to a voted cluster head using the cluster based routing. Experimental results demonstrate that our CCM algorithm outperforms both LEACH and PEGASIS in terms of the product of consumed energy and delay, weighting the overall performance of both energy consumption and transmission delay. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865271620

Further, we propose the schematic taxonomy of key design issues for WSN routing protocols. We also define design factors categorization relevant to secure routing: basic, essential, and optional.

This study proposes and implements a novel stochastic physics-based optimisation algorithm that is both efficient (guarantees full target coverage with a reduced number of sensors) and scalable (meaning that it can be executed for very large-scale problems in a reasonable computation time). The algorithm employs 'virtual sensors' which move, merge, recombine, and 'explode' during the course of the algorithm, where the process of merging and recombining virtual sensors reduces the number of actual sensors while maintaining full coverage. The parameters which control sensor merging and explosion are varied during the algorithm to perform the same function as an annealing schedule in simulated annealing.

Coverage enables us to evaluate the supervision quality of each point within an area of interest. In this paper, we address the problem of target coverage in wireless sensor networks. This concern is trivial if each target must be covered by a single sensor. However, it becomes an NP-complete problem when the choice of the position of the sensor must take into account the targets that it should cover in its vicinity. Using a multi-objective evolutionary-based approach, we propose a stochastic method to search for network configurations that achieve good coverage with the fewest sensors.
