However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

Due to the consistency of design data with quality data and construction process with quality control process, the potential of BIM implementation in quality management lies in its ability to present multi-dimensional data including design data and time sequence.

In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049913864

The method leverages 4D Building Information Models (BIM) and 3D point cloud models generated from site photologs using Structure-from-Motion techniques. To initialize, a user manually assigns correspondences between the point cloud model and BIM, which automatically brings in the photos and the 4D BIM into alignment from all camera viewpoints. Through reasoning about occlusion, each BIM element is back-projected on all images that see that element. From these back-projections, several 2D patches are sampled per element and are classified into different material types. To perform material classification, the expected material type information is derived from BIM. Then the image patches are convolved with texture and color filters and their concatenated vector-quantized responses are compared with multiple discriminative material classification models that are relevant to the expected progress of that element. For each element, a quantized histogram of the observed material types is formed and the material type with the highest appearance frequency infers the appearance and thus the state of progress. To validate, four new datasets of incomplete and noisy point cloud models are introduced which are assembled from real-world construction site images and BIMs. An extended version of the Construction Material Library (CML) is also introduced for training/testing the material classifiers. The material classification shows an average accuracy of 92.4% for CML image patches of 100 × 100 pixels. The experiments on those four datasets show an accuracy of 95.9%, demonstrating the potential of appearance-based recognition method for inferring the actual state of construction progress for BIM elements. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we focus on the technical part of EWSs, i.e., the prediction and timely recognition of imminent hazards, as well as on monitoring slopes at risk and released mass movements. Recent innovations in assessing spatial precipitation, monitoring and precursors of the triggering and deformation of RMM offer new opportunities for next-generation EWSs. However, technical advancement can only be transferred into more reliable, operational EWSs with an adequate well-instructed dedicated staff.

This paper focuses on the built environment, where its constituting elements (buildings and infrastructure) are characterised by long lifespans, numerous stakeholders, and hundreds of components and ancillary materials that interact dynamically in space and time. To facilitate the pathway towards circularity, we have attempted to identify the barriers to and enablers for the circular economy within the built environment. This will form the basis of future work to build consensus on the future development of the circular economy.

Since it is important to evaluate such a replacement from the environmental point of view, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried out in order to compare the environmental impacts of the construction of asphalt wearing courses with the use of siliceous aggregates (the ""conventional scenario""), and the use of alternative, steel slag aggregates (the ""alternative scenario""). The main advantage of the alternative scenario is that a reduction can be achieved in the consumption of natural aggregate, as well as in the quantity of slag deposited on landfill sites. On the other hand larger amount of bitumen is needed as a binder. However, the results of the Life Cycle Assessment (based on consequential modelling) revealed that the alternative scenario is to be significantly preferred if the following impact categories are taken into account: Acidification, Eutrophication, Photochemical Ozone Creation and Human Toxicity. In the case of the discussed indicators, the impacts are reduced to a level equal to about 80% of the conventional scenario impacts. This benefit was additionally evaluated by means of a transport sensitivity analysis, which provided results which could be useful for road managers working on case studies using similar construction materials. The alternative scenario is more sustainable than the conventional scenario with regard to the discussed impact categories even when taking into account long delivery distances of the steel slag aggregate (∼100 km) and minimal delivery distances of the siliceous aggregate. Considering similar delivery distances in both scenarios, the alternative scenario was found to be beneficial also with regard to the Global Warming, but only when the delivery distance of the steel slag aggregates did not exceed 160 km. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this framework, the present paper shows an application in the field of geotechnical engineering of the BIM based design approach to the case of an underground line. It is a tunnel excavated by means of traditional method, currently under construction. The project defines, in a central BIM model, a detailed tunnel structure model integrated with geological-geotechnical information for the definition of the subsoil 3D model. Once the BIM model of the tunnel stretch under study was completely defined, it was imported into a finite element (FE) model to perform deformation analyses. Thus, BIM-to-FEM-to-BIM interoperability was exploited in order to verify the maturity level of the BIM approach in the field of application for geotechnical infrastructures. Finally, the BIM fourth dimension (4D) was also implemented in the central model for the time management of the tunnel excavation process, synchronized with the numerical model. The BIM based procedure proposed in the present work can be considered as a case study in the technical literature of I-BIM for tunnels, putting in evidence limitations and advantages: i) a high level of BIM maturity was not yet achieved in the infrastructures field; ii) the BIM-to-FEM interoperability seems to be not fully effective and many operations still require the manual intervention; iii) the FEM-to-BIM interoperability brings back all geotechnical choices and hypothesis to the central BIM model, linking the models into a continuously interoperable circuit; iv) an important part of the design of civil infrastructures consists of addressing geotechnical aspects, hence the inclusion of ground conditions and geotechnical data into the BIM model can improve the quality and the usefulness of the model, not only during the design phase but also, and in particular, during the construction and the lifecycle management of the infrastructure, as a support to decision making process especially in urban context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097469503

To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis. The overarching aim of this paper is to improve the efficiency of facility management (FM) and utilize BIM data accessible during building's lifecycle. The university engineering building equipped with a monitoring system for tracking and collecting various building-related parameters is used for demonstration of the developed software technologies. This study demonstrates how BIM-sensor integration can lead to more responsive building management and operation by making sensor data tangible and accessible for property managers, owners, and occupants. © 2019 The author(s).

However, the existing monitoring systems still need improvements in data interoperability and smart sensing. This paper established a new monitoring framework based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and IoT (Internet of Things) Technology. In this proposed framework, BIM is used to maintain the 3D data of the building, while a time-series database called InfluxDB is introduced for storage of monitoring data. Then, a monitoring server based on Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol is established, providing a low-cost and reliable communication. Meanwhile, Arduino microcontrollers with some sensors are adopted as the nodes of the monitoring network, aiming to collect real-time data of the environment and upload the data to the server. Finally, a prototype system is developed to demonstrate the proposed framework. Testing of the developed system and corresponding IoT sensors shows that combination of BIM and IoT technology provides a comprehensive view of the status of the buildings and improves the efficiency of information utilization. © 2018, © 2018 Korea Institute for Structural Maintenance and Inspection.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062019225

As part of this, they invest extensive funds in large infrastructure projects which are challenging to deliver as they require an e efficient communication among different professions, in order to share information efficiently throughout the lifecycle of the project, thus highlighting the importance of standardization to maintain consistency and integrity during data exchange. Building Information Modelling (BIM) aims to facilitate the above- mentioned requirements by describing the life-cycle of the project and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the Standard for BIM that enables an efficient storage, management, exchange and visualization of information. However, there are two important challenges that need to be addressed: (i) IFC focuses particularly on buildings and provides limited support for infrastructure elements and (ii) the information exchange aims to describe mostly the construction phase; highlighting the lack of classes that refer to the operation and maintenance phase. Within this context, this paper proposes the extension of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) for Asset Management in Infrastructure. A method is developed based on a case study of three highway entities: (i) retaining wall, (ii) gantry and (iii) bridge and a conceptual extension is presented. The results are further discussed and recommendations regarding future research fields are proposed. © Authors 2019. CC BY 4.0 License.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077959762

They were made possible by the cooperation of ever-larger groups of people. Construction has been no exception. However, specialization leads to fragmentation - unless specialization is supported by approaches and technologies that enable people to work together and that systems are interoperable. When it comes to interoperability, the construction sector is often considered special, but it is not incomparable to other industries. Methodologically, this paper is based on the frameworks developed in the field of Enterprise Information Systems. It considers interoperability as a means to achieve a goal. Novel is the understanding that the ultimate goal is neither integration nor more efficient construction but rather the division of labour and specialization. A comparison of approaches to interoperability with those in other areas reveals some gaps. Research in construction information technology has focused on one type of interoperability - semantic interoperability - intending to achieve computer integrated construction. There are other types of interoperability - legal and organizational - and other levels of interoperability - federated and unified. These also deserve investigation. In the future, there will be a growing number of systems that would need to be made interoperable, especially in connection with the construction 4.0’s Internet of Things, sensors, intelligent systems, etc. Since interoperability problems are caused by the emerging specializations, the problems of interoperability will never go away. The industry will have to recognize that it will always operate in an environment where interoperability is challenged. While research will continue working towards making systems interoperable and integrated it would need also to give attention to exploring collaboration in environments that are only partially interoperable. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100253439

Tools such as the light weight deflectometer (LWD) allow for quantification of the stiffness of subgrade materials during construction. However, a major limitation of the LWD is its inability to provide subgrade stiffness information over the entire project site. The development of continuous compaction control (CCC) has provided the ability to collect near continuous measurements of compaction effort information during the compaction process through the instrumentation of compaction rollers. In this study, LWD and CCC measurements (compactometer value, CMV) were collected during active construction of a roadway. Target modulus values from LWD measurements were determined utilizing AASHTO TP 123-17 to indicate passing and failing LWD tests collected in the field. This study examined general trends between recorded localized CMV measurements and local passing and failing LWD measurements, to assess the utility of CMV as a quality assurance tool for earthwork construction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081129346

At present, it is difficult to inspect the condition of infrastructure while it is being used. The fragility of old infrastructure presents a challenge for new construction in congested urban environments. Little is also known of the long-term performance of such infrastructure. We see many cases around the world of continuous retrofit/renovation of infrastructure during its lifetime. The vision discussed in this chapter is to significantly improve our capability in predicting and managing the life expectancy of large infrastructure. For future proofing, active monitoring of construction and operational processes of civil engineering infrastructure is essential. This implies that structures are instrumented to assess their performance against engineering design parameters or predictive models. In recent years, sensor and communications research has been undergoing a revolution. There are possibilities to use emerging sensor technologies (distributed fiber optics sensing, wireless sensor network, low power miniature sensors, energy harvesting for continuous monitoring, robotic inspections, satellite images, crowd source data, etc.) to address the particular needs to look after our infrastructure. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082351528
