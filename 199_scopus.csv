This paper contributes in solving this problem by applying automated safety rule checking to Building Information Models (BIM). Algorithms that automatically analyze a building model to detect safety hazards and suggest preventive measures to users are developed for different cases involving fall related hazards. As BIM is changing the way construction can be approached, the presented work and case studies extend BIM to include automated hazard identification and correction during construction planning and in certain cases, during design. A rule-based engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents before construction starts. The safety area reviewed is fall protection. An example case study of such a system is also provided. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869092675

Safety has always been advocated by many construction companies, and they have been working hard to make sure their employees are protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training and evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of technical features and types that could be implemented in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated, while significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and identification, safety training and education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works.

Failure to adequately manage risks may not only lead to difficulties in meeting project objectives but also influence land-use planning and urban spatial design in the future growth of cities. Due to the rapid development and adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and BIM-related digital technologies, the use of these technologies for risk management has become a growing research trend leading to a demand for a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of these developments. This paper presents a summary of traditional risk management, and a comprehensive and extensive review of published literature concerning the latest efforts of managing risk using technologies, such as BIM, automatic rule checking, knowledge based systems, reactive and proactive IT (information technology)-based safety systems. The findings show that BIM could not only be utilised to support the project development process as a systematic risk management tool, but it could also serve as a core data generator and platform to allow other BIM-based tools to perform further risk analysis. Most of the current efforts have concentrated on investigating technical developments, and the management of construction personnel safety has been the main interest so far. Because of existing technical limitations and the lack of “human factor” testing, BIM-based risk management has not been commonly used in real environments.

A safety management system implements safety management activities, so an overview of definitions of safety and safety management sheds light on the content of an SMS. SMSs emerged from the risk concept and safety defences. The development of SMSs was boosted by research into 'safety’, ‘management’ and 'system’ theories, (safety) risk analysis techniques, safety audit tools, and related standards. Consequently, the study of SMSs became a multidisciplinary topic and through modelling SMSs, a generic framework can be established aiding the effectiveness of SMSs. There are two main groups of models informing SMSs: (1) accident related models, and (2) organisational models. The relationship between these two models is outlined in this paper. Moreover, we discuss that SMSs studies and models are developed for two main purposes: control and compliance. To control means by implementing safety systems or subsystems, an SMS is able to control risks and to improve continuously, as well as comply with the appropriate standard management systems. As the key to implementing a functional SMS is to carry out common managerial processes, we map the elements of various SMSs to a generic SMS to explore the extent to which they correspond.

Falls remain a major concern as they contribute to very serious injuries or even fatalities on construction projects around the world. Since the standards and rules for protective safety equipment vary by country, the growing numbers of internationally operating companies are in need of tools that allow ubiquitous understanding and planning of safety regardless of the country where they operate. The problem is examined using a customizable automatic safety rule-checking platform for building information models. The applied rule-based checking algorithms are designed to be add-ons to existing building information modelling (BIM) software and can check models for safety hazards early in the design and planning process. Once hazards have been identified preventative safety equipment can be designed, estimated, and included in the construction schedule before construction starts. A case study implements the safety rule-checking platform on a high-rise building project. Fall protection regulations from both the USA and Germany are applied to the developed rule-checking platform. Visualization of the safety information further explains the differences in the results once country-specific safety-regulative standards are applied on the same building information model. The case study also indicates that the role of BIM in safety design and planning can effectively assist the traditional safety decision-making process for fall protection equipment. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884282759

The paper describes the underlying philosophy and application procedure of AR and highlights its strengths and weaknesses. Then, the applicability of the method to CEM is illustrated through a case study of improving access to information to support planning and decision making in a construction owner organization through designing and implementing a data warehouse.

Project Management Triangle) of projects. Developing project schedules is almost always troublesome, since it is heavily dependent on project planners' knowledge of work packages, on-the-job-experience, planning capability and oversight. Having a thorough understanding of the project geometries and their internal interacting stability relations plays a significant role in generating practical construction sequencing. On the other hand, the new concept of embedding all the project information into a 3-dimensional representation of a project (a.k.a. Building Information Model or BIM) has recently drawn attention to the construction industry. In this paper, the authors demonstrate a novel approach of retrieving enough information from the BIM of a project and then develop construction sequencing for the installation of the project elements. For this reason a computer application is developed that can automatically derive a structurally (statically) stable construction sequence, using the concept of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The term ""structurally stable sequencing"" in this article refers to the sequencing order of erection in which the structure remains statically stable locally and globally during the entire installation process. To validate the proposed methodology, the authors designed 21 different experiments and used the proposed method for generating stable construction schedules, which all were successfully accomplished. Therefore, this methodology proposes a novel approach of construction project application of the GA, as an Expert System tool. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These accumulated data have the potential to provide deep information that can help improve facility management. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

Thus, interpersonal influences among workers play a crucial role in forming and affecting construction workers' safety behaviors. The social learning literature indicates that interpersonal learning occurs in two opposing ways – positive reinforcement by demonstrating preferred behaviors, and negative reinforcement by demonstrating negative consequences of inappropriate behaviors. Amid theoretical disagreements in the social learning literature, it remains unclear in the construction safety literature how the two reinforced learning methods affect construction workers in safety training. To fill the gap, a human-subject experiment (n = 126)was conducted to investigate people's social learning behaviors in a hazardous construction situation – walking between two high-rise buildings. The experiment utilizes a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR)system with a motion tracking feature. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (no instruction was given), not-falling group (participants observed an avatar demonstrating appropriate walking behaviors), and falling group (participants watched an avatar quickly walking across a plank and falling off). Indicators, including walking time on the plank, walking speed, and gaze movement, were recorded and analyzed to quantify the effects of the two reinforced learning methods. The results indicate that demonstrating information with positive consequences (not-falling group)encourages people to follow the demonstration and maintain normal walking in a hazardous situation. Showing information with negative consequences (falling group)induced participants to walk faster and more irregularly, which further led to more mistakes and unsafe behaviors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VR in safety studies and provides recommendations for better safety training programs. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064642464

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode.

Despite strong enforcement of construction best practices and regulations, accidents in construction industry are comparatively higher than other industries. Likewise, significant increase in injuries and fatalities are recently reported on geotechnical activities such as excavation pits and trenches. Academic researchers and industry professionals have currently devoted vital attention to acquire construction safety in preconstruction phase of the project. They have developed various algorithms to enhance safety in preconstruction phase such as automated generation of scaffolding and its potential risk analysis, checking BIM model for fall risks, and limited access zone allocation in wall masonry. However, safety in geotechnical works at preconstruction phase is yet unexplored. This paper proposed automatic safety rule compliance approach for excavation works leveraging algorithmic modeling tools and BIM technologies. The focused approach comprises of the following three modules: information extraction and logic design (IELD), information conversion and process integration (ICPI), and automodeling and safety plan generation (ASPG). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to major risks such as cave-ins, fall, safety egress, and prohibited zones risks. A set of rules-based algorithms was developed in commercially available software using visual programming language (VPL) that automatically generates geometric conditions in BIM and visualizes the potential risks and safety resources installation along with their quantity take-off and optimized locations. A case study has been presented to validate the proof of concept; automated modeling tool for excavation safety planning generated the required results successfully. It is anticipated that the proposed approach has potential to help the designers through automated modeling and assist decision makers in developing productive and practical safety plans compared to the conventional 2D plans for excavation works at the preconstruction phase. Moreover, it is realized that the same approach can be extended to other rule-dependent subjects in construction. © 2019 Numan Khan et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065607604

The basic definition of NER is that of “any occupational risk that is both new and increasing”, existing several studies carried out by the EU-OSHA where the set of the above mentioned risks is identified and analyzed, both general and specific. However, as demonstrated in recent studies, the direct use of this set of NER in risk assessment techniques, generally applied in industrial processes and in particular those characterized by advanced technology, may result in the identification of TR instead of NER, mainly due to the fact that they have been defined without following a risk reference model. In order to solve this problem, a risk model that improves and complements the EU-OSHA's NER definition has been developed with the abovementioned investigations. However, this model has two limitations. First, the model does not contemplate the possibility of considering independently the new risks (NR) and increasing risks (IR). Second, this model does not allow monitoring NER evolution over time, therefore it is not currently possible to determine, in general, the temporary validity of such risks. Thus, the main objective of this work is to develop a theoretical framework for the modeling of the NER that allows its monitoring through the technology lifecycle (TLC), especially in industrial processes. To develop this framework, first it has been carried out an analysis of the limitations previously mentioned as well as the related literature. In this way, a theoretical context that allows to justify and argue properly the development of three new models for the NER, NR and IR has been set up. These named models allow, on the one hand, characterizing and differentiating the new qualities from the increasing qualities associated to risk. On the other hand, these models allow defining a set of risk typologies. These typologies have been associated with risk evolutionary phases likely to be integrated into the TLC, especially of a given industrial process, allowing monitoring over time of its NER. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006483237

In the construction management field, this paper demonstrates that indoor positioning enables five significant applications that considerably enhance work efficiency and safety on construction sites. Without a perfect indoor positioning system and under complicated site environment, developing a suitable on-site indoor positioning system is challenging and essentially user-oriented and environment-specific. This paper analyses the challenges to implement on-site indoor positioning systems, and proposes indoor positioning performance metrics, namely APP-CAT, for evaluating indoor positioning systems. The fundamental indoor positioning principles are first discussed and evaluated. Subsequently, the top 10 indoor positioning technologies, selected by their performance in APP-CAT and their popularity, are thoroughly compared. The promising trends of indoor positioning development, e.g., indoor positioning hybridization, game theory positioning, and integration with BIM models, are highlighted. © 2020",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086501854

To bridge this gap, this paper developed a facility risk assessment and maintenance system prototype that will enable facility managers to select the maintenance policy for a single piece of equipment and determine the maintenance priorities of equipment components in the initial stage of operation and maintenance (O&M). The maintenance policy was selected by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and facility risk assessment based on fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) was performed to determine the maintenance priorities of equipment components. In this way, the failure modes of the equipment components and the risk order can be analyzed to support facility maintenance decision-making. A facility maintenance system that has embedded policy and maintenance decisions was then developed. Disruptive technologies, such as BIM and augmented reality (AR), were applied to guide the maintenance processes.
