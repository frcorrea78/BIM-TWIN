However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019987476

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long ""lookahead"" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers.

To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement.

Results and methodologies of 17 empirical studies were tabulated and comparatively analyzed to find a conclusive answer whether the green building costs more or less than its conventional counterpart. Yet, consensus is not reached, and a significant gap exists in the quantified cost premium range.

The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity.

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062655898

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels.

'Digital Twins' in engineering provide a conceptual framework to analyze these emerging data-driven health care practices, as well as their conceptual and ethical implications for therapy, preventative care and human enhancement. Digital Twins stand for a specific engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the concept of 'normality' or 'health,' as a set of patterns that are regular for a particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the 'asymptomatic ill' and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data privacy. © 2018 Bruynseels, Santoni de Sio and van den Hoven.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042098524

The eRobotics methodology addresses this evolution by providing platforms where roboticist can exchange ideas and collaborate with experts from other disciplines for developing complex technical systems and automated solutions. Virtual Testbeds are the central method in eRobotics, where complex technical systems and their interaction with prospective working environments are first designed, programmed, controlled and optimized in simulation before commissioning the real system. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 concepts promote the notion of 'Digital Twins', virtual substitutes of real world objects consisting of virtual representations and communication capabilities making up smart objects acting as intelligent nodes inside the internet of things and services. Combining these two approaches, Virtual Testbeds and Digital Twins, leads to a new kind of 'Experimentable Digital Twins' breaking new ground in the simulation-based development and operation of complex technical systems. In this contribution, we describe how such 'Experimentable Digital Twins' can act as the very core of simulation-based development processes streamlining the development process, enabling detailed simulations at system level and realizing intelligent systems.

In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process. © 2018 by the authors.

In four rounds of experimentation, more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building facade element. This is performed to point out the method of implementation, highlight the benefits gained from digital twin, and to uncover some of the technical shortcomings of the current Internet of Things systems for this purpose. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077738936

Over the last decades, a paradigm shift has been occurring in the industry at large, with the adoption of a Circular Economy model, that aims at keeping the materials in a closed loop to retain their maximum value, therefore with a greater potential of reducing the waste generation and resources extraction for the Construction Industry. This article aims at finding the recent developments of how Circular Economy can be used inside the construction industry. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted, including 45 articles that were divided into six areas of research: development of Circular Economy, reuse of materials, material stocks, Circular Economy in the built environment, LCA analysis and material passport. An analysis of the content of these articles was made and the knowledge gaps in this area were identified, as well as table with known Circular Economy practices for the Construction Industry was created divided by life cycle stages.

As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues.

The current approach to training workers relies primarily on instilling practice and experience in conventional teacher-apprentice settings on and off site. Both have their limitations however, on-site training is very inefficient and interferes with progress on site, while off-site training provides little opportunity to develop the practical skills and awareness needed through hands-on experience. A more effective way is to train workers in safety awareness and efficient working by current novel information technologies. This paper describes a new and innovative prototype system - the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS) - to train precast installation workers to be highly productive while being fully aware of the hazards involved. PCMS uses Chirp-Spread-Spectrum-based (CSS) real-time location technology and Unity3D-based data visualisation technology to track construction resources (people, equipment, materials, etc.) and provide real-time feedback and post-event visualisation analysis in a training environment. A trial of a precast facade installation on a real site demonstrates the benefits gained by PCMS in comparison with equivalent training using conventional methods.

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage.

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s.

In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

However, advanced applications of these technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) businesses remain nascent. While it is in demand, the use of these technologies in developing the AEC digital pedagogy and for improving professional competence have received little attention. This paper presents a set of five novel digital technologies utilising virtual and augmented reality and digital twin, which adds value to the literature by showing their usefulness in the delivery of construction courses. The project involved designing, developing, and implementing a construction augmented reality (AR), including Piling AR (PAR) and a virtual tunnel boring machine (VTBM) module. The PAR is a smartphone module that presents different elements of a building structure, the footing system, and required equipment for footing construction. VTBM is developed as a multiplayer and avatar-included module for experiencing mechanisms of a tunnel boring machine. The novelty of this project is that it developed innovative immersive construction modules, practices of implementing digital pedagogy, and presenting the capacity of virtual technologies for education. This paper is also highly valuable to educators since it shows how a set of simple to complex technologies can be used for teaching various courses from a distance, either in emergencies such as corona virus disease (COVID-19) or as a part of regular teaching.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized.

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema. A case study using part of an office building and the results of its analysis are provided and discussed from the perspectives of applicability and accuracy.

The work uses conventional terrestrial LIDAR together with affordable VR hardware and freely available software development kits originally intended for authoring computer games. The resulting VR app is evaluated for a case study involving a typical masonry bridge, comparing the proposed technique with traditional inspection methods. The new approach promises to be highly effective in terms of interpretation of results, accessibility to critical areas and safety of inspectors. The work represents an important step towards the creation of digital twins of important assets in the built environment. Recent bridge collapse incidents have affected local economies, traffic congestion, and in some extreme cases led to a loss of life. The work is timely as law making agencies are paying greater attention to structural rehabilitation.

Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways.

This project aims to conduct a systematic critical review including a bibliography analysis on delay literature in construction. The main questions consider what has been learnt from a decade investigating delay causes and effects in the construction literature and what factors have been missed in the literature. This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt. In addition, the paper identifies 30 critical factors with the frequency of occurrences over three times in the DEC dataset and computes their medians of ranking. This paper also discusses digital tools and methods that can be used for delay analysis and preventions, including MS Project, Oracle Primavera P6, and Open Plan by Deltek. The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas. In total, four overlooked factors are identified and suggested, including faulty data analysis, unmatched structure of the research questionnaires with new knowledge and standards [e.g., Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)], overlooked effects of digital technologies [e.g., Digital twin, Navisworks, Building Information Model (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)], and ignored job-site technologies. In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified. This would significantly help to utilise digital systems to prevent time overruns in different construction contexts. © 2019 by the authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073122692

The recent trend has been to use larger cranes on smaller vessels, which makes the lifting operation more complex and potentially dangerous. The use of digital twins (DTs) is emerging as one way to enable safer operations, real-time simulation, and maintenance prediction. On offshore vessels, a DT can monitor the lifting operation to create a safer work environment. The SPADE (stakeholders, problem formulation, alternatives, decision making, and evaluation) model has been used as a framework toward the creation of a DT of cranes on offshore vessels. Several cases involving simulation of cranes revealed the lack of an adequate simulation of cable and pulleys suitable for use in a DT. The simulation is important for accurate results and for implementation in control systems. A trade study was performed to determine a numerical method adequate for cable and pulley simulation.

These problems should be continuously improved and enhanced for smart cities. Building information modeling (BIM) has been revolutionary in construction industry applications; it integrates different kinds of construction information into a 3D digital model and can be applied in all stages of a project lifecycle. Furthermore, the wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important key technology in Internet of Things (IoT) development. In order to improve the performance of environmental monitoring management of parking garages in smart cities, this study proposes a planning approach for integration of WSN and BIM technologies and develops an advanced monitoring and control system for underground parking garage environment monitoring, adopting WSN and BIM technologies for digital twin (DT) application of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Many WSN nodes with sensing and control capabilities were placed in a parking garage to collect carbon monoxide (CO), temperature, and humidity conditions in real time. All the collected information was transferred by a WSN self-constituted network, and the different location conditions were integrated and dynamically displayed on corresponding spatial components of a 3D BIM model. The proposed system was applied in a case study of a parking garage in Taipei to verify the system and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is a visually effective monitoring system for environmental monitoring management.

Furthermore, most experts now agree that conservation management of heritage places based on a common understanding of their cultural values is essential to address all the particularities of their contexts. Recently, significant research has demonstrated the potential of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) for the collaborative data management in conjunction with conservation projects. The recent development of HBIM web platforms illustrates the value of strengthening the link between the digital model and the physical realm of heritage assets. This paper advocates the application of Digital Twin's (DT) principles, using HBIM models as a digital replica, to support the preventive conservation of heritage places. Based on an extensive literature review, a comprehensive framework that integrates the DT into the management plan process for the preventive conservation of built heritage is proposed. Several recommendations for its implementation are finally discussed, such as the identification of tangible features of significance, the threats associated with their integrity and the corresponding mitigation strategies, with particular emphasis on the value assessment process. The result is a data model for structuring information on preventive conservation strategies.

This mismatch between the company's view and the ontological constraints can limit or even jeoparize the adoption of modern formal ontologies in industry. We study the roots of this problem and individuate a general set of principles to relate the ontology and those non-ontological entities that are yet important for the core business of the company.

Today, if the number of spot welds in a sub-assembly is more than 10, the sequence optimisation will be a challenging and time-consuming task. Therefore, industry is mainly dependent on the experiential approach or simultaneous welding simulations for predicting the geometrical outcome.

This semi-active digital twin model is an attempt to link noninvasive video of a patient face to the percentage of carotid occlusion. The pulsatile nature of blood flow through the carotid arteries induces a subtle head vibration. This vibration is a potential indicator of carotid stenosis severity, and it is exploited in the present study. A head vibration model has been proposed in the present work that is linked to the forces generated by blood flow with or without occlusion. The model is used to generate a large number of virtual head vibration data for different degrees of occlusion. In order to determine the in vivo head vibration, a computer vision algorithm is adopted to use human face videos. The in vivo vibrations are compared against the virtual vibration data generated from the coupled computational blood flow/vibration model. A comparison of the in vivo vibration is made against the virtual data to find the best fit between in vivo and virtual data.

Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in Fm. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data.

Preliminary results show that increasing magnitude of electrical current can cause significant degradation. On the other hand, multi-physical behavior depends on local microstructure and resulting anisotropic nature of composite material. Details of expreimnetal procedure, results and a framework for future modeling approaches has been reported. © 2012 AIAA.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881323822

The application of drones is one such technology, favored for their features of safety, functionality and sustainability in the processes of infrastructure health monitoring. Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPAs) commonly known as drones have been acknowledged as the next great technology in civil infrastructure inspection. However, very limited research has been done to prove the advantages of the technology such as safety, effectiveness and cost savings. Building this bank of proof is essential for bridge authorities looking to improve bridge health monitoring into the 21st century. Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPAs) offer considerablepotential in conducting visual inspection with high level of accuracy and minimum risk to bridge inspectors, allowing a bridge to be inspected without the need to use under-bridge inspection units or walk across the deck. This can pointedly reduce the overall inspection costs and disruption caused to the public. Furthermore, utilisation of Aerial Photogrammetry assists bridge engineers to better understand a situation through the 3D spatial context offered by RPAs. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104101496

Digital twin has been applied in the transportation industry through BIM+GIS technology. The interaction of various transportation infrastructure model elements and the rational construction of twin data have become the bottleneck restricting its development. In the 3D GIS environment, with the guidance of digitally-generated five-dimensional structural model, a specific implementation technique for geometric, physical, and regular models that the virtual model should contain was proposed. The classification of transportation infrastructure and the characteristics of twin data were analyzed. Then, the layer relationship of its components was refined and the scheme of identification coding and storage of models was implemented. Furthermore, the system software was classified according to CAMP5, and the verification method was explained according to each layer to complete the system verification. Based on the virtual model and data fusion, the ideas of application development of pixel layer, representation layer and decision layer were combed, which could provide technical references for achieving digital twin in the traffic field. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.
