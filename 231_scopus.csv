These models, often represented as complex triangle meshes, challenge rendering performance, transmission bandwidth, and storage capacities. This paper introduces the progressive mesh (PM) representation, a new scheme for storing and transmitting arbitrary triangle meshes. This efficient, loss-less, continuous-resolution representation addresses several practical problems in graphics: smooth geomorphing of level-of-detail approximations, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement. In addition, we present a new mesh simplification procedure for constructing a PM representation from an arbitrary mesh. The goal of this optimization procedure is to preserve not just the geometry of the original mesh, but more importantly its overall appearance as defined by its discrete and scalar appearance attributes such as material identifiers, color values, normals, and texture coordinates. We demonstrate construction of the PM representation and its applications using several practical models.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030383840

This paper proposes a novel technique, called Topology Matching, in which similarity between polyhedral models is quickly, accurately, and automatically calculated by comparing Multiresolutional Reeb Graphs (MRGs). The MRG thus operates well as a search key for 3D shape data sets. In particular, the MRG represents the skeletal and topological structure of a 3D shape at various levels of resolution. The MRG is constructed using a continuous function on the 3D shape, which may preferably be a function of geodesic distance because this function is invariant to translation and rotation and is also robust against changes in connectivities caused by a mesh simplification or subdivision. The similarity calculation between 3D shapes is processed using a coarse-to-fine strategy while preserving the consistency of the graph structures, which results in establishing a correspondence between the parts of objects. The similarity calculation is fast and efficient because it is not necessary to determine the particular pose of a 3D shape, such as a rotation, in advance. Topology Matching is particularly useful for interactively searching for a 3D object because the results of the search fit human intuition well.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035156965

Perlis Many natural and man-made objects exhibit significant symmetries or contain repeated substructures. This paper presents a new algorithm that processes geometric models and efficiently discovers and extracts a compact representation of their Euclidean symmetries. These symmetries can be partial, approximate, or both. The method is based on matching simple local shape signatures in pairs and using these matches to accumulate evidence for symmetries in an appropriate transformation space. A clustering stage extracts potential significant symmetries of the object, followed by a verification step. Based on a statistical sampling analysis, we provide theoretical guarantees on the success rate of our algorithm. The extracted symmetry graph representation captures important high-level information about the structure of a geometric model which in turn enables a large set of further processing operations, including shape compression, segmentation, consistent editing, symmetrization, indexing for retrieval, etc. Copyright © 2006 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749237312

For objective evaluation, we collect a large number of query sketches from human users that are related to an existing data base of objects. The sketches turn out to be generally quite abstract with large local and global deviations from the original shape. Based on this observation, we decide to use a bagof-features approach over computer generated line drawings of the objects. We develop a targeted feature transform based on Gabor filters for this system. We can show objectively that this transform is better suited than other approaches from the literature developed for similar tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how to optimize the parameters of our, as well as other approaches, based on the gathered sketches. In the resulting comparison, our approach is significantly better than any other system described so far. © 2012 ACM 0730-0301/2012/08-ART31.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872227693

In this survey paper, we examine 3D mesh compression technologies developed over the last decade, with the main focus on triangular mesh compression technologies. In this effort, we classify various algorithms into classes, describe main ideas behind each class, and compare the advantages and shortcomings of the algorithms in each class.

Only pure boundary representations that cannot be parametrically edited are transferable [Geometric Modeling: Theory and Practice (1997)]. There are two approaches for the exchange of design intents such as parameters, features, and constraints. The first is an explicit approach based on constraints between pre-defined parameters and features. The second is a procedural approach based on the sequence of operations issued to construct the models. The authors have previously proposed a macro-parametric approach [International Journal of CAD/CAM 2 (2002) 23], which is a variation of the procedural approach. In this approach, CAD models can be exchanged in the form of macro files, which include the history of modeling commands. To exchange CAD models using the macro-parametric approach, a set of standard modeling commands should be defined. This paper introduces a set of standard commands and explains the process of developing the set. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041329650

It is essential to persistently name the topological entities referenced by the feature. This problem is known as the persistent naming problem. The persistent naming problem is divided into naming and name matching. The persistent naming problem is an important issue in the exchange of feature-based CAD models through a neutral format. If a CAD model contains only construction history, the naming of the topological entities is required during translation. However, if a CAD model contains modification history as well, name matching is also required. In a previous study, the authors proposed a naming method for exchanging feature-based CAD models. In this study, a solution to the name matching problem is proposed and its technical details are discussed. The proposed name matching method is based on the local matching technique, using topology merging and splitting history. The feasibility of the proposed name matching method has been demonstrated through experiments with a prototype CAD model translator. © 2012 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870273684
