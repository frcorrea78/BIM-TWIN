They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

A few special landscapes may have 'universal' or 'outstanding' values, but almost all landscapes will be valued in multiple ways by those people who are closely associated with them. It is important that those making decisions affecting landscapes are aware of the potential nature and range of cultural values, particularly where these values are not accounted for using standardised landscape assessment techniques. This article describes the development of the Cultural Values Model, which offers an integrated conceptual framework for understanding the potential range of values that might be present within a landscape, and the potential dynamics between these values. The model emerged out of community-based research undertaken in two landscapes in New Zealand, and is discussed in the context of the contribution that landscapes can make to cultural identity and sustainability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This approach involves a 3D modeling stage and the integration of the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further management and analysis. The modeling stage is carried out using a new concept; Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) which has been developed at the Dublin Institute of Technology [12]. Historic Building Information Modeling is a system for modeling historic structures from laser scan and photogrammetric data using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded scripting language within the BIM software called Geometric Descriptive Language (GDL). These objects are combined and mapped onto the survey data to build the entire model. After the 3D model has been created the next stage involves integrating the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further analysis. The international framework for 3D city modeling, CityGML has been adopted for this purpose. CityGML provides an interoperable framework for modeling 3D geometries, semantics, topology and appearance properties [13]. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between parametric CAD modeling and 3D GIS while using benefits from both systems to help document and analyze cultural heritage sites. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872036464

Laser scanners are widely used to achieve this goal since they permit to collect information about object geometry in form of point clouds and provide a large amount of accurate data in a very fast way and with a high level of details. Unfortunately, the scan-to-BIM (Building Information Model) process remains currently largely a manual process which is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach is presented for the 3D reconstruction of indoors of existing buildings from point clouds. Several segmentations are performed so that point clouds corresponding to grounds, ceilings and walls are extracted. Based on these point clouds, walls and slabs of buildings are reconstructed and described in the IFC format in order to be integrated into BIM software. The assessment of the approach is proposed thanks to two datasets. The evaluation items are the degree of automation, the transferability of the approach and the geometric quality of results of the 3D reconstruction. Additionally, quality indexes are introduced to inspect the results in order to be able to detect potential errors of reconstruction. © 2017 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031418399

It allows the creation of virtual building models, which can be linked to numerical data, texts, images, and other types of information. Building components, such as walls, floors, etc. are modelled as “smart objects”, i.e. they are defined by numerical parameters, such as dimensions, and are embedded with other kinds of information, such as building materials and properties. Stored data are accessible and modifiable by all different professionals involved in the same project. The BIM process has been developed for new buildings, and it allows to plan and manage the whole building life-cycle. BIM for built heritage has started to be researched recently, and its use is still not widespread. Indeed, built heritage is characterised by complex morphology and non-homogeneous features, which clash with BIM’s standardised procedures. Moreover, to date, BIM does not allow fully automated procedures to model heritage buildings. This review focuses on the survey and digitisation phases, which can be seen as the initial phases of application of BIM in conservation projects. It also briefly covers the modelling stage. Here we present the main methodologies developed for BIM for built heritage. Issues about digitisation are also highlighted, principally in connection with the unavailability of automated processes. During the last 10 years, research has led to promising results; for example, videogame interfaces have been used to simulate virtual 3D tours that display in a single interface the 3D model and the database containing metadata, and new software plug-ins have been developed, to easily create “smart objects”. Nevertheless, further research is needed to establish how BIM can support the practice of building conservation. There is a gap in BIM’s information holding capacities, namely the storage of cultural and historical documentation, as well as monitored and simulated data relevant for preventive conservation. Future work should focus on the development of new tools that will be able to store and share all the relevant metadata. © 2018, The Author(s).",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047193517

It is suggested that value typologies are often designed and implemented without understanding the implicit consequences of the inclusion and omission of ‘values’. It is also suggested that typologies often fail to prompt the necessary questions to develop satisfactorily detailed understandings of heritage significance, resulting in decisions being based on implicit, rather than explicit, value assessments in practice. Mindful of the problems associated with ‘universalising’ context specific typologies, a broad framework for assessing and communicating significance is proposed. In order to encourage holistic approaches, the framework is designed to combat the false dichotomies of cultural/natural and tangible/intangible heritage; it is hoped this will make the framework widely applicable. Without downplaying the necessity of diverse participation in assessing significance, the framework is designed to identify aspects of weakness and preference in cases where adequate consultation is not possible. © 2016 L.

The current challenge still involves the extraction of geometric primitives and the establishment of their connection to heterogeneous knowledge. As a recently developed 3D information modeling environment, building information modeling (BIM) entails both graphical and non-graphical aspects of the entire building, which has been increasingly applied to heritage documentation and generates a new issue of heritage/historic BIM (HBIM). However, HBIM needs to additionally deal with the heterogeneity of geometric shape and semantic knowledge of the heritage object. This paper developed a new mesh-to-HBIM modeling workflow and an integrated BIM management system to connect HBIM elements and historical knowledge. Using the St-Pierre-le-Jeune Church, Strasbourg, France as a case study, this project employs Autodesk Revit as a BIM environment and Dynamo, a built-in visual programming tool of Revit, to extend the new HBIM functions. The mesh-to-HBIM process segments the surface mesh, thickens the triangle mesh to 3D volume, and transfers the primitives to BIM elements. The obtained HBIM is then converted to the ontology model to enrich the heterogeneous knowledge. Finally, HBIM geometric elements and ontology semantic knowledge is joined in a unified BIM environment. By extending the capability of the BIM platform, the HBIM modeling process can be conducted in a time-saving way, and the obtained HBIM is a semantic model with object-oriented knowledge. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069581674

In this study, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data from Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, and Sentinel-2A have been exploited along with spatial analysis to investigate the area of the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt), severely threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl.

As things stand at the moment, BIM and GIS could appear as complementary solutions, notwithstanding research work is currently under development to ensure a better level of interoperability, especially at the scale of the building.

The wireless sensor network data shows a very stable environment within the galleries, while the dense monitoring enables localized monitoring of subtle changes in air quality trends and impact of visitors on the microclimate conditions. The high spatial and temporal resolution data serves as a baseline study to understand the impact of visitors and building operations on the long-term preservation of art objects. © 2017 by the authors.

The ""DNA"" of Preventive Conservation. Various authors so far support the argument that preventive conservation is an effective way to respond to the challenges society faces with the preservation of its Cultural Heritage (Van Balen, 2013). A few decades of experiences with the application of preventive conservation in the field of immovable heritage in the form of Monumentenwacht in The Netherland and in Flanders have shown that a good monitoring of the state of preservation with a strong push for maintenance activities contributes to more preservation of authenticity, to more cost-effective preservation and to empowering society in dealing with heritage preservation. (Cebron, 2008) An analysis of these and similar experiences demonstrates that these ""Monumentenwacht"" activities represent only a part of what could be named a preventive conservation system. Other fields in which prevention is advocated for its higher efficiency, show the importance of system thinking in the development of improved strategies. Applying this approach to the field of the immovable heritage, referring to the initial results shown by the Monumentenwacht practices, it becomes clear that different dimension are at stake simultaneously: The preservation of authenticity or integrity, the management of resources and the connection with society. It shows that the analysis of challenges in heritage preservation and the development of strategies is à priori multifaceted and therefor has a certain level of complexity. The sustainability of the preservation of cultural heritage buildings and sites can be measured according to its multiple economic, social, environmental and cultural support. The Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe report shows that the more diverse the support is for cultural heritage preservation actions, the more those actions will contribute to sustainable development and the more sustainable the preservation of that heritage will be. This reasoning has led to the ""upstream approach"" which argues that cultural heritage preservation can benefit from a variety of resources which do not necessarily have to be earmarked for it à priori (CHCfE, 2015). It leads to arguing for an holistic and integrated approach for cultural heritage preservation that taps into different kinds of resources, which requires acknowledgement of the complex nature of understanding and managing heritage values into an overall societal development goal (Vandesande, 2017). © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030227912

Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) can provide benefits in managing heritage projects. However, the modelling task is laborious, BIM software tends to be complex, and historical databases are not synchronised with HBIM models. The aim of this research is to create an online work platform where interdisciplinary stakeholders can synchronise heritage information. Design Science Research (DSR) was the methodological approach adopted, consisting of designing an artefact and evaluating it iteratively. As a result, an innovative in-cloud system named BIMlegacy that connects the intrinsic HBIM database with heritage documentary databases was designed. BIMlegacy was used to manage a complete heritage registration project in a case study. The results were validated through a focus group with external professionals. The theoretical definition of the BIMlegacy platform structure is a contribution to knowledge as it could be used as a basis to develop new systems.

Abundant researches have gradually proven that Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) is a relevant alternative for the collaborative management of information related to existing structures. Apart from the obvious benefits of HBIM for information exchange among stakeholders during conservation project, the potential of such processes to support preservation strategies should not be neglected. Moreover, the recent developments of HBIM web-interfaces illustrate the need for additional investigation in strengthening the relationships between the digital model and the real-world to better support preventive conservation of heritage places. Besides, values-based approaches for the elaboration of conservation strategies have been gradually adopted in the last decades, both in academic and professional sector. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology to structure and integrate the cultural significance of tangible and intangible elements into HBIM models to be further taken into account in the analysis and simulation of data. This article suggests the application of Digital Twin (DT) principles to support site managers in the preventive conservation of their assets. Based on the analysis and simulations of data captured by onsite sensors, threats to the site integrity and corresponding preventive solution can be predicted in the DT environment. The integration and structuration of Heritage Values in HBIM models allow further evaluation process to estimate the impact of each suggested interventions on the conservation of features of significance. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Filarete, a well-known Renaissance architect and theorist, planned the hospital in the 15th century, but the ice house was built two centuries later with a double-storey irregular octagonal brick structure, half under and half above ground, that enclosed another circular structure called the ice room. The purpose of the double-walled structure was to store ice in the middle and store and preserve perishable food and medicine at the outer side of the ice room. During World War II, major portions of the hospital and the above-ground section of the ice house was bombed and heavily damaged. Later, in 1962, the hospital was restored and rehabilitated into a university, with the plan to conceal the ice house's remaining structure in the courtyard, which ultimately was excavated and incorporated into a new library for the university. A team of engineers, architects, and students from Politecnico di Milano and Carleton University conducted two heritage recording surveys in 2015 and 2016 to fully document the existing condition of the ice house, resulting in an inclusive laser scanner and photogrammetric point cloud dataset. The point cloud data was consolidated and imported into two leading parametric modelling software, Autodesk Revit© and Graphisoft ArchiCAD©, with the goal to develop two BIMs in parallel in order to study and compare the software BIM workflow, parametric capabilities, attributes to capture the complex geometry with high accuracy, and the duration for parametric modelling. The comparison study of the two software revealed their workflow limitations, leading to integration of the BIM generative process with other pure modelling software such as Rhinoceros©. The integrative BIM process led to the production of a comprehensive BIM model that documented related historic data and the existing physical state of the ice house, to be used as a baseline for preventive maintenance, monitoring, and future conservation projects. © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030234708

As-built BIM refers to a BIM representation of the “as-is” conditions of built heritage at the time of a survey. Determining the level of development (LoD) is crucial for as-built BIM owing to its relevance to model effects and modeling efforts. This study addresses this issue from the viewpoint of a brick structure based on a case study of a fifteenth-century ruin in Nanjing, China. Three LoDs are proposed based on the combined use of a commercial platform and auxiliary tools: A host model linked with raster images composed using orthoimage and relief maps (LoD 1), an as-built volume with semantic skins (LoD 2), and a brick-by-brick model with custom industry foundation class parameters at local areas (LoD 3). The results reveal that LoD 1 caters to an efficient web-based workflow for brick-damage annotations; as-built dimensions can be extracted from LoD 2; and LoD 3 enables attributes, such as damage types, to be attached at the brick level. In future studies, the detection of brick shapes is expected to automate the process of as-built surface mapping. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076685703

Information and Model are generally acquired under researches and analysis phases addressed to the preservation and restoration process.

Conservation is an important aspect of museum management cycle aiming to preserve cultural heritage objects in the best possible condition for future generations. Since cultural objects are susceptible to environmental changes, sensor data could be of significant importance in automatic environmental monitoring and possible conservation issues. Recently, many approaches have included the SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology in their domain knowledge representation and relevant applications. In this work, we merge the SSN using the CORE (Conservation Reasoning) ontology, an ontology which is based on empirical analysis, scientific knowledge and existing vocabularies of the conservation domain. Incorporating many of the existing properties of both ontologies and proposing additional ones, we integrate the majority of SSN classes in the CORE ontology, creating a new merged ontology that combines conservation procedures data and rules with sensor and environmental information. Furthermore, we create ontology-based rules, using the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), in order to express preventive conservation guidelines and rules based on sensor and object current data. © 2018 CEUR-WS.
