Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS.

This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors. The paper also proposes the definition of DT for Industry 4.0 manufacturing, elaborated by the European H2020 project MAYA, as a contribution to the research discussion about DT concept. © 2017 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029833606

This study analyzes the causal relationship between this degree of openness and performance, with an empirical analysis based on a sample representing local manufacturing units. Performance is measured by the extent of opportunities businesses obtain. The degree of openness is investigated using two indicators: breadth, or the number of technologies used; and depth, or the number of value chain stages involved. The regression models demonstrate that: (1) breadth and (2) depth of Industry 4.0 allow greater opportunities, and (3) micro-level local units achieve best performances. Verifying the opportunities for companies with Industry 4.0 is extremely relevant, as investments in Industry 4.0 are high in terms of costs, the acquisition of new skills, and the risks of obsolescence to enable better strategic decisions. This work also provides a scope for future analyses of this topic conducted on panel data. Despite the limited application of Industry 4.0, this study's results can encourage managers and policy-makers to implement a wider range of enabling technologies in the various stages of the value chain. © 2019 University of Turin",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074301976

Design: We introduce the Industry 4.0 paradigm, presents its background, current state of development and its influence on the development of the simulation modelling paradigm. Further, we present the multiple case study methodology and examine several research and development projects involving automated industrial process modelling, presented in recent scientific publications and conclude with lessons learned. Results: We present the research problems and main results from five individual cases of adoption of the new simulation modelling paradigm. Main lesson learned is that while the new simulation modelling paradigm is being adopted by big companies and SMEs, there are significant differences depending on company size in problems that they face, and the methodologies and technologies they use to overcome the issues. Conclusion: While the examined cases indicate the acceptance of the new simulation modelling paradigm in the industrial and scientific communities, its adoption in academic environment requires close cooperation with industry partners and diversification of knowledge of researchers in order to build integrated, multi-level models of cyber-physical systems. As shown by the presented cases, lack of tools is not a problem, as the current generation of general purpose simulation modelling tools offers adequate integration options. © 2017 Blaž Rodič, published by De Gruyter Open.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028767217

As a main actor of the enterprise integration, manufacturing control systems should be designed in order to answer these necessities of reactivity and profitability in a flexible way. Holonic manufacturing system (HMS) proposes a structure organized as a loosely coupled network of communicating and cooperating agents to solve this problem. Such approach offers concrete solutions to reconfigurability and evolvability issues of manufacturing control systems. This paper presents a manufacturing execution system (MES), using the HMS concepts, and illustrates this approach on a real industrial application.11American Glass Product (AGP; www.agpglass.com) supports and partially finances this project. Such a structure is based on a typology of manufacturing system elements (products, resources, orders). Roles and behaviours for these manufacturing control elements are proposed. Product holons own reference models of products, for manufacturing execution and quality control. Resources holons are components used as bricks with local intelligent decision-making system embedded. Based on characteristics of the tasks they perform, a specialisation of resource holons is proposed. Specific heuristics are suggested for each class of resource holon. Finally, order holons are related to product demand, manufacturing task and product item. They own models of product item and a time model of the manufacturing task. Mechanisms are proposed to synchronize the execution of manufacturing tasks. These mechanisms guarantee the availability of components and enable to impose time constraints on task scheduling. This MES implements a product-centred approach, as shown by the active and opportunistic behaviour of order holons. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, new technologies are being tested and adopted in industry to improve the performance of warehouse operations. An example technology that has recently gained interest by both academia and industry is augmented reality. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities arising from the usage of augmented reality in warehouses as well as the barriers for its industrial adoption. This is done via a series of practitioners interviews and via an experiment designed using Google Glass.

Reducing the gap between the real and digital world makes the factory environment more flexible, more adaptive, but also demand broader skill of human workers. Interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science are required in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart. This paper proposes a system architecture for a mixed-reality based learning environment, which combines physical objects and visualization of its digital content via Augmented Reality. It allows to make the dynamic interrelations between real and digital factory visible and tangible.

Using Building Information Modeling (BIM), a model is developed through multiple refinement stages to satisfy various design and engineering requirements. Such refinements of geometric and semantic information are described as levels of development (LOD). Thus far, there is no method to explicitly define an LOD's requirements nor to precisely specify the uncertainties involved. Furthermore, despite the insufficient information in the early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain, which can lead to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analyses. Hence, this paper presents a multi-LOD meta-model to explicitly describe an LOD's requirements, incorporating the potential fuzziness of both, geometric and semantic information of individual elements. The explicitly defined fuzziness can be taken into account when applying simulations or analyses for assessing the performance of different building design variants. To support the continuous elaboration of a building from the conceptual to the detailed design stages, the multi-LOD model makes it possible to ensure the consistency of the geometric and semantic information as well as the topological coherence across the different LODs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by its prototypical implementation as a web-server and user-interface, providing a means for managing and checking the exchange requirements both at the meta-level and for concrete building model instances. The paper is concluded with a case study of a real-world construction project that demonstrates the use of the meta-model to support model analysis and the decision-making process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064203465

The real-time transmission and analysis of collected data from factories has the potential to create manufacturing intelligence, of which predictive maintenance is an expression. Hence the need to design new approaches able to manage not only the data volume, but also the variety and velocity, extracting actual value from the humongous amounts of collected data. To this aim, we present iSTEP, an integrated Self-Tuning Engine for Predictive maintenance, based on Big Data technologies and designed for Industry 4.0 applications. The proposed approach targets some of the most common needs of manufacturing enterprises: compatibility with both the on-premises and the in-the-cloud environments, exploitation of reliable and largely supported Big Data platforms, easy deployment through containerized software modules, virtually unlimited horizontal scalability, fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration, flexible yet friendly streaming-KPI computations, and above all, the integrated provisioning of self-tuning machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance. The current implementation of iSTEP exploits a distributed architecture based on Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, MLlib, and Cassandra; iSTEP provides (i) a specific feature engineering block aimed at automatically extracting metrics from the production monitoring time series, which improves the predictive performance by 77% on average, and (ii) a self-tuning approach that dynamically selects the best prediction algorithm, which improves the predictive performance up to 60%. The iSTEP engine provides transparent predictive models, able to provide end users with insights into the knowledge learned, and it has been experimentally evaluated on a public unbalanced failure dataset, whose extensive results are discussed in the paper. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063898878
