With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960269657

The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle. Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis, awareness raising and education and training are important activities to address the challenges of BIM usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881611317

While some of these needs are addressed by several existing FM information systems, building information modeling (BIM), which is becoming widely adopted by the construction industry, holds undeveloped possibilities for providing and supporting FM practices with its functionalities of visualization, analysis, control, and so on. This paper explores how BIM can be a beneficial platform for supplementing FM practices. An online survey and face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess the current status of BIM implementations in FM, potential applications, and the level of interest in the utilization of BIM. Interactions between BIM and FM are defined by illustrating application areas and data requirements for BIM-enabled FM practices. Highlighting the synergy between the two, this paper can help professionals recognize potential areas in which BIM can be useful in FM practices. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859575621

This paper therefore presents a thorough review of published literature on the latest research and standards development that impact upon BIM and its application in facilities management (FM) during the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase of building usage. The purpose is to generate new ideas and provide polemic clarity geared to intellectually challenge readers from across a range of academic and industrial disciplines. The findings reveal that significant challenges facing the FM sector include the need for: greater consideration of long-term strategic aspirations; amelioration of data integration/interoperability issues; augmented knowledge management; enhanced performance measurement; and enriched training and competence development for facilities managers to better deal with the amorphous range of services covered by FM. Future work is also proposed in several key areas and includes: case studies to observe and report upon current practice and development; and supplementary research related to concepts of knowledge capture in relation to FM and the growing use of BIM for asset management. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006802917

The proposed ontological approach can help engineers to find work items with greater ease and consistency. Suggestions are also made for further research on ways of improving the accuracy of BIM-based quantity take-off, and developing a methodology to match between work items which are expressed as different terms; however, the proposed approach emphasizes the automation of searches using BIM data to find items suitable for building elements and materials. To enable automated inference, this study establishes (1) a work condition ontology that consists of the determinants required to select work items, (2) a work item ontology, which consists of the factors defining the tiling method, and (3) semantic reasoning rules. By conducting a case study to demonstrate the proposed ontological inference process in a real-world situation, we confirm that the proposed process can provide consistent results; however, since work items differ depending on construction type and technological advancement, the work item ontology should be continually revised and updated. The ontological inference process removes the need for the intervention of a cost estimator's subjectivity in searching for an appropriate work item. Also, if ontology is elaborately defined by the knowledge of experienced engineers, then accurate and consistent results can be obtained. In addition, the proposed process will assist cost estimators to use BIM data more easily, and it will help the expansion of BIM-based construction management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898014121

However, project delivery methods in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry are often focused on the capital delivery stage and associated costs ranging from planning, through design, to construction and handover. Open data standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and specifications such as the Construction Operations Building information exchange (COBie) provide the capability to capture Facilities Management (FM) data requirements in a structured manner from the early stages of project development. We aim to investigate how and whether IFC and COBie can deliver the data and information about assets required by facility managers within a whole life cycle perspective. We focus on specific use cases including the creation of asset registers and service life planning. However, the methodology adopted can be generalised and applied to any other FM use case. The results show that IFC, COBie and the tested supporting tools exhibited some shortcomings in delivering some of the data entities, types and parameters required for the selected FM use cases. We discuss these shortcomings and propose them as areas for improvement to domain researchers, standardisation bodies and technology providers. Finally, we instigate domain researchers to adopt the proposed methodology and conduct further FM use cases. © 2015 The author.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979562033

While BIM adoption is growing, it can be witnessed that adoption is relatively weak within operational and maintenance (O&M) organisations such as Estate and Infrastructure Management, who would ultimately gain the highest value from utilising BIM. While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems. There is a clear gap of knowledge on how to structure a BIM model that allows its efficient use in the O&M phase. Furthermore, there is a lack of claritiy on how to exchange information from a BIM model into an Asset Information Model (AIM). This paper outlines a methodology that enables extraction of BIM-related data directly from a model into a relational database for integration with existing asset management systems. The paper describes the BIM model requirements, development of the extraction platform, database architecture and framework. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. The case study demonstrates that if the BIM model is designed from the start with consideration for the O&M requirements, it can be exploited for development into an AIM. It also shows that a structured approach to object classification within a BIM model supports the efficient exchange of data directly from the BIM model. © 2019 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070275875

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

The application of KM in construction is fairly researched and reported. Although Building Information Modeling (BIM) is gaining wide acceptance among Architects and Project Managers for efficient and effective design and construction management, the adoption of BIM in operations during post-construction phase such as Facilities Management (FM) is in its normative stage. As FM is knowledge and information intensive and relies heavily on historical information, a Knowledge-based BIM (K-BIM) that is developed on the basis of asconstructed information of the facility has the capability for effective and efficient FM and thereby enhance the competitive advantage of a FM organisation. Ontologies have the potential to represent the body of knowledge of the various domains involved such as KM, FM and BIM. Integration of KM, FM and BIM can also be achieved through ontologies. The proposed conceptual framework, K-BIM is an attempt to advance BIM by way of integrating KM, FM and BIM using ontologies, rather than building a system on a model built using BIM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912544609

Despite this, organisations struggle to view assets within the context of whole-life management and ultimately struggle to harness their full potential value. A recurring theme is the challenges in capturing, storing and validating data across a diverse and complex asset portfolio. The primary reason for this is the fundamental lack of understanding of what information should be collected to support the efficient management of assets throughout their life. Asset-related information that is not collected in alignment to the organisational requirements will restrict the performance of capital investment decisions, risk management and operational performance throughout the whole life of the asset portfolio and ultimately have an impact on productivity. This paper presents a top-down methodology that utilises Building Information Modelling to support the development of Asset Information Requirements. The novel aspect of this approach is the development of Functional Information Requirements to bridge the gap between organisational requirements and Asset Information Requirements. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063992240
