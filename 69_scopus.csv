Particularly, more realistic virtual models of manufactured products are essential to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing and to mirror the real and virtual worlds. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive reference model based on the concept of Skin Model Shapes, which serves as a digital twin of the physical product in design and manufacturing. In this regard, model conceptualization, representation, and implementation as well as applications along the product life-cycle are addressed. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018723536

BIM can be utilized as a less expensive, virtual, and computational environment to enable designers to ponder different design options, or contractors to evaluate different construction schemes, both with a view to minimizing construction waste generation. However, existing debate on this topic too frequently treats BIM as a cure-all silver bullet; without some major hurdles being adequately addressed, the applications of BIM will remain rhetorical. This paper aims to demystify BIM's computational application to CWM. Based on a critical literature review, a prototypical framework of a computational BIM for CWM is delineated, within which the two key prerequisites of ‘information readiness’ and ‘computational algorithms’ are highlighted. Then, the paper details the required information and how it can be organized in a standalone database or encapsulated in existing BIM for CWM. Learning from the historical development of data infrastructure in the field of BIM-based cost management, the process to develop the required information is likely to be tortuous but is unavoidable. The paper further explores computational BIM algorithms that can manipulate the information to facilitate decision-making for CWM. Finally, the operation of computational BIM is elaborated by relating it to various prevailing procurement models within which BIM applications are contextualized. Although the framework reported here has been substantially developed for experimental application, it is not to be taken as an immediately applicable solution but rather as an illustration of the kind of platform on which future development of computational BIM for CWM can proceed in a more efficient and effective fashion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993990049

Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As Building Information Modeling (BIM) becomes more and more mature, a suitable digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated language. However, AEC domain experts usually do not have the required programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL), which uses a graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine- and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and functionalities of the VCCL in detail and shows its application in a number of case studies.

Hence, effective disaster prevention and rescue are crucial to the protection of life and property. Specifically, firefighting is essential for public safety and building safety. Rescue maps that are currently used in fire departments are two-dimensional (2D) because fire accidents have mostly occurred in low-rise buildings. Therefore, fire incident commanders have previously only had typical fire rescue maps to use for firefighter deployment. Such 2D-based firefighting strategies, tactics, and deployment are not always effective in current structures, and do not inform whether occupants are trapped during a fire. Consequently, fire rescue teams continue to consult maps on different floors when conducting fire rescue tasks, reducing their speed and efficiency. An intelligent integrated fire rescue system could provide real-time status updates, alarm reports, and evacuation guidance, improving fire rescue techniques through a combination of contemporary autosensing and communication systems. To achieve the aim, this work combines existing firefighting equipment, Bluetooth sensors, global positioning information, an optimal fire rescue path-planning algorithm, and visual technology to construct a framework of dynamic rescue/evacuation procedures for fire departments. By providing the locations of firefighters and trapped occupants, real-time updates for optimal path planning in a dynamic environment provide fire departments with accurate and useful information regarding the fire site in real time. The proposed system effectively reduces the number of casualties, supporting rescue process and emergency evacuation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057725351

This paper presents a research activity, which has aimed at investigating potentials and criticisms of Parametric and Generative Design techniques in mass-production environments of the BI though a pilot-case-study analysis in Glued-Laminated-Timber (GLT) industry. Starting from programming a parametric algorithm for GLT engineering, the research has measured manufacturing effectiveness and manufacturing efficiency through a Value-Stream Map of an ordinary supply-chain system of GLT. Considering all the limits of referring to a single case study, results highlight improvements both in manufacturing effectiveness and manufacturing efficiency; but limitations have to be considered as well, due to the complete absence of Industry 4.0 approaches and technologies in an ordinary supply-chain system of GLT. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045711724

Often, 2nd-level space boundary data contained in IFC, are missing or incorrect. To facilitate the connection between BIMs and energy simulation programs, the Common Boundary Intersection Projection (CBIP) algorithm is introduced. CBIP uses the geometric representations of building entities obtained from IFC files to generate the building's 2nd-level space boundary topology. A prototypical implementation of the CBIP algorithm is used in a complex geometry building, as a verification of the capability of the algorithm to properly identify space boundaries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446635

The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045552779

It is of crucial importance in project scheduling to ensure the effective use of scarce and expensive renewable resources, and has been successfully applied to production environments, such as make-to-order and engineering-to-order systems. In real-life projects, general temporal relationships are often needed to model complex time-dependencies among activities. We develop a novel genetic algorithm (GA) for the resource levelling problem with generalised precedence relations. Our design and implementation of GA features an efficient schedule generation scheme, built upon a new encoding mechanism that combines the random key representation and the shift vector representation. A two-pass local search-based improvement procedure is devised and integrated into the GA to enhance the algorithmic performance. Our GA is able to obtain near optimal solutions with less than 2% optimality gap for small instances in fractions of a second. It outperforms or is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms for large benchmark instances with size up to 1000 activities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026414847

This is surprising since the field of visual languages has been a vibrant research area for over three decades now. Disagreement about fundamental definitions can undermine a field, fragment the research community, and potentially harm the research progress. To address this issue we have analyzed two decades of VL/HCC publications to clarify the concept of “visual language” as accepted by the VL/HCC community, effectively adopting the approach of descriptive linguistics. As a result we have obtained a succinct visual language ontology, which captures the essential aspects of visual languages and which can be used to characterize individual languages through visual language profiles. These profiles can tell whether and in what sense a notation can be considered a visual language. We also report trends from and statistics about the field of visual languages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018274752

The failure of constructed elements to fall withinthe specified tolerances may be the result of an unsatisfactory level of precision applied duringconstruction or the inability to interpret the information provided in the specifications correctly. Theconsequences of improper dimensional quality control measures have adverse effects on the aestheticsof the elements, and, in severe cases, the structural strength of the elements. The dimensional qualitycontrol practices that are prevalent in today’s industry do not only provide room for random errorsassociated with manual measurements, but also exploit two of the most valuable assets of a constructionproject: time and labor. Nevertheless, if appropriate steps are taken during the design phase, the majorityof these tolerance issues during the construction phase can be prevented. Therefore, this study focuseson the tolerance issues arising during the construction phase by combining design BIM and tolerancespecifications within the same database. A text-parsing algorithm in MATLAB environment was usedto tag elements in an IFC Building Information Model (BIM) with textual-tolerance information. Theoutput IFC BIM including textual-tolerance information would be used by project engineers andinspectors during the construction phase. This would enable access to all tolerance-compliance-relatedinformation within the same database, which would help make timely decisions to prevent rework andschedule delays. © 2017 WIT Press.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031295114
