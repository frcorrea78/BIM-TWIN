The RFID tags support a large set of unique IDs than bar codes and can incorporate additional data such as, manufacturer, product type, and even measure environmental factors such as temperatures. These devices are mainly classified into two main categories such as, the active and the passive. The active tags require a power source and are either connected to a powered infrastructure or use energy stored in an integrated battery and the passive device's lifetime is limited by the stored energy, balanced against the number of read operations the device must undergo.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-32844471136

Despite its potential benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive systematic literature review and case study research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model. Additionally, we provide recommendations for further research within a research agenda. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992398667

As a result, control information is expensive to produce, or is generated irregularly. Additionally, the information is only available infrequently - in many cases after the controlled activity was completed - and its quality and integrity are low. The purpose of the research presented in this paper is to improve monitoring and control information, i.e. to offer it on a daily basis, to improve its quality and integrity and to reduce the cost of generating it. To do all this, the Technion APPC researchers started exploring the use of automated data collection (ADC) technologies. We developed models for automated labor and equipment control, materials management and control as well as monitoring safety measures - all described in this paper. Based on the above, the paper discusses development issues and the prospects for commercializing such systems. Materials management and control is currently the most practical application. On the other end of the spectrum is labor control, which currently is the most challenging area. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845966046

Automated data collection technologies, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), are promising technologies that can be used to efficiently track components in construction supply chains. However, it is still not clear how the cost of technology investment should be shared among supply chain members. This study proposes the use of a cost sharing ratio, which is calculated for each party based on the benefits received. A case study was conducted at a prefabricated exterior concrete wall panel supply chain, and a simulation based decision-support tool was used to model the current manual phase and automated phases. The simulation results were used to determine and analyze the benefits and related cost savings of RFID for each party, and a cost sharing ratio was calculated for distributing the technology investment cost among parties. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860292786

This demands that construction professionals be more effective and organized to successfully complete their construction activities. However, recent research shows that current construction management techniques are ineffective. In addition, this research recognized the potential benefits of location awareness of construction resources in the construction management. The availability of location awareness information was identified to assist real-time decision making, provide more control over construction processes, and improve productivity and safety. In this context, this paper introduces an indoor location tracking system that integrates Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors and motion sensors with BIM. BLE Beacons were used to track a target by estimating its location. Motion sensors were used to enhance the quality of estimation. In addition, a BIM model was exploited to extract map knowledge for movement constraints. Two field tests were conducted at two indoor construction sites. Complex tracking scenarios were designed to thoroughly assess accuracy and reliability of the tracking system. The results demonstrated the capability of the proposed tracking system with an average accuracy of about 1~2 m, which indicated that the implementation of the BLE tracking system in construction applications would be effective and promising for potential widespread adoption. © ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976343009

These enable the movement of components to be tracked on the construction site. However, there is inadequate support for bidirectional coordination between these components and their virtual representations. Also, these approaches often involve manual input of status information into the tags and do not support tracking the permanent installed position of tagged components for consistency maintenance between the as-built and the as-planned models. As such, there are difficulties with ensuring accurate and timely updating of building information models and tag information during the construction process. A major bottleneck in achieving this integration is the choice of appropriate mechanisms for binding physical components with their virtual representations. This paper presents an approach to facilitating bidirectional coordination between physical construction components and their virtual models. Specialized real-time location sensing (RTLS) tags were used for tracking the position and status of physical construction components. This approach showed significant opportunities for enhancing real-time construction consistency checking, which will aid proactive decision making and control. The paper also discusses experiments undertaken to demonstrate the proposed RTLS-based system and highlights the merits and demerits of adopting the proposed approach on a full-scale project. © 2012 Abiola A.

The integrated use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies can enable tracking and improve construction site-related processes. Specifically, there is a lack of studies regarding the tracking of metallic formworks during the execution phase of the cast in place concrete wall constructive system, in which quality issues often imply rework and delays. The main objective of this paper is to design a conceptual framework for tracking physical resources at construction sites using BIM, IoT, and RFID, in which the metallic formworks are the object of study. This study is based on a Systematic Literature Review, which was conducted to identify requirements to connect the concepts and technologies in the conceptual framework and to develop an integrated system that uses the aforementioned technologies. Moreover, a preliminary proposal of an integrated system associating the RFID tags with the ID of equivalent virtual elements in BIM and storing information from the formworks in a database, which communicates with the virtual model, was presented. The conceptual framework and the preliminary proposal will be used for the design of the system prototype for future implementation in real construction environments. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088431633
