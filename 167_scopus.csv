During this transformation, a multi-disciplinary knowledge base, created from studies and research about the built environment aspects is fundamental: historical, architectural, archeologically, environmental, social, economic, etc., and critical. Although there are a growing number of applications of 3D VR modelling applications, some built environment applications such as disaster management, environmental simulations, computer-aided architectural design and planning require more sophisticated models beyond 3D graphical visualization such as multifunctional, interoperable, intelligent, and multi-representational. Advanced digital mapping technologies such as 3D laser scanner technologies can be enablers for effective e-planning, consultation and communication of users' views during the planning, design, construction and lifecycle process of the built environment. These technologies can be used to drive the productivity gains by promoting a free-flow of information between departments, divisions, offices, and sites; and between themselves, their contractors and partners when the data captured via those technologies are processed and modelled into building information modelling (BIM). The use of these technologies is a key enabler to the creation of new approaches to the ""Whole Life Cycle"" process within the built and human environment for the twenty-first century. This paper aims to look at this subject. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the research towards BIM for existing structures via the point cloud data captured by the 3D laser scanner technology. A case study building is used to demonstrate how to produce 3D CAD models and BIM models of existing structures based on designated techniques. Findings - The paper finds that BIM can be achieved for existing structures by modelling the data captured with 3D laser scanner from the existing world. This can be accomplished by adapting appropriate automated data processing and pattern recognition techniques through applied science research. Practical implications - BMI will enable automated and fast data capture and modelling for not only in design and planning, building refurbishment, effective heritage documentation and VR modelling but also disaster management, environmental analysis, assessment and monitoring, GIS implementation, sophisticated simulation environments for different purposes such as climate change, regeneration simulation for complexity and uncertainty and so on. As a result, it will increase the capability for fast production of virtual reality models and comprehensive and sophisticated simulation platforms. Originality/value - The paper provides useful information on BMI for existing structures.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949107149

Although some researchers have promoted the use of BIM in infrastructures and several reviews in BIM implementation have been conducted; the comparative study of BIM implementation between building and infrastructure industry in a holistic view has not been identified. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the extent to which level of BIM implementation has achieved in building and infrastructure industries. This exploration was performed differently from two main sources, namely, academic studies and industrial cases, where conventional reviews in BIM were mainly focused on academic publications only. More than forty case studies in academic journals and conference proceedings and twenty four BIM cases in industrial reports were collected and analysed to determine the current BIM uses and emerging BIM applications in both industries. The results show that (1) BIM case studies in academic journals show the high level of BIM implementation in practice; (2) the initial development of BIM in infrastructure can be referred to the existing BIM experience from the building industry; and (3) the comparative analysis of BIM in infrastructure and building cases highlights the support of new BIM use, enhanced of traditional project management and transformation of project delivery method. © 2014, CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926276952

Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4.0.
