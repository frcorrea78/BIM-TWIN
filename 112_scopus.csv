VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a re-assessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998890667

This approach, known as Building Information Modelling (BIM), is anticipated to become the primary means of information exchange between the various parties involved in construction projects. From a technical perspective, the domain represents an interesting study in model-based interoperability, since the models are large and complex, and the industry is one in which collaboration is a vital part of business. In this paper, we present our experiences with issues of model-based interoperability in exchanging building information models between various tools, and in implementing tools which consume BIM models, particularly using the industry standard IFC data modelling format. We report on the successes and challenges in these endeavours, as the industry endeavours to move further towards fully digitised information exchange. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856211831

The paper uses historical evidence to categorise the principal changes in governance (covering the control, structure and process of systems) in the industrial epoch, which are seen as the successive predominance of markets, (corporate) hierarchies and then networks. These correspond to the successive importance of labour processes, capital processes and information processes. There appears to be a link with the three 'industrial revolutions' that have arisen at century-long intervals since the later 18th century, though the causal interrelationships remain uncertain and by no means necessary. Network alignment is suggested as a means for bringing about the coevolution of governance and technology in development processes. A number of mechanisms for matching technological with organisational change are suggested by the governance literature, although no one theory of governance appears able to explain the observed historical phenomena. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142135940

In order to prevent reoccurrence of defects, a data feedback mechanism is required. However, most defect data are stored in unstructured ways, resulting in the fundamental problem of data utilization. This paper proposes a novel framework by using BIM and linked data technologies for sharing defect data between heterogeneous data sources in a new way. To demonstrate, a defect ontology is developed, work context information is extracted from BIM models, extracted BIM data is converted to RDF format, and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach could help BIM software applications to take into account information stemming from the defect management domain. Also, it can reduce data search time and improve the accuracy of search results as well. Therefore, this framework may enable reductions of defect occurrence and improvements in current defect management practices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013855226

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 246 professionals. The structural equation modeling technique was applied to analyze the data. Findings: The results showed that: team diversity was positively associated with project performance; the introduction of conflicts significantly weakened the effect of diversity on performance; conflicts have both constructive and destructive effects on project performance; and team diversity affected project performance through the mediating effects of task conflict and relationship conflict, thus adding both positive and negative effects on performance. Research limitations/implications: There are other factors which may affect conflicts and project performance such as communication, trust and contract. Future research could be conducted to determine the role of these variables in determining the effects of team diversity on performance. Practical implications: It is necessary to reduce the relationship conflict whereas maintaining a “healthy” level of task conflict. In light of this, the conclusions of this study highlight practical implications as follows: project teams should attach importance to diverse partner selection and select cooperative partners whose value orientations are similar; when implementing a construction project, the structure of diverse project teams should keep relatively stable, avoiding too many teams entering or exiting the project in a short period; project teams should make greater efforts to deal with destructive conflicts via relational governance such as trust and communication. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in three areas. First, this study investigated the dynamic mechanism between team diversity, conflicts and performance in construction projects. Second, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on validating the mediating effects of conflicts on the relationship between team diversity and performance. Third, this study validated the positive and negative effects of team diversity on performance with different types of conflicts as mediation variables in construction projects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062469095

Researchers and practitioners alike argue using Building Information Modeling (BIM) should lead to tighter collaboration and closer communication among project participants working in cross-organizational environments. Using data from observations over fifteen months of the integrated design process of a laboratory building project, we build a typology of the strategies of successful collaboration within the AEC industry. Then, using interview data from 70 architects, engineers and general contractors from across the U.S., we test our proposed typology to suggest how the collaboration process is implicated in inter-organizational BIM integration. We find that inter-organizational BIM-enabled projects and successful interorganizational collaboration have shared theoretical categories: fostering integrated teams; implementing tools and strategies to encourage clear communication across the team; and developing transparent technology use. We argue that attempts at either will not be successful without first establishing the right social and organizational foundation that supports both collaboration and successful technology implementation.

There are many views how to observe benefits of BIM in construction industry. It is clear that project management and optimization of management processes in construction projects is big challenge nowadays. The purpose of paper is to enhance efficiency of construction management practices. Paper follows up previous papers of authors that were focused on crucial points of construction management from view of structure and hierarchy of construction projects. There were defined crucial points in exchanging information and their insufficiency for concrete participant of construction project. This paper is focused on standardized environment for exchanging information in BIM. Generally, it is called Common Data Environment (further CDE). The paper observes influence of CDE on efficiency of construction projects and options of implementation into real projects. From practical experience of authors in project management in construction business were proposed possibilities of implementation to road projects in Czech Republic from view of feasibility. For several possible types of implementation of CDE (proposed by authors) were evaluated impacts on feasibility of construction projects primarily cost and benefits of implementation. From this evaluation were find out the most appropriate types of implementation for CDE and practical proposal of strategies of implementation of CDE into construction projects of multiple types of construction projects. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062445962

In other knowledge fields, such as information systems (IS) and military research, the interoperability construct has evolved beyond the purely technological domain to encompass multiple dimensions. Within the AEC industry, these dimensions of interoperability have yet to take root. This paper introduces a conceptual framework that develops the interoperability construct across multiple dimensions. The framework defines emerging collaborative project delivery systems within the AEC industry by relating the technological, organization and procedural dimensions and situating them within the contextual dimension. The framework is underpinned by an information processing systems approach to project delivery in the AEC industry. Based on a two-part systematic literature review, a rigorous and structured process aimed at answering a very specific and targeted question within a given field, this paper presents the conceptual framework and discusses the various dimensions of interoperability. The paper concludes by presenting opportunities for future research through gaps identified in the literature. It is believed that by adopting this broader view of the interoperability construct in the AEC industry, the deployment of seamless collaborative project delivery systems and emerging technologies and processes, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) will be better informed and structured and thus more effective and efficient. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904693189

When tackling the importance of interoperability in BIM, overviewing challenges and listing existing solutions is an important step. This work highlights the need of interoperability in BIM. A review of the state of art on encountered interoperability challenges in BIM also helps to enumerate existing solutions.

Digital transformation is not exclusively about digital technology but the fact that technology, which is digital, will enable the organisation to create greater informed decisions around there current and future challenges, objectives and strategy. While many organisations are currently going through a digital transformation process, there are challenges in demonstrating the value of such a transformation process to the broader organisation. This is partly due to the fact that for digital transformation to be successful it must encompass all of the organisation, including traditional business processes and functions that are not prone to change. Furthermore, it can be witnessed that digital transformation is not purely a technical solution but is also an organisational cultural change, one that allows for an agile approach to working and one that acknowledges failure in a positive perspective. A framework is proposed in this paper that utilises the B1M information management processes and adopts them into a digital transformation process. The framework aims to not look at BIM within individual lifecycle stages, but the full adoption of BIM between all the lifecycles stages. Furthermore, it will support the full organisational adoption of BIM within all organisational functions such as risk management, customer reengagement, fiscal management, resource management, ETC. finally, the framework will enable the culture to change requirements by providing a collaborative and transparent environment to digital transformation. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091024121
