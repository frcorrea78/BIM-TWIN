This article reviews literature on this 'performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, its adoption remains a challenge for the AECO industry because it requires a shift to a new way of working, leading to a current discrepancy in the adoption of BIM in the EU. The paper aims at assessing the gaps in the BIM adoption between the 28 EU countries and the barriers related to its implementation. The methodology adopted here is twofold: first, secondary data are given by a systematic literature review, completed with the review of current projects funded by the European Commission, and dealing with fostering the BIM adoption. Second, primary data are provided by a questionnaire survey to classify BIM initiatives regarding policies, the level of adoption and the barriers encountered in the 28 EU countries. In order to grade the heterogeneity of BIM adoption in the EU, we have classified the countries into four categories with different levels of awareness, from early adopters (BIM already mandated)to countries without any plan. The survey has enabled the analysis of twenty barriers to BIM adoption using the four grades in relation to the respondent country. We found barriers that are acknowledged by all countries irrespective of their level of BIM adoption. Other barriers have been already tackled by the early adopters but not by the newcomers who have yet to experience some of these issues. Finally, the assessment of the disparities of BIM adoption within the EU can help the European Commission towards unifying European standard on BIM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065148693

This study demonstrates, through investigations of small samples of dwellings, that the level of quality, and outputs, from a standardised energy assessment can be variable. Multiple assessors evaluating the same property can produce quite markedly different results and, therefore, recommendations for what that household should do to reduce their energy consumption. Using the results of studies conducted by the authors and from elsewhere, qualified commentary is provided relating to what this form of energy assessment should be used for, and whether improvements can be made in the future as areas of policy look to reflect the recorded energy performance of dwellings through a range of policy vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025159914
