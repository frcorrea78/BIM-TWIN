In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049913864

Today, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a well-established technology among the available non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for the collection of ground-based information. Concurrently, the space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is another well-known viable methodology for large-scale investigations of road network surface deformations.

In order to overcome these limitations, this study proposes a structural safety diagnosis method using laser scanning and BIM. In spite of the various studies related to laser scanning and BIM, it is difficult to find a study that verifies the effect of shortening the service period and cost reduction in terms of project management. Therefore, in this study, case analysis of structural safety diagnosis of large-scale civil infrastructure was conducted. In the structural safety diagnosis, the laser scanning data and the BIM model were compared and analyzed to determine the degree of deformation of pipe rack (e.g., truss, column). Laser scanning data reflects the deformation state of large-scale civil infrastructure. On the other hand, the BIM model was constructed by reflecting the state before the transformation with reference to the laser scanning data. Finally, proposed method of structural safety diagnosis saved four months. In terms of manpower saving, 125 man-month was saved. The research findings can provide a quantitative basis for the introduction of laser scanning and BIM technology in the structural safety diagnosis of aging large-scale civil infrastructures. However, the limitations of this study have not been analyzed economically by considering the investment cost (e.g., hardware, software, training, etc.) of laser scanning and BIM technology and the cost saving effect of technology introduction. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055965966

The major aim of this study is to underline the potential of an interoperable and shared model supplemented by GIS data, in minimizing or definitely removing the possible conflicts that typically arise between the infrastructure design and environmental constraints.

The relevant information, regarding surface distresses too, is thus available in economical, high-speed and high-resolution forms, with limited disturbance on traffic and road agencies issues. However, the availability of such a mass of data poses interesting questions concerning the most efficient processing and analysis methods, for optimizing maintenance operation planning. Unfortunately, the PMS adoption is not very common and widespread, as they are significantly complicated and sophisticated, with critical consequences in their actual and intense practical use. Then, there is a need of simplifying the pavement maintenance process, by defining smart tools actually supporting the operators in the analysis and decisional phases. BIM (Building Information Modeling) procedures can absolutely represent a strategical solution. Indeed, BIM models, already widely adopted in the structural fields, have been recently introduced in the infrastructural design phases, simplifying the entire life-cycle of the construction, with representation clarity, mistake reduction, and money savings. However, although the BIM advantages have been significantly exploited in the design phases, pavement maintenance has not been directly involved in the BIM processes. Then, this paper focuses on a methodological analysis of the problem, aiming to propose a novel BIM-based approach for managing pavement maintenance. The goal is to define proper “smart objects”, based on specific relational databases, that may represent a more suitable instrument for handling pavement condition and quality information, in a user-friendly software environment.

As a test to the proposed methodology, an experimental activity was conducted over a real highway infrastructure, that was parallelly inspected by GPR, MLS and InSAR. To the purpose of the study, the raw dataset from the three surveys were separately processed, scaled and converted into suitable file formats to be more rapidly implemented into the BIM environment. As a result, the synergistic use of geometric and design information with the results from monitoring activities allowed the definition of a Digital Twin Model of the investigated road infrastructure, which can be progressively updated at each new survey, thereby permitting to detect pavement distresses and to control their evolution over time, while being aware of the effect of any delay in maintenance activities. Preliminary results have shown promising viability of the data management model for supporting asset managers in the various management phases, thereby proving this methodology to be worthy for implementation in Pavement Management Systems (PMS) © COPYRIGHT SPIE.
