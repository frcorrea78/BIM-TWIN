It has the ability of detecting small changes in some chosen system parameters. In the residual function, the left null space of the observability matrix associated to a reference model is confronted to the Hankel matrix of output covariances estimated from test data. When this left null space is not perfectly known from a model, it should be replaced by an estimate from data to avoid model errors in the residual computation. In this paper, the asymptotic distribution of the resulting data-driven residual is analyzed and its covariance is estimated, which includes also the covariance related to the reference null space estimate. The importance of including the covariance of the reference null space estimate is shown in a numerical study. © 2018",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054595969

We present an approach, which is based on recent developments in the field of risk-based operation and maintenance planning at the structural system level. The approach utilizes heuristics to define inspection and repair strategies at the system level and to reduce the search space of possible strategies. For each defined strategy, the expected service life cost of inspection, repair and failure is evaluated based on simulated inspection and repair histories. Subset simulation is applied to compute the conditional repair and failure probabilities required for this analysis. It also forms the basis for simulating inspection and repair histories. The strategy that minimizes the expected service life cost is the optimal one in the set of pre-selected strategies. The underlying condition and performance model accounts for the stochastic dependence among the deterioration states of the different structural elements and the structural redundancy. The approach is demonstrated in a case study considering a jacket-type frame. In this study, we essentially vary the inspection interval, the minimum number of inspected components and the target reliability, and identify the combination that minimizes the expected total service life cost. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063971380

This development leads to a rapid expansion of the numbers, as well as the complexity of the performed measurements, so that quality management of measurement data and data management attain practical importance. The data quality can be structured in four criteria, which comprehensive advertency has a significant impact on the value of the derived information. The large amount of data can be handled using an efficiently designed and mostly automated data management, only. The various aspects of data quality and data management have been studied in the research project GIGAWIND life and assessed using the measurement data from the wind park Alpha Ventus.

From a surveying or civil engineer's point of view, vibration-based SHM can be conducted by inspecting the changes in the global dynamic behaviour of a structure, such as natural frequencies (i. e. eigenfrequencies), mode shapes (i. e. eigenforms) and modal damping, which are known as modal parameters. This research work aims to propose a robust and automatic vibration analysis procedure that is so-called robust time domain modal parameter identification (RT-MPI) technique. It is novel in the sense of automatic and reliable identification of initial eigenfrequencies even closely spaced ones as well as robustly and accurately estimating the modal parameters of a bridge structure using low numbers of cost-effective micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers. To estimate amplitude, frequency, phase shift and damping ratio coefficients, an observation model consisting of: (1) a damped harmonic oscillation model, (2) an autoregressive model of coloured measurement noise and (3) a stochastic model in the form of the heavy-tailed family of scaled t-distributions is employed and jointly adjusted by means of a generalised expectation maximisation algorithm. Multiple MEMS as part of a geo-sensor network were mounted at different positions of a bridge structure which is precalculated by means of a finite element model (FEM) analysis. At the end, the estimated eigenfrequencies and eigenforms are compared and validated by the estimated parameters obtained from acceleration measurements of high-end accelerometers of type PCB ICP quartz, velocity measurements from a geophone and the FEM analysis. Additionally, the estimated eigenfrequencies and modal damping are compared with a well-known covariance driven stochastic subspace identification approach, which reveals the superiority of our proposed approach. We performed an experiment in two case studies with simulated data and real applications of a footbridge structure and a synthetic bridge. The results show that MEMS accelerometers are suitable for detecting all occurring eigenfrequencies depending on a sampling frequency specified. Moreover, the vibration analysis procedure demonstrates that amplitudes can be estimated in submillimetre range accuracy, frequencies with an accuracy better than 0.1 Hz and damping ratio coefficients with an accuracy better than 0.1 and 0.2 % for modal and system damping, respectively. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086926742

In the construction industry and especially in the infrastructure sector, these changes are still ongoing and are characterized by complex interactions and data management. Digital methods, in particular Building Information Modeling (BIM) and structural health monitoring (SHM), are increasingly being used. However, building operation and maintenance processes still follow conventional procedures mostly and are only reluctantly supported by digital databases. Within the wide field of different infrastructures, the railway sector specifically consists of rather aged methods and structures, components and devices, which need intense service. Research at Leibniz University Hannover investigates a basic concept for digitally supported maintenance of railway infrastructures, called shBIM, to enhance the reliability and safety of railway networks. The idea of shBIM is to combine strengths of both, Structural Health Monitoring and Building Information Modeling in order to provide a structured, data driven knowledge-base. Necessary methods and processes need to be defined and harmonized for different perspectives like supervisory authorities, infrastructure operators and monitoring service providers.
