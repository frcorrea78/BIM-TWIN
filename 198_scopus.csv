The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle. Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis, awareness raising and education and training are important activities to address the challenges of BIM usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881611317

Reducing consumption is also a sociological, technological and scientific matter. New methods have to be devised in order to support building professionals in their effort to optimize designs and to enhance energy performances. Indeed, the research field related to building modelling and energy performances prediction is very productive, involving various scientific domains. Among them, one can distinguish physics-related fields, focusing on the resolution of equations simulating building thermal behaviour and mathematics-related ones, consisting in the implementation of prediction model thanks to machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a detailed review and discussion of these works. First, the approaches based on physical (white box) models are reviewed according three-category classification. Then, we present the main machine learning (black box) tools used for prediction of energy consumption, heating/cooling demand, indoor temperature. Eventually, a third approach called hybrid (grey box) method is introduced, which uses both physical and statistical techniques.

Using data from over 12 months of ethnographic observations of the MEP coordination process for two commercial construction projects and interviews with 65 industry leaders across the United States, we find that BIM-enabled projects are often tightly coupled technologically, but divided organizationally. This means that while BIM makes visible the connections among project members, it is not fostering closer collaboration across different companies. We outline the competing obligations to scope, project, and company as one cause for this division. Obligations to an individual scope of work or to a particular company can conflict with project goals. Individual leadership, especially that of the MEP coordinator in the teams we studied, often substitutes for stronger project cohesion and organization.

This article argues for scholars to bridge the conversations that seek to critique data science and those that seek to advance data science practice to identify and create the social and organizational arrangements necessary for a more ethical data science. We summarize four critiques that are commonly made in critical data studies: data are inherently interpretive, data are inextricable from context, data are mediated through the sociomaterial arrangements that produce them, and data serve as a medium for the negotiation and communication of values. We present qualitative research with academic data scientists, ""data for good"" projects, and specialized cross-disciplinary engineering teams to show evidence of these critiques in the day-to-day experience of data scientists as they acknowledge and grapple with the complexities of their work. Using ethnographic vignettes from two large multiresearcher field sites, we develop a set of concepts for analyzing and advancing the practice of data science and improving critical data studies, including (1) communication is central to the data science endeavor; (2) making sense of data is a collective process; (3) data are starting, not end points, and (4) data are sets of stories. We conclude with two calls to action for researchers and practitioners in data science and critical data studies alike. First, creating opportunities for bringing social scientific and humanistic expertise into data science practice simultaneously will advance both data science and critical data studies. Second, practitioners should leverage the insights from critical data studies to build new kinds of organizational arrangements, which we argue will help advance a more ethical data science. Engaging the insights of critical data studies will improve data science. Careful attention to the practices of data science will improve scholarly critiques.

Our study suggests that deeply embedded disciplinary thinking is not easily overcome by digital representations of knowledge and that collaboration may be hindered through the exposure of previously implicit distinctions among the team members' skills and organizational status.

Whereas, many global business models feature significant elements of renting, leasing and hiring and focus only on resource management, sometimes at the expense of community growth. The service we discuss is based in the area we studied and has a collective model of sharing, but hopes to be part of the new global movement. We use this hybridity to problematize issues of culture, place and scalability in developing sharing resources and addressing sustainability concerns. We relate this to the motivation, rhetoric and design choices of other local sharing enterprises and other global sharing economy initiatives, arguing, in conclusion, that there is no sharing economy, but a variety of new cultures being fostered.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955589430

Second, looking at distributed teams, whose interaction is mediated by technology, the authors argue that virtual world visualizations enhance discovery, while distributed AEC teams also need more traditional forms of 2D abstraction, sketching and gestures to support integrated design dialogue. Finally, in information exchange research, the authors found that models and data have their own logic and structure and, as such, require creativity and ingenuity to exchange data across systems. Taken together, these streams of research suggest that process innovation is brought about by people developing new practices. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors argue that technology alone does not change practice. People who modify practices with and through technology create process innovation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062278433

It has been heralded as a 'digital revolution' and it is expected to improve collaboration, productivity, and product quality throughout the building life cycle by providing 'perfect information' on which to base the design and construction (Crotty 2012). However, little is known about the use of BIM in practice, and it has so far not been studied from a CSCW perspective. In this paper we present preliminary findings from a field study of a large hospital construction project in Denmark. The project is in its early phases, so the focus is on the role of BIM as a platform for collaboration among client, architects, engineers and future users regarding the conceptual design. Our findings suggest that recurrent reviews of the evolving digital model played a key role in the collaboration. We identified three kinds of design reviews: clash detection, scenario-based reviews and embodied reviews - each focusing on specific aspects of the conceptual design. © ECSCW 2017 - Proceedings of the 15th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work.

Concretely, we design and implement an immersive Cooperative Work Environment in Virtual Reality using real-life 3D architectural models of a hospital. We then invite healthcare practitioners to cooperatively resuscitate patients experiencing cardiac arrest in an immersive Cooperative Work Environment. This enabled the healthcare practitioners to identify critical functional errors (e.g. how asymmetric door design compromised resurrection practices in certain situations) that were not detected through other available architectural representations. Based upon our research, we identify three design dimensions essential to creating immersive Cooperative Work Environments: 1) the cooperative dimension, structured as the design of interdependence, articulation work, awareness, and grounding; 2) the professional work dimension, structured as the design of work practices, policies, artefacts, and professional language; and 3) the spatiotemporal dimension, structured as the design of loci and mobility. We also identified temporal orientation as a cross-spanning category relevant for all three design dimensions essential to participants’ navigating of the building. Temporal orientation in an immersive Cooperative Work Environment must accommodate the experience of sequential time, clock time, and action time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102851556

Smart city and modernization projects are just some examples of such transformations. This paper focuses on struggles over the acquisition, control, and maintenance of these public, digital infrastructures. We focus on the forms of HCI knowledge and practice that proved useful to a coalition of community organizations claiming rights of input into and political oversight over surveillance technology. Their claims were a response to their exclusion from decision-making about smart city implementation in San Diego. We ofer tactics from below as a way to attune HCI to the needs and practices of those excluded from power over widespread technology infrastructures. Ultimately, we argue that HCI cultivates a variety of capacities beyond design and redesign that can strengthen struggles to shape real-world technologies from below. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106695346

This paper's aim is to make a two-fold contribution. On one hand, it describes the design framework as a support tool for practitioners in their exploration of sound-informed geometries through 3D modelling and digital fabrication. On the other hand, it informs educators on key aspects for combining sound, 3D modelling, and digital fabrication within educational curricula and in their students' design processes. The framework was tested during a workshop where participants produced and fabricated 3D objects informed by sound patterns they created. After describing the design process, the final installation and its shape grammars, as well as participant experiences during the design process, the paper concludes with a discussion on how the design framework can be useful for practitioners and educators. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101738414
