Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

Secondly, the main available methods which are actually used for study masonry historical structures are referred to and discussed. The main available strategies, including limit analysis, simplified methods, FEM macro- or micro-modeling and discrete element methods (DEM) are considered with regard to their realism, computer efficiency, data availability and real applicability to large structures. A set of final considerations are offered on the real possibility of carrying out realistic analysis of complex historic masonry structures. In spite of the modern developments, the study of historical buildings is still facing significant difficulties linked to computational effort, possibility of input data acquisition and limited realism of methods. © 2010 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955569570

These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the ""as-is"" conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large, highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873283130

The most important decisions regarding a building's sustainable features are made during the design and preconstruction stages. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) is the most widely adopted sustainable building rating system in the United States. For projects pursuing LEED® certification, designers have to conduct in-depth sustainability analyses based on a building's form, materials, context, and mechanical-electrical-plumbing (MEP) systems. Since Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one model, it creates an opportunity to conduct these analyses accurately and efficiently as compared to the traditional methods. In this exploratory research, a case study was conducted on Salisbury University's Perdue School of Business building to demonstrate the use of BIM for sustainable design and the LEED® certification process. First, a conceptual framework was developed to establish the relationship between BIM-based sustainability analyses and the LEED ® certification process. Next, the framework was validated via this case study. The results of this study indicate that documentation supporting LEED® credits may be directly or indirectly prepared using the results of BIM-based sustainability analyses software. This process could streamline the LEED® certification process and save substantial time and resources which would otherwise be required using traditional methods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551681843

The next stage involves the design and construction of a parametric library of objects, which are based on the manuscripts ranging from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books. In building parametric objects, the problem of file format and exchange of data has been overcome within the BIM ArchiCAD software platform by using geometric descriptive language (GDL).

Despite the significant impact of information and communications technology (ICT) on architectural heritage, current approaches to its use in this context are often conceived only to provide flexible and reusable tools and methodologies, thus proposing oversimplified procedures that are ultimately insufficient for a truly accurate conservation project. A few experiences recently have focused much attention on the specifics of conservation. Although they have generally been concerned with the specific activities and knowledge domains related to conservation processes (such as cataloguing or monument damage), the importance of dealing with them in an integrated way is often neglected. Hence, each step of the process – such as the preliminary phase of knowledge acquisition, the summaries, which facilitate the assessment of value, diagnostics, design, the construction phase, and maintenance – is treated in isolation from all the other activities. This lack of synergy often compromises the final result. In order to deal with the complexity of representing historical architecture, and its conservation process, this proposed model defines four main knowledge domains (artefact – lifecycle – architectural heritage investigation process – actors), in which all the knowledge related to each artefact is formalized through semantic networks, in terms of entities, properties and relationships. Specific reasoning and inference rules allow checking of the model for coherence, in order to reduce information discrepancies, inconsistencies and errors. The proposed model offers a high level of accuracy in its capacity for description and, at the same time, a broad versatility within representation modelling, allowing such a reliable representation of multiple issues that eventually it may be required for every historical building, depending on its features and state of conservation. Moreover, the versatility of the model provides a suitable representation even for the different nature of the investigation activities results – whether analytical or hermeneutical. Finally, the knowledgebase has been connected with a building information modelling environment, providing an effective integration between geometrical and non-geometrical information. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003032387

Part of it is carried out within the INTERREG EU project framework, which aims to the valuation and dissemination of the role of the Church of S. Maria di Scaria (Vall' Intelvi) in the international European exchange of skills in the past centuries. It mainly focuses on the Carloni's intervention (XVIII century), a local family of craftsmen, famous across many European cities and regions for the construction of monuments with rich decorations. In this way they managed to send holy gifts and money, but also offered their skills in order to enrich the church of Scaria as a symbol of their success. The laser scanning and photogrammetric surveys have been carried out with the on-site stratigraphic analysis and with the quest for the scarcely available historical documents, in an attempt to study the reconstruction and the main transformations and chronological phases, from the Romanic to the Baroque interventions and to the more recent ones: An integrated BIM approach has been chosen as an experimental way of transmitting a piece of the history of the church life to the local people and also for touristic purposes. In order to disseminate the information on the transformations of the building and on the various decorations in a way that would facilitate the readability and interpretation of the monument by the visitors, a little local museum, co-funded by the EU Interreg programme, is planned to be realized mainly containing the exhibition of the collections of the sacred vessels and furnishings donated to the church in the past.

Terrestrial laser scanning has been proscribed as the preferred method for rapidly capturing buildings for BIM geometry. This is a process change from a traditional measured building survey just with a total station and is aided by the increasing acceptance of point cloud data being integrated with parametric building models in BIM tools such as Autodesk Revit or Bentley Architecture.

Model calibration refers to correcting the inherent deficiencies within the FE model by matching outputs to measured data. Model calibration has the potential to produce more reliable computer models and thus aid in the economical management and maintenance of contemporary as well as heritage structures. Researchers involved in the assessment of historic masonry monuments have devoted decades of consistent attention to FE model calibration. This paper reviews the recent developments in this topic with a focus on complex vaulted masonry monuments. Studies on simpler forms of masonry structures, such as masonry arch bridges or masonry towers, are also discussed since they lay the groundwork for studies on more complex structures. This paper identifies several remaining technical challenges as model calibration approaches gain wider recognition and usage in historic monument structural assessment.

However, management and conservation represent crucial phases within the life cycle of historical buildings. Unfortunately, the complexity of conservation practices and the lack of knowledge of historic buildings are the cause of an inefficient recovering process in case of emergencies. To overcome this problem, this research aims to ensure the preservation of relevant information through the use of building information modeling (BIM) methodology. By developing historic building information models (HBIMs), it is possible to enhance the architectural heritage. This represents an opportunity to incorporate digital media into the global heritage conservation field. To achieve this goal, a historical castle was selected as a case study; this unique piece of architecture is located in the Piedmont Region, close to city of Turin (Italy). The results show a direct relation between a historical digital model, finalized to the management of architectural and system components, and visualization tools. To conclude, the adoption of this strategy is an effective way to preserve and consult information using advanced visualization techniques based on augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR). © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042152204

Different heritage organisations have showed interest in innovative methods to resolve those problems and improve cultural tourism for sustainable economic development. Building Information Modelling (BIM) has emerged as a suitable computerised system for improving heritage management. Its application to historic buildings is named Historic BIM (HBIM). HBIM literature highlights the need for further research in terms of the overall processes of heritage projects, its practical implementation and a need for better cultural documentation. This work uses Design Science Research to develop a protocol to improve the workflow in heritage interdisciplinary projects. Research techniques used include documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews and focus groups. HBIM is proposed as a virtual model that will hold heritage data and will articulate processes. As a result, a simple and visual HBIM protocol was developed and applied in a real case study. The protocol was named BIMlegacy and it is divided into eight phases: building registration, determine intervention options, develop design for intervention, planning the physical intervention, physical intervention, handover, maintenance and culture dissemination.

The geometric continuity at the intrados makes generally possible the execution all over the span of frescoes, stucco and decorations, with a great diffusion of a great variety of solutions. The construction of brick vaults, from the late Middle Age, was sped up by limiting the centring to the wooden planks arches that were instrumental in the profile determination. Starting from laser scanning, photogrammetric and thermographic techniques, the punctual reconstruction of the geometry and construction techniques allowed to recognise and understand the constructive richness, the multiplicity and unicity of each vaulted element, made of recurrent elements and specific features, thus sketching a mixed pattern of workers and highlighting the constructive knowledge of ‘stereotomy’ applied to the brick block vaults. Nowadays, the availability of several BIM-based modelling procedures and tools based on high detailed surveys allows to identify and reconstruct the shape, drawing reliable assumptions about the construction methods and the execution time. The research methodology here proposed intends to tackle an updatable geographic catalogue, able to transfer the construction richness, inheriting the historic lesson of French ‘repertoires’ to generate modern HBIM vault libraries (abaci). The paper focuses on a well-documented case, the Magio Grasselli palace in Cremona in which the cloister vaults of two main rooms, and others, show different construction systems embodied by the geometry. The methodology has shown how the cloister vault typology can be turned to a dome construction in the same vault, and how ‘stereotomy’, the capacity of skilled workers to control the space, modified the typical geometry, made by the ‘generative’ construction process used for the cloister vault (intended as the intersection of 2 barrel vaults), turning it into a dome in the upper part, giving back a sort of morphing, merging the two different generative rules (dome and vault) as described hereafter and creating unexpected scenic effect. © 2018, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055413272

This combination of 3D digital survey, parametric modelling and monitoring datasets allows for the development of a system for archiving and visualizing structural health monitoring (SHM) data (Fig. 1). The availability of a BIM database allows one to integrate a different kind of data stored in different ways (e.g. reports, tables, graphs, etc.) with a representation directly connected to the 3D model of the structure with appropriate levels of detail (LoD). Data can be interactively accessed by selecting specific objects of the BIM, i.e. connecting the 3D position of the sensors installed with additional digital documentation. Such innovative BIM objects, which form a new BIM family for SHM, can be then reused in other projects, facilitating data archiving and exploitation of data acquired and processed. The application of advanced modeling techniques allows for the reduction of time and costs of the generation process, and support cooperation between different disciplines using a central workspace.

Specifically, this work is part of a broader project, which final aim is to support stakeholders through BIM. Given that humidity is one of the major causes of weathering, being able to detect, depict and forecast it, is a key task. A BIM model of a heritage building - enhanced with the integration of a weathering forecasting model - will be able to give detailed information on possible degradation patterns, and when they will happen. This information can be effectively used to plan both ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. The Jewel Tower in London, our case study, is digitised using combined laser scanning and photogrammetry, and a virtual model is produced. The point cloud derived from combined laser scanning & photogrammetry is traced out in with Autodesk Revit, where the main volumetry (gross walls and floors) is created with parametric objects. Surface characterisation of the façade is given through renderings. Specifically, new rendering materials have been created for this purpose, based on rectified photos of the Tower. The model is then integrated with moisture data, organised in spreadsheets and linked to it via parametric objects representing the points where measurements had been previously taken. The spatial distribution of moisture is then depicted using Dynamo. This simple exercise demonstrates the potential Dynamo has for condition reporting, and future work will concentrate on the creation of a complex forecasting model to be linked through it. © Authors 2018.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers a process of digitally documenting of all the features that are made or incorporated into the building over its life-span, thus affords unique opportunities for information preservation. BIM of historical buildings are called Historical Building Information Models (HBIM). This involves documenting a building in detail throughout its history. Geomatics professionals have the potential to play a major role in this area as they are often the first professionals involved on construction development sites for many Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) projects. In this work, we discuss how to establish an architectural database of a heritage site, digitally reconstruct, preserve and then interact with it through an immersive environment that leverages BIM for exploring historic buildings. The reconstructed heritage site under investigation was constructed in the early 15th century. In our proposed approach, the site selection was based on many factors such as architectural value, size, and accessibility. The 3D model is extracted from the original collected and integrated data (Image-based, range-based, CAD modelling, and land survey methods), after which the elements of the 3D objects are identified by creating a database using the BIM software platform (Autodesk Revit). The use of modern and widely accessible game engine technology (Unity3D) is explored, allowing the user to fully embed and interact with the scene using handheld devices.

Building performance analysis is becoming increasingly important because decision makers can have a better visualization of their building's performance and quickly make the solution for improving building energy efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. Nowadays, building information models (BIMs) have been widely created during the design phase of new buildings, and it can be easily imported to third party software to conduct various analyses. However, a BIM is not always available for all existing buildings. Even if a BIM is available during the design and construction phases, it is very challenging to keep updating it while a building is aged. A manual process to create or update a BIM is very time consuming and labor intensive. A laser scanning technology has been a popular tool to create as-is BIM. However it still needs labor-intensive manual processes to create a BIM out of point clouds. This paper introduces automatic as-is simplified BIM creation from point clouds for energy simulations. A framework of decision support system that can assist decision makers on retrofits for existing buildings is introduced as well.

Insufficient data integration between the tools and Building Information Modeling (BIM) currently prevents the efficient production of comprehensive building performance analyses. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain simulation tool, effective and efficient data, and a process integration methodology are all required. Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) has emerged as a form of object-oriented modeling capable of supporting multiple domain simulations. Adoption of OOPM into building performance simulations with BIM is particularly interesting as a means of facilitating model translations between BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modeling). Specifically, complex data translation from the building topology in BIM to the space boundary conditions in BEM is both labor intensive and time consuming. This research uses case studies to investigate the feasibility of automatically translating a building topology from BIM to OOPM-based BEM.We included numerous preconditions in order to incorporate various object semantic differences into each model translation.

Architectural and structural elements of churches, castles, and historical monuments such as complex vaults, arches, decorations and ornaments, irregular walls with a variable section and wall stratigraphy require higher levels of detail (LOD) and information (LOI) than new buildings. Consequently, the structure of a BIM model oriented to represent heritage buildings (HBIM) required the definition of a new digital process capable of converting the traditional techniques to the generation of 'unique' digital models able to connect different type of information.

Another point of view sees heritage conservation as an already act of sustainable development that protects and preserves social and cultural resources such as heritage buildings and their intangible values. On the other hand, research and practice have proven that heritage buildings can be the subjects of sustainable design projects that achieve outstanding measures of sustainability and energy efficiency while not compromising the authenticity of the heritage value of the building. This sustainable conservation reaches its peak in adaptive-reuse projects of heritage buildings as reusing the building guarantees its ongoing maintenance and promotes its social, cultural and economic values to society, while giving it the ability to withstand modern users’ comfort and energy efficiency standards.

These data can vary from outer geometry survey, to sub-surface materials and structural integrity investigations, to data concerning the building performance, as well as the historic records concerning the building's morphology over time, which can help to create a more in-depth knowledge about the heritage buildings' status and performance and can create a solid base for any required restoration and retrofitting processes. © Authors 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065666005

The buildings are designed and built in a traditional way. The purpose of the research is to evaluate their behaviour, under conditions of regular uses, in order to obtain a diagnostic. Records of temperature, relative humidity and illuminance are taken during 10 day periods of July and December 2008 using HOBO U12 data loggers, along with daily data collection of energy consumptions. Simultaneously, thermal transmittance of envelope elements and global thermal coefficients of heating and cooling are calculated, and compared to the acceptable values stipulated by Argentinean IRAM Standards. Measured energy consumption ratios per unit surface are analyzed; annual values per unit area are contrasted with international EU indexes. Results show a strong incidence of user's habits in the aspects approached, and it also reveal that both apartments reach the minimum range of energy efficiency (150kWh/m2). Referring to architectural-constructive features, the apartment with lower thermal transmittance and minor form factor, presents more stable indoor temperatures. Heat/cool air conditioner systems (Split type) has less energy consumption than fans and stoves but produce greater CO2 emissions.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886780917
