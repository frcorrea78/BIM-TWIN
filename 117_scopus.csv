Integration between sustainability and business development is needed, which the Circular Economy model offers. Circular Economy is little implemented in practice, and in the present paper barriers to a transition to Circular Economy is identified. Barriers are financial, structural, operational, attitudinal and technological. They are also, as analyzed in relation to innovation management, characterized by a need to increase integration between a number of different perspectives and domains in industry. © 2017 The Authors.

But the control of new facilities and the production of their corresponding as-is BIM models requires the identification and inspection of numerous other building components and objects, e.g. MEP components, such as plugs, switches, ducts, and signs. In this paper, we present a new 6D-based (XYZ + RGB) approach that processes dense coloured 3D points provided by terrestrial laser scanners in order to recognize the aforementioned smaller objects that are commonly located on walls. This paper focuses on the recognition of objects such as sockets, switches, signs, extinguishers and others. After segmenting the point clouds corresponding to the walls of a building, a set of candidate objects are detected independently in the colour and geometric spaces, and an original consensus procedure integrates both results in order to infer recognition. Finally, the recognized object is positioned and inserted in the as-is semantically-rich 3D model, or BIM model. The assessment of the method has been carried out in simulated scenarios under virtual scanning providing high recognition rates and precise positioning results. Experimental tests in real indoors using our MoPAD (Mobile Platform for Autonomous Digitization) platform have also yielded promising results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046841648

Digital Twins represent one concept, where we may use tools and technologies to “map” data (bits) from objects (atoms). It is gaining momentum because the “map” can act as a “compass” to reveal the status of atoms (things, devices, components, machines, people), process visibility and real-time transparency. Adoption of digital proxies, or digital duplicates, may face hurdles due to lack of semantic interoperability between architectures, standards and ontologies. The technologies necessary for automated discovery are in short supply. Progress depends on the convergence of information technology, operational technology and protocol-agnostic telecommunications. Making sense of the data, ability to curate data, and perform data analytics, at the edge (or mist, rather than in the fog or cloud) is key to value. Delivering algorithm engines to the edge, are crucial for edge analytics, if latency is detrimental. The confluence of these, and other factors, may chart the future path for Digital Twins. The number of unknown unknowns, and the known unknowns, in this process, makes it imperative to create global infrastructures and organize groups, to pursue the development of fundamental building blocks. We need new ideas and research in new domains to generate creative and innovative solutions. © 2021 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048741165
