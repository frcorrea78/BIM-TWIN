Inspection should provide reliable information in such format that an infrastructure manager can control his network. Rijkswaterstaat has implemented risk based inspections for structures since 2006. Risk Based Inspection is a process of gathering and analyzing information aimed at timely detection of risks due to undesired events. An undesired event is an event with a negative effect on the required performance of objects. Risk Based Inspection (RBI) is essentially different from traditional inspection, because risk analysis is the core of the inspection, rather than the detection of damages. Risks are defined as the product of the chance of an undesired event and the expected consequences of this event. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863913405

A safe and reliable infrastructure, managed from a multi-perspective life-cycle view, is of vital importance for a sustainable and competitive society. Life Cycle Management (LCM) opts to create an optimal value for society over the life cycle of infrastructure. The fact that many civil assets come to the end of their technical or functional lifespan stimulates the development and implementation of LCM. This paper focuses on the renovation and replacement program of civil infrastructures of the Dutch public asset manager Rijkswaterstaat. In the paper, we distinguish 6 main challenges for asset managers: (1) making reliable prognoses for assets; (2) broadening towards a network approach as an opportunity for redesign; (3) developing innovations for increasing requirements and budget restrictions; (4) realizing adaptive networks to cope with future challenges; (5) combining functionalities to increase added value; and (6) maximizing value for society by playing with complexity. Essential at these six challenges is the interaction with other actors, such as other asset managers, stakeholders, and service providers. Asset managers are recommended to start timely with programs of renovation and replacement, and to develop their organizational competences to meet with the challenges in a way that our networks are fit for future needs. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018643842

This indicator was developed at Rijkswaterstaat as an indicator for the ""end of life"" of objects. It is defined as the ratio between: - the life-cycle costs of maintaining a structure and replacing in a statistically expected replacement year - the life-cycle costs of direct replacement and subsequent maintenance. If this ratio approaches the value of 1, then maintaining becomes less profitable compared to replacement, and it makes sense to assess the functional aspects to evaluate whether replacement may be more beneficial. The EELI can be calculated on the fly as part of an Asset Management System, if all necessary information is available. The EELI is a simple, powerful tool to assess the economical end of life for structures. This paper describes how the EELI works, and how it is used at Rijkswaterstaat. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018642103

In this SLA, the required performance of the infrastructure, the risks and the maintenance budget for the coming four years is agreed upon. The common opinion is, that the relatively short term and lagging character of the performance indicators in the SLA, may lead to sub-optimal decisions in the long run which may lead to a waste of public money. In order to improve transparency and increase the understanding of the long term consequences of SLA decisions, an effective and practical indicator that takes long-term effects in to account is called for. Experience with such practical indicators for maintenance budget decisions is not available in the infrastructure sector, nor in similar sectors. This paper deals with the derivation of the indicators based on existing maintenance planning data. The resulting indicators improve transparency and provide insight in the long term cost development of the required maintenance budget. Further research and development is required for using the indicators for policy and decision making. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941236250

This parameter provides a solid life cycle performance basis for bridge replacement. It is not only developed to give a new perspective to the replacement decision process, but also to support a strategic network management approach for civil infrastructures. The method draws on the principle that a bridge not necessarily has to be end of life at its estimated technical age, as long as it performs better than its expected use. For a bridge this idea could mean that it can reach a higher age than its assumed design life. We quantify Performance Age concept based on a hierarchical model, which consists of a translation of this expected performance with criteria and indicators. A prototype model was tested for three fixed concrete highway bridges managed by Rijkswaterstaat, an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment. The results of this study show that Performance Age can be a useful parameter to predict the end of life of bridges. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063943916

Life Cycle Cost Management (LCCM) relates to the management of cost effects embedded in processes and decision procedures within an organisation over the life cycle. This paper summarises opportunities for the use of LCCM in construction processes and describes how these are currently implemented at the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment (Rijkswaterstaat). By implementing LCCM Rijkswaterstaat strives for delivering a desired performance at minimum cost over the entire life cycle. Traditionally design processes are focussed on creating new infrastructure at the lowest cost of construction. However, the cost of mobility are determined by both founding cost and operating cost. A focus on the founding cost only leads to ineffective investments in mobility. LCCM can provide a solution to achieve better value for money.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874551377

Electrical and mechanical components are critical elements with respect to the RAMS-criteria. Unplanned failure of these components lead to societal impact, unsafe situations or costs. The trend in asset management is to apply data-driven, predictive maintenance. In various fields, novel techniques are used to monitor performance and predict behaviour of electrical and mechanical components. These techniques combine insights and methods from different fields, such as computer and data science with knowledge about the assets. They include data collection techniques, protocols for aggregation, transport and storage of data, fast algorithms to handle and analyse (real time) big data, resulting in early warning systems and decision support techniques for the required maintenance actions. This paper attempts to answer: which technologies fit to the Rijkswaterstaat assets and which steps need to be taken to include relevant technologies to the maintenance and organizational processes in order to move towards predictive maintenance practice? This paper firstly analyses Rijkswaterstaat’ systems (its assets, the characteristics and the state of the art of the maintenance strategy). It secondly scans other industries’ predictive maintenance & monitoring techniques; their characteristics and similarities to the Rijkswaterstaat characteristics and their possible applicability). The paper finally defines a roadmap in order to apply relevant techniques and provide a stepwise application and implementation strategy for Rijkswaterstaat and ends up with conclusion and recommendations. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063968198

The term “Life Cycle Management” (LCM) is introduced as a principle for the management of Life Cycle Performance (LCP), Life Cycle Risks (LCR) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) in a dynamic environment. Rijkswaterstaat is a Dutch government agency responsible for both new construction projects and the asset management of existing national infrastructure. Many examples of “life cycle thinking’ can be found in all processes at Rijkswaterstaat. However, there are many different perspectives on life cycle thinking. Slowly all these separate processes become increasingly integrated in a holistic manner. Life Cycle Management could be a binding approach to bring together all these different perspectives. Full scale implementation requires a challenging cultural change too. This paper summarizes different life cycle perspectives at Rijkswaterstaat, each in a different stage of development, and evaluates the possibilities for integral Life Cycle Management. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063945833
