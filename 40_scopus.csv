They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

A few special landscapes may have 'universal' or 'outstanding' values, but almost all landscapes will be valued in multiple ways by those people who are closely associated with them. It is important that those making decisions affecting landscapes are aware of the potential nature and range of cultural values, particularly where these values are not accounted for using standardised landscape assessment techniques. This article describes the development of the Cultural Values Model, which offers an integrated conceptual framework for understanding the potential range of values that might be present within a landscape, and the potential dynamics between these values. The model emerged out of community-based research undertaken in two landscapes in New Zealand, and is discussed in the context of the contribution that landscapes can make to cultural identity and sustainability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This approach involves a 3D modeling stage and the integration of the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further management and analysis. The modeling stage is carried out using a new concept; Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) which has been developed at the Dublin Institute of Technology [12]. Historic Building Information Modeling is a system for modeling historic structures from laser scan and photogrammetric data using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded scripting language within the BIM software called Geometric Descriptive Language (GDL). These objects are combined and mapped onto the survey data to build the entire model. After the 3D model has been created the next stage involves integrating the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further analysis. The international framework for 3D city modeling, CityGML has been adopted for this purpose. CityGML provides an interoperable framework for modeling 3D geometries, semantics, topology and appearance properties [13]. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between parametric CAD modeling and 3D GIS while using benefits from both systems to help document and analyze cultural heritage sites. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872036464

Professionals from both domains are looking for solutions to seamlessly integrate such models for various purposes such as, building and construction analysis, urban planning, tourism, cadastre, homeland security, etc. Researchers suggested that the best approach for such integration is harmonised semantics, which will allow formal mappings between the design (BIM) and real world (GIS) models. Although many geometric models have been developed in both domains, the number of semantic models is relatively few. Two most prominent semantic models in the design and real worlds are currently IFC and CityGML. Several studies demonstrate the transfer of information from IFC models into the CityGML but the literature is lacking a formal and descriptive framework for automatic generation of buildings in CityGML using the IFC models.

It is suggested that value typologies are often designed and implemented without understanding the implicit consequences of the inclusion and omission of ‘values’. It is also suggested that typologies often fail to prompt the necessary questions to develop satisfactorily detailed understandings of heritage significance, resulting in decisions being based on implicit, rather than explicit, value assessments in practice. Mindful of the problems associated with ‘universalising’ context specific typologies, a broad framework for assessing and communicating significance is proposed. In order to encourage holistic approaches, the framework is designed to combat the false dichotomies of cultural/natural and tangible/intangible heritage; it is hoped this will make the framework widely applicable. Without downplaying the necessity of diverse participation in assessing significance, the framework is designed to identify aspects of weakness and preference in cases where adequate consultation is not possible. © 2016 L.

The Superintendence Office carried on the restoration project with the scientific support of the Università degli Studi de L'Aquila and the Università La Sapienza di Roma, under the coordination of the Politecnico di Milano. ENIservizi, aware of the BIM potential in the complex building and infrastructure domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM from the laser scanner and photogrammetric surveying to support the diagnostic analysis, the design project, the tender and the restoration itself, today still on course. Plans and vertical sections were delivered (2012) starting from the surveying campaigns (February and June 2013), together with the first HBIM advancement from the end of 2012 in support of the preliminary-definitive-executive steps of the restoration design project (2013-14-15). Five years later, this paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in addition to the positive and critical aspects relating HBIM feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging restoration work. In particular, the Collemaggio BIM experience anticipated the new Italian Public Procurement Legislation (D.Lgs 50/2016, Nuovo Codice degli Appalti pubblici) aligned with to the EUPPD 24/2014: The EU Directive on Public Procurement asked all the 28 EU countries to adopt building informative modelling by February 2016 in order to support the whole LCM (Life Cycle Management), starting from the project and the intervention, through rewarding scores or mandatory regulations. Many analyses foresees to save from around 5% to 15% of the overall investment by adopting mature BIM (Level 3 to 5), particularly 4D remotely controlled BIM in support of the LCM, as in the case of maintenance and management process. The tender for Basilica restoration was published in 2015: The process was not developed enough to introduce selective criteria based on BIM adoption by the Construction Industry due to the lack of legislation at that time and the lack of BIM skills among the companies. Nevertheless ENIservizi also separately funded aside the HBIM of the Basilica to tackle an advanced BIM able to address decision-making processes in the heritage domain among the different actors: To support operators, architects, structural engineers, economic computation, construction site management and restoration, the theoretical and practical approach adopted by the HBIM, overcame the current logic based on sequential LoD (from simplex to complex, from the preliminary to the executive design) that is typical of new constructions in favour of a complex LoD approach that could guarantee management of the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each component and the maximum degree of knowledge in order to derive the decisions from the starting phases of the project. On the lesson learnt from this experience, the process of updating the current codification criteria (UNI11337-2009) was started with a draft proposal stimulating a debate for the future of HBIM adoption. © Authors 2017.

In this study, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data from Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, and Sentinel-2A have been exploited along with spatial analysis to investigate the area of the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt), severely threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl. The results from our analyses showed that the urban expansion continuously occurred during the whole investigated period causing an increasing in urban areas around (1) 1.316 km2 from 1967 to 1984, (2) 1.705 km2 from 1984 to 2000, (3) 0.978 km2 from 2000 to 2003, (4) 2.314 km2 from 2003 to 2011, and (5) 1.377 km2 from 2011 to 2017. The random urban expansion caused bad sewage networks and high groundwater depth which in turn affected the archaeological areas directly (as evident on a landscape view) and indirectly by causing changes (growing) in the level of ground water depth and increasing and accelerating weathering phenomena. The quantification and mapping of urban sprawl enabled us not only to quantify and spatially characterize urban sprawl but also to create a model to mitigate the impact and provide some operational recommendations to protect the archaeological site.

The ""DNA"" of Preventive Conservation. Various authors so far support the argument that preventive conservation is an effective way to respond to the challenges society faces with the preservation of its Cultural Heritage (Van Balen, 2013). A few decades of experiences with the application of preventive conservation in the field of immovable heritage in the form of Monumentenwacht in The Netherland and in Flanders have shown that a good monitoring of the state of preservation with a strong push for maintenance activities contributes to more preservation of authenticity, to more cost-effective preservation and to empowering society in dealing with heritage preservation. (Cebron, 2008) An analysis of these and similar experiences demonstrates that these ""Monumentenwacht"" activities represent only a part of what could be named a preventive conservation system. Other fields in which prevention is advocated for its higher efficiency, show the importance of system thinking in the development of improved strategies. Applying this approach to the field of the immovable heritage, referring to the initial results shown by the Monumentenwacht practices, it becomes clear that different dimension are at stake simultaneously: The preservation of authenticity or integrity, the management of resources and the connection with society. It shows that the analysis of challenges in heritage preservation and the development of strategies is à priori multifaceted and therefor has a certain level of complexity. The sustainability of the preservation of cultural heritage buildings and sites can be measured according to its multiple economic, social, environmental and cultural support. The Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe report shows that the more diverse the support is for cultural heritage preservation actions, the more those actions will contribute to sustainable development and the more sustainable the preservation of that heritage will be. This reasoning has led to the ""upstream approach"" which argues that cultural heritage preservation can benefit from a variety of resources which do not necessarily have to be earmarked for it à priori (CHCfE, 2015). It leads to arguing for an holistic and integrated approach for cultural heritage preservation that taps into different kinds of resources, which requires acknowledgement of the complex nature of understanding and managing heritage values into an overall societal development goal (Vandesande, 2017). © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030227912

Filarete, a well-known Renaissance architect and theorist, planned the hospital in the 15th century, but the ice house was built two centuries later with a double-storey irregular octagonal brick structure, half under and half above ground, that enclosed another circular structure called the ice room. The purpose of the double-walled structure was to store ice in the middle and store and preserve perishable food and medicine at the outer side of the ice room. During World War II, major portions of the hospital and the above-ground section of the ice house was bombed and heavily damaged. Later, in 1962, the hospital was restored and rehabilitated into a university, with the plan to conceal the ice house's remaining structure in the courtyard, which ultimately was excavated and incorporated into a new library for the university. A team of engineers, architects, and students from Politecnico di Milano and Carleton University conducted two heritage recording surveys in 2015 and 2016 to fully document the existing condition of the ice house, resulting in an inclusive laser scanner and photogrammetric point cloud dataset. The point cloud data was consolidated and imported into two leading parametric modelling software, Autodesk Revit© and Graphisoft ArchiCAD©, with the goal to develop two BIMs in parallel in order to study and compare the software BIM workflow, parametric capabilities, attributes to capture the complex geometry with high accuracy, and the duration for parametric modelling. The comparison study of the two software revealed their workflow limitations, leading to integration of the BIM generative process with other pure modelling software such as Rhinoceros©. The integrative BIM process led to the production of a comprehensive BIM model that documented related historic data and the existing physical state of the ice house, to be used as a baseline for preventive maintenance, monitoring, and future conservation projects. © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030234708

Recently, many approaches have included the SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology in their domain knowledge representation and relevant applications. In this work, we merge the SSN using the CORE (Conservation Reasoning) ontology, an ontology which is based on empirical analysis, scientific knowledge and existing vocabularies of the conservation domain. Incorporating many of the existing properties of both ontologies and proposing additional ones, we integrate the majority of SSN classes in the CORE ontology, creating a new merged ontology that combines conservation procedures data and rules with sensor and environmental information. Furthermore, we create ontology-based rules, using the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), in order to express preventive conservation guidelines and rules based on sensor and object current data. © 2018 CEUR-WS.
