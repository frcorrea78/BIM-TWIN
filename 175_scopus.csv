The combination of processes (climate drivers and hazards) leading to a significant impact is referred to as a 'compound event'. Traditional risk assessment methods typically only consider one driver and/or hazard at a time, potentially leading to underestimation of risk, as the processes that cause extreme events often interact and are spatially and/or temporally dependent. Here we show how a better understanding of compound events may improve projections of potential high-impact events, and can provide a bridge between climate scientists, engineers, social scientists, impact modellers and decision-makers, who need to work closely together to understand these complex events. © 2018 The Publisher.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046890068

Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves longterm security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency 'trust-but-verify' validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049798657

This paper addresses resilience within infrastructure systems, after an extreme event such as an earthquake. It develops a conceptual framework for understanding the factors that influence the resilience of infrastructure systems in terms of two dimensions: robustness (the extent of system function that is maintained) and rapidity (the time required to return to full system operations and productivity). The paper also characterizes a framework through the use of flow diagrams for understanding kinds of decisions that can be pursued within infrastructure systems to foster these two dimensions of system resilience. It uses the results of several data-gathering efforts, including preparation of a database on infrastructure interactions, interviews with hospital emergency managers, and interviews with other kinds of infrastructure system operators. The paper then applies this framework to the example of planning for system resilience within individual hospitals in the context of earthquake mitigation efforts. The results indicate that common decision contexts (both ex-ante and ex-post) arise across many different infrastructure contexts when considering ways to make infrastructure systems more resilient. The detailed discussion of hospitals points to the importance of learning from experience in previous disasters, of managing the availability of the facility's staff in a disaster, of daily communication among the staff to ensure high utilization of the available hospital capacity, and of flexibility in ways of addressing specific system failures such as water. The results also point to several ways in which the flow diagrams can be used for ongoing planning and implementation to enhance infrastructure system resilience. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of sustainability rose to prominence in the late 1980s and became a central issue in world politics, when the construction industry began to generate the first sustainable building assessment systems with more or less equally weighted environmental, economic, and social aspects for office buildings over their life cycles. On the other hand, resilience is usually connected to the occurrence of extreme events during the life cycle of structures and infrastructures. In the last decade, it has been used to minimize specifically direct and indirect losses from hazards through enhanced resistance and robustness to extreme events, as well as more effective recovery strategies. A detailed comparison of the studies dealing with either infrastructure sustainability or resilience presented in this paper leads to the conclusion that they have a vast number of similarities and common characteristics. For instance, they both combine structural analyses with social and economic aspects; they both rely on techniques for the life-cycle analysis and decision making; they both are in an early stage, where the academic world is trying to find the best way to promote the application of the scientific results among professional engineers and the industry. Indeed, both approaches try to optimize a system, such as a civil infrastructure system, with respect to structural design, utilized material, maintenance plans, management strategies, and impacts on the society. However, for the most part, researchers and practitioners focusing on either resilience or sustainability operate without a mutual consideration of the findings, which leads to a severe inefficiency. Therefore, this paper suggests that resilience and sustainability are complementary and should be used in an integrated perspective. In particular, the proposed approach is rooted in the wellestablished framework of risk assessment. The impact of the infrastructure and its service states on the society in normal operational conditions (assessed by sustainability analysis) and after exceptional events (assessed by resilience analysis) should be weighted by the associated probabilities of occurrence and combined in a global impact assessment. The proposed perspective and assessment technique is applicable to various types of civil infrastructure systems, but the case of transportation networks and bridge systems is emphasized herein. A numerical application dealing with the comparative analysis of two possible bridge layouts is presented to exemplify the approach. The results show that both resilience and sustainability analyses assess a relevant amount of the impact of the bridge on the community where it is built, so neither one can be neglected. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911459251

However, there is, as yet, no clear methodology or set of metrics to quantify resilience in the context of power systems and in terms of both operational and infrastructure integrity. In this paper, the resilience 'trapezoid' is therefore introduced which extends the resilience 'triangle' that is traditionally used in existing studies, in order to consider the different phases that a power system may experience during an extreme event. The resilience trapezoid is then quantified using time-dependent resilience metrics that are specifically introduced to help capture the critical system degradation and recovery features associated to the trapezoid for different temporal phases of an event. Further, we introduce the concepts of operational resilience and infrastructure resilience to gain additional insights in the system response.

Infectious disease outbreaks, acts of terrorism, social unrest, or financial disasters in addition to natural hazards can all lead to large-scale consequences for the nation and its communities. Communities and the nation thus face difficult fiscal, social, cultural, and environmental choices about the best ways to ensure basic security and quality of life against hazards, deliberate attacks, and disasters. Beyond the unquantifiable costs of injury and loss of life from disasters, statistics for 2011 alone indicate economic damages from natural disasters in the United States exceeded $55 billion, with 14 events costing more than a billion dollars in damages each. One way to reduce the impacts of disasters on the nation and its communities is to invest in enhancing resilience--the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative addresses the broad issue of increasing the nation's resilience to disasters. This book defines ""national resilience"", describes the state of knowledge about resilience to hazards and disasters, and frames the main issues related to increasing resilience in the United States. It also provide goals, baseline conditions, or performance metrics for national resilience and outlines additional information, data, gaps, and/or obstacles that need to be addressed to increase the nation's resilience to disasters. Additionally, the book's authoring committee makes recommendations about the necessary approaches to elevate national resilience to disasters in the United States. Enhanced resilience allows better anticipation of disasters and better planning to reduce disaster losses-rather than waiting for an event to occur and paying for it afterward. Disaster Resilience confronts the topic of how to increase the nation's resilience to disasters through a vision of the characteristics of a resilient nation in the year 2030. Increasing disaster resilience is an imperative that requires the collective will of the nation and its communities. Although disasters will continue to occur, actions that move the nation from reactive approaches to disasters to a proactive stance where communities actively engage in enhancing resilience will reduce many of the broad societal and economic burdens that disasters can cause. © 2012 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Several regions are likely to be exposed to multiple climate hazards, yet their modeling in a joint scheme is still at the early stages. A multi-hazard framework to map exposure to multiple climate extremes in Europe along the twenty-first century is hereby presented. Using an ensemble of climate projections, changes in the frequency of heat and cold waves, river and coastal flooding, streamflow droughts, wildfires and windstorms are evaluated. Corresponding variations in expected annual exposure allow for a quantitative comparison of hazards described by different process characteristics and metrics. Projected changes in exposure depict important variations in hazard scenarios, especially those linked to rising temperatures, and spatial patterns largely modulated by local climate conditions. Results show that Europe will likely face a progressive increase in overall climate hazard with a prominent spatial gradient towards south-western regions mainly driven by the rise of heat waves, droughts and wildfires. Key hotspots emerge particularly along coastlines and in floodplains, often highly populated and economically pivotal, where floods and windstorms could be critical in combination with other climate hazards. Projected increases in exposure will be larger for very extreme events due to their pronounced changes in frequency.

Moreover, faults can manifest through different failure modes in the same component. If timely diagnostics and maintenance actions are not undertaken, then these faults can cause instabilities, inefficient power generation, and other losses. Therefore, it is important not only to understand the various failure modes, and their root causes and effects, but also to develop real-time automated diagnostics tools that can capture the early signatures of fault evolution for mitigating actions. In this respect, this paper presents a review of different failure modes occurring in various micro-grid components including both clean and conventional energy generation systems.

We combine a set of high-resolution climate hazard projections, a detailed representation of physical assets in various sectors and their sensitivity to the hazards, and more than 1100 records of losses from climate extremes in a prognostic modelling framework. We find that damages could triple by the 2020s, multiply six-fold by mid-century, and amount to more than 10 times present damage of €3.4 billion per year by the end of the century due only to climate change. Damage from heatwaves, droughts in southern Europe, and coastal floods shows the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding, windstorms, and forest fires will also increase in Europe, with varying degrees of change across regions. Economic losses are highest for the industry, transport, and energy sectors. Future losses will not be incurred equally across Europe.

Two significant challenges of resilience analysis are to (1) quantify the resilience associated with a given recovery curve; and (2) develop a rigorous mathematical model of the recovery process. To quantify resilience, a mathematical approach is proposed that systematically describes the recovery curve in terms of partial descriptors, called resilience metrics. The proposed resilience metrics have simple and clear interpretations, and their definitions are general so that they can characterize the resilience associated with any recovery curve. This paper also introduces a reliability-based definition of damage levels which is well-suited for probabilistic resilience analysis. For the recovery modeling, a stochastic formulation is proposed that models the impact of recovery activities and potential disrupting shocks, which could happen during the recovery, on the system state.

Therefore, resilience assessment of infrastructure assets to extreme events and sequences of diverse hazards is of paramount importance for maintaining their functionality. Yet, the resilience assessment commonly assumes single hazards and ignores alternative approaches and decisions in the restoration strategy. It has now been established that infrastructure owners and operators consider different factors in their restoration strategies depending on the available resources and their priorities, the importance of the asset and the level of damage. Currently, no integrated framework that accounts for the nature and sequence of multiple hazards and their impacts, the different strategies of restoration, and hence the quantification of resilience in that respect exists and this is an acknowledged gap that needs urgently filling. This paper provides, for the first time in the literature, a classification of multiple hazard sequences considering their nature and impacts. Subsequently, a novel framework for the quantitative resilience assessment of critical infrastructure, subjected to multiple hazards is proposed, considering the vulnerability of the assets to hazard actions, and the rapidity of the damage recovery, including the temporal variability of the hazards. The study puts forward a well-informed asset resilience index, which accounts for the full, partial or no restoration of asset damage between the subsequent hazard occurrences. The proposed framework is then applied on a typical highway bridge, which is exposed to realistic multiple hazard scenarios, considering pragmatic restoration strategies. The case study concludes that there is a significant effect of the occurrence time of the second hazard on the resilience index and a considerable error when using simple superimposition of resilience indices from different hazards, even when they are independent in terms of occurrence. This potentially concerns all critical infrastructure assets and, hence, this paper provides useful insights for the resilience-based design and management of infrastructure throughout their lifetime, leading to cost savings and improved services. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the importance of the framework and how this can be utilised to estimate the resilience of networks to provide a quantification of the resilience at a regional and country scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078262632

Digital technologies have the potential to provide rapid resilience assessments in a quantifiable and engineered manner for transport infrastructure, which is exposed to multiple natural and human-induced hazards and diverse loads throughout their life-cycle. Physical damage and disruption of networks and interdependent systems may cause tremendous socioeconomic impact, affecting world economies and societies. Nowadays, transport infrastructure stakeholders have shifted the requirements in risk and resilience assessment. The expectation is that risk is estimated efficiently, almost in real-time with high accuracy, aiming at maximising the functionality and minimising losses. Nevertheless, no integrated framework exists for quantifying resilience to diverse hazards, based on structural and functionality monitoring (SHFM) data, and this is the main capability gap that this paper envisages filling. Monitoring systems have been used widely in transport infrastructure and have been studied extensively in the literature. Data can facilitate prognosis of the asset condition and the functionality of the network, informing computer-based asset and traffic models, which can assist in defining actionable performance indicators, for diagnosis and for defining risk and loss expediently and accurately. Evidence exists that SHFM is an enabler of resilience. However, strategies are absent in support of monitoring-based resilience assessment in transport infrastructure management. In response to the above challenge, this paper puts forward for the first time in the international literature, a roadmap for monitoring-based quantification of resilience for transport infrastructure, based on a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art. It is a holistic asset management roadmap, which identifies the interactions among the design, monitoring, risk assessment and quantification of resilience to multiple hazards. Monitoring is embraced as a vital component, providing expedient feedback for recovery measures, accelerating decision-making for adaptation of changing ecosystems and built environments, utilising emerging technologies, to continuously deliver safer and resilient transport infrastructure. © 2020",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089074515

Then, an “individual module” describes dynamically the emotional aspects using (i) the Decision Field Theory, (ii) a stationary stochastic model, and (iii) the results coming from a questionnaire. An agent-based model with integrated human behavior is proposed to test critical infrastructures in emergency conditions without performing full scale evacuation tests.

Science and technology can play a crucial role in the world's ability to reduce casualties, physical damage, and interruption to critical infrastructure due to natural hazards and their complex interactions. The SFDRR encourages better access to technological innovations combined with increased DRR investments in developing cost-effective approaches and tackling global challenges. To this aim, it is essential to link multi- and interdisciplinary research and technological innovations with policy and engineering/DRR practice. To share knowledge and promote discussion on recent advances, challenges, and future directions on ‘Innovations in Earthquake Risk Reduction for Resilience’, a group of experts from academia and industry met in London, UK, in July 2019. The workshop focused on both cutting-edge ‘soft’ (e.g., novel modelling methods/frameworks, early warning systems, disaster financing and parametric insurance) and ‘hard’ (e.g., novel structural systems/devices for new structures and retrofitting of existing structures, sensors) risk-reduction strategies for the enhancement of structural and infrastructural earthquake safety and resilience. The workshop highlighted emerging trends and lessons from recent earthquake events and pinpointed critical issues for future research and policy interventions.

However, current practice still remains manual, time consuming, and labor intensive, which usually requires exhaustive manual data extraction from drawings and other databases. Inspection of the interior environment can be even more challenging due to the complexity and interconnectivity of tasks. Systems based on mobile devices could potentially enhance the inspection process and reduce the required time by allowing the inspector to acquire progress data by simply walking around the site. This paper presents an automated method that allows a real-time comparison between the registered as-built and as-planned data while the inspector navigates inside a building under construction to perform inspection wearing a Microsoft HoloLens device. The proposed method automatically detects if volumetric objects such as beams, columns, walls, and so on exist in reality according to plan.

Theoretically, such an approach could help many organizations and systems address the inherent uncertainty and complexity within their operations and better overcome disruptions or shocks, which would otherwise threaten to degrade or destroy the organization's core operations. In practice, however, a lack of consistency in how resilience is applied and measured can limit its effectiveness to assist organizations in this task. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is particularly interested in applying principles of resilience to emerging threats to economic and social prosperity amongst its member states, yet also applies resilience in various application areas via comparable yet different definitions. A greater harmonization of resilience across OECD's Directorates and affiliate groups is intended to improve the organization's capacity to identify and address emerging systemic threats and produce suggestions for good governance to meet these threats as they arise in the coming years. © 2018 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055717436

In particular, the possibility to use computer simulations to model and study the behavior of thousands of people during an emergency evacuation can provide valuable information to support many processes involved in emergency management. To this end, this work presents IdealCity, a hybrid model for evacuation simulation that couples the representation of the built environment and the transportation network with an agent-based simulation of the urban population. IdealCity can estimate the buildings’ damages and debris generated by a seismic event along with their effects on the other model layers (the agents and the roads). Besides that, the simulation takes into consideration as well the emergency response system by modeling shelters, hospitals, and ambulances (each of which has a specific behavior within the environment). The model has been implemented and tested in a challenging test-bed that considers about 900,000 individuals, four different seismic scenarios, and three different times of the day. Results show that IdealCity can be used not only for predicting the population response but also for allowing decision-makers to estimate and intervene on critical response parameters, thus improving the inherent community resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098696201

Hence, to manage these risks and adapt to changing conditions, well-informed resilience assessment and decision-making tools are required. These tools are commonly associated with resilience metrics, which quantify the capacity of transport networks to withstand and absorb damage, recover after a disruption and adapt to future changes. Several resilience metrics have been proposed in the literature, however, there is lack of practical applications and worked examples. This paper attempts to fill this gap and provide engineers and novice researchers with a review of available metrics on the basis of the main properties of resilience, i.e. robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness and rapidity. The main steps of resilience assessment for transport infrastructure such as bridges are discussed and the use of fragility and restoration functions to assess the robustness and rapidity of recovery is demonstrated. Practical examples are provided using a bridge exposed to scour effects as a benchmark. Also, an illustrative example of a systems of assets is provided and different aspects of resilience-based decision making are discussed, aiming to provide a comprehensive, yet straightforward, understanding of resilience. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121911194

Sea level rise associated with a global mean temperature rise of 2 °C would place 100 airports below mean sea level, whilst 1238 airports are in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone. A global analysis has assessed the risk to airports in terms of expected annual disruption to routes. The method integrates globally available data of airport location, flight routes, extreme water levels, standards of flood protection and scenarios of sea level rise. Globally, the risk of disruption could increase by a factor of 17–69 by 2100, depending on the rate of sea level rise. A large number of airports are at risk in Europe, Norther American and Oceania, but risks are highest in Southeast and East Asia. These coastal airports are disproportionately important to the global airline network, by 2100 between 10 and 20% of all routes are at risk of disruption. Sea level rise therefore poses a systemic risk to global passenger and freight movements. Airports already benefit from substantial flood protection that reduces present risk by a factor of 23. To maintain risk in 2100 at current levels could cost up to $57BN. Although the cost of protecting larger airports is higher, busier airports are typically well protected and more likely to have better access to adaptation finance. However, 995 coastal airports operate 5 commercial routes or fewer. More detailed consideration of these airports shows that regions, especially low lying islands, will experience disproportionate impacts because airports can provide important economic, social, and medical lifelines. Route disruption was used as the risk metric due to its global coverage and relationship with direct economic impacts. Further work should collate a wider range of impact metrics that reflect the criticality of an airport in terms of the isolation and socio-economic context of the location it serves. © 2020",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099043822

Terrestrial monitoring systems can provide information about assets and their condition. Yet, they fall short of engineering requirements related to the history of the asset loading, deterioration and potential damage, which is of paramount importance in risk-based decision-making by infrastructure operators. This capability gap can be filled by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Monitoring in conjunction with engineering forensics and judgment. This paper puts forward this hybrid approach to assess the structural condition of a landmark bridge by coupling advanced Differential SAR Tomography (D-TomoSAR) techniques with an adaptive deformation model, environmental measurements and engineering evidence and evaluations. A dataset of 360 Sentinel A &B images covering the period between 10/2014 and 2/2020 and temperature records to account for seasonal deformation were deployed. Displacement products, such as the development of annual displacement and time series were calculated demonstrating a strong correlation with temperature variation and resulting deformations of the asset. The spatiotemporally evolving deformation trends of the bridge superstructure were derived, and vulnerable deck locations were identified on the basis of engineering forensics, judgment and progressive displacements calculated from the D-TomoSAR technique. The vertical displacement profile at the critical deck location was developed reaching a displacement velocity of 1.8 mm/year and potential deterioration issues are manifested as potential causes of the observed geometric alterations. Based on the D-TomoSAR results matched with engineering evidence and on-site visual inspections and judgment, this study contributed to the decision-making process. This research is a pilot showcase of D-TomoSAR for the bridge monitoring, not only providing mm-level quantitative measurements of the bridge in a 6-year observation span using medium resolution Sentinel-1 SAR images alone but also indirectly identifying potential structural defects in the north section of the bridge. This research is a primer example of how we can deploy diverse evidence to facilitate targeted adaptation measures and prioritize restoration strategies to facilitate asset owners in better decision making. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121142246
