Previous research unveils students' deficits in understanding the behavior of structural elements in a three-dimensional (3D) context due to the shortcomings of traditional lecturing approaches, which put too much emphasis on the analysis of individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to analyzing complex structures with a large number of interconnected elements. In this paper, the authors introduce a new pedagogy for teaching structural analysis that incorporates mobile augmented reality (AR) and interactive 3D visualization technology. The goal of this study is to enhance the contents used in structural analysis textbooks and on worksheets by visualizing discrete structural members employing AR along with interactive 3D models in order to illustrate how the structures behave under different loading conditions. Students can interactively change the load and observe the reaction resulting from this change with the instant feedback provided by the AR interface. The feasibility of AR concepts and interaction metaphors, as well as the potential of using AR for teaching structural analysis are investigated, specifically by focusing on challenges regarding content integration and interaction. An AR application is designed and developed, and a pilot study is conducted in a junior level structural analysis class to assess the pedagogical impact and the design concepts employed by the AR tool. Control and test groups are deployed, and students’ performance is measured using pre- and post-tests. The results of the pilot study indicate that the utilized AR design concepts have potential to contribute to students’ learning by providing interactive and 3D visualization features, which support constructive engagement and retention of information in students. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031736734

An extensive body of research cites the lack of motivation and engagement in the learning process as a major underlying reason of this decline. It has been discussed that if properly implemented, instructional technology can enhance student engagement and the quality of learning. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to implement and assess the effectiveness of an augmented reality (AR)-based pedagogical tool on student learning. For this purpose, a model building design and assembly experiment with two separate (control and test) treatments were conducted in an undergraduate construction and civil engineering course. In each treatment, performance (with respect to three primary and three secondary measures) and workload data (with respect to six NASA TLX indicators) were collected and assessed. Both treatments were also videotaped for post-analysis and further observations of students' performance. It was found that students in the test group (who used the AR tool) performed better than students in the control group with respect to certain (but not all) measures. In addition, test group students spent more time on collaboration, communication, and exchanging ideas. Overall, students ranked the effectiveness of the AR tool very high and stated that it has a good potential to transform traditional teaching methods.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928328308

STEAM education has been proposed as a way to offer relevant problems to solve while drawing on creative and collaborative skills to increase interest and engagement in these fields. Despite the interest in increasing STEAM globally, research on the efficacy of instructional approaches, including ways to assess collaborative problem solving (CPS), is lacking. Results: This paper reports the development of a rubric, named Co-Measure, for researchers and educators to use to assess student collaboration, at the individual level, when students are working in K-12 STEAM activities. Our project team provides the rationale, process, validation, initial iterations to the rubric, and next steps to inform STEM researchers and move STEAM instruction and learning forward. A final rubric is provided and made freely available to researchers and educators. Conclusions: As STEAM education gains popularity in K-12 schools, assessment of student collaboration is needed to identify the dimensions of the skill in order to provide appropriate problem solving opportunities within instruction. The assessment is also needed to adjust instruction when students are not offered opportunities to work collaboratively during STEAM activities. Utilizing existing generalized frameworks of CPS provided the initial guide to direct research specific to CPS in STEAM activities. Using an iterative process to identify and evaluate attributes of student behavior associated with CPS in STEAM classrooms by a project team comprised of learning scientists, educational researchers and psychometricians allowed for rigorous research while drawing on appropriate expertise. Co-Measure has the potential to be modified and broadly extended to assess CPS in elementary and post-secondary classrooms using STEAM instructional practices. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051833968

In line with today’s AECO industry necessities and government mandates, globally active BIM educationalists and researchers are designing BIM educational frameworks, curricula and courses. These educationalists and researchers are also generating solutions to the obstacles faced during integration of BIM education into tertiary education systems (TESs). However, BIM researchers have taken few efforts recently to provide an overview of the level of BIM education across the globe through review and analysis of the latest publications associated with BIM education in TESs. Hence, this study attempts to fill this gap by providing a review of the efforts of globally active educationalists and researchers to educate AECO students about BIM in the context of advanced engineering education with visualization. Method: In our study, an investigation of texts in the field of academic BIM education was conducted. Keywords such as “BIM education”, “BIM curriculum”, “BIM course”, and “visualization in engineering education” were used to search for publications ranging from 2010 to the present day. Textual and content analysis were employed to arrange BIM-related qualitative textual data into similar sets of conceptual categories for the purpose of analyzing trends in today’s global academic BIM education research. Results: This study generated six conceptual categories by arranging qualitative textual data from 70 collected BIM publications in order to build an understanding of active BIM educationalists and researchers efforts: (a) identifying needs for BIM in tertiary educational institutions (TEIs), (b) identifying essential BIM skillsets for BIM education, (c) developing BIM educational frameworks, (d) developing BIM curricula, (e) experimenting with BIM courses, and (f) developing strategies to overcome BIM educational issues. Through this process of review and analysis, current research gaps in academic BIM education across the globe are identified. Conclusion: This process of review and analysis of global BIM education research trends resulted in a conceptual categorization of BIM educationalists and researchers’ efforts in TES. This categorization and review of the collected publications can serve as a knowledge base for: (a) identifying major issues involved in BIM education, (b) developing strategies to incorporate BIM into TES, and (c) developing BIM frameworks and curricula in the context of tertiary education, which can assist BIM educators with taking BIM education in TES to the next level for visualization in advanced engineering education. Through analyzing global BIM education research trends, this study also provides future research suggestions on academic BIM education across the globe. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the relationship between current tertiary BIM education and visualization. © 2016, The Author(s).",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040254044

The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools.

To identify the effects 3D printing may have on student experiences and the learning of the design process, students were asked to create a design and create a prototype of that design. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows an experimental design involving four total courses of interior design students. After conceptualizing a design, students were randomly selected to either create the prototype by hand or given access to 3D printing equipment. The models were graded by three subject experts using a rubric that focused on three key aspects of the model project, namely, craftsmanship, design quality and scale (proportion). Findings: All three measures produced significant mean differences with a medium effect size when comparing the 3D printed models to the traditionally built models. Additional observations provided insights into the design processes approached by students using hand-constructed and 3D printed modeling. The most notable difference was the propensity for curved and rectilinear shapes by available design technologies. Research limitations/implications: The experiment showed that the design technology (3D printing) did have an impact on the designs students conceptualized. This suggests that students do connect ideation to implementation, and the availability of enabling technology impacts the design process. This research was conducted in an interior design environment and consists of primarily female students. The experimental research may be limited to design programs with similar student populations and levels of exposure to various design technologies. Practical implications: This research is designed to provide instructors and programs valuable information when looking at implementing new design technologies into the curriculum. Instructors are made aware that new design technologies do impact student design strategies. Additionally, although certain design technologies allow for revisions, it was apparent that students continued to be resistant to revise their initial models suggesting instructors prepare to address this issue in instruction. Social implications: There is a strong body of research indicating inequality in education where students have differing access to technologies in schools. This research shows that 3D printing, similar to many technologies in education, can impact the cognitive processes of content being learned. Originality/value: There is limited research on how design technologies impact design cognition and the experiences of design students. This paper looked specifically at one design technology (3D printing/rapid prototyping) and how it impacts the processes and quality of design, in addition to the quality of design products (prototypes or models).

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, moni-toring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling sys-tems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19.

In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016214116

The purpose of the study is to examine the current state of knowledge and practice of existing courses, which use the AR concept; to conduct a pedagogical experiment by teaching students how to create an information model of a building structure using the AR concept; to study the impact of the AR technology on students, lecturers, on the quality of students' design works and project presentation. The research methods used were a set of various, complementing each other methods, which can be divided into two groups: 1) theoretical: analysis of the teachers' and psychologists' works on the point of the research, analysis of methodological and educational literature; empirical: observation, statement, pedagogical experiment. The authors synthesized qualitative and quantitative AR research in the field of education. A team of students from Saint-Petersburg Mining University, Kazan (Volga region) Federal University and Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation solved a design problem using AR and created an informational 3D-model of the structure. Existing methods of teaching students were supplemented and updated by the method of graphical presentation of the results, with due regard for AR-technologies. It has been found that at the present moment, the concept of AR has gained popularity not only among designers and planners, but also among schoolteachers, as well as among teachers at engineering universities. The absence of scientifically substantiated and proven programs and training materials for training students of DGECG using AR has also been confirmed. The necessity of further scientific research in the field of AR for DGECG has been substantiated.

It is needed to figure out and present the status of building information modeling education and research in this region. This study used literature review and case studies to find out the state of research and education in China. The status of building information modeling research and education in China was revealed.

These meaningful-learning goals have been tied most specifically to cognitive engagement, a construct that is often difficult for instructors to assess on their own. While it has been shown that certain instructional practices are tied to higher cognitive engagement in students, tools to measure instructional practices and student engagement have remained largely isolated in their development and use. Results: This research uses previously developed instruments to simultaneously assess modes of cognitive engagement in students (Student Course Cognitive Engagement Instrument [SCCEI]) and instructional practices (Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey [PIPS]) within a course. A sample of 19 STEM courses was recruited to participate in this study, with instructors and students each self-reporting data. Results from the instructor and students in each course were scored, and ANOVA and partial correlation analysis were conducted on the sample. ANOVA indicated the significance of and classroom structure on student engagement. From the correlation analysis, a significant relationship was found between four student-reported modes of cognitive engagement and instructor-reported teaching practices. Conclusions: With an understanding of student engagement response to classroom structure, instructors may consider their teaching environment when implementing instructional practices. Moreover, Interactivity with Peers, the deepest mode of cognitive engagement suggested by previous research, was correlated with instructional practices in our study, suggesting that instructors may be able to shape their students’ learning by encouraging collaboration in the classroom. We also found that assessment played a role in students’ cognitive engagement; this indicates that instructors may wish to thoughtfully consider their methods of assessment to facilitate modes of cognitive engagement associated with deeper learning of course material. By understanding factor correlations, the PIPS and SCCEI can be used in tandem to understand impacts of instructional practices on student cognitive engagement within a course. We conclude that there is a need for ongoing research to study the interplay of instructional practices and student cognitive engagement as instruments are developed to measure such phenomena. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083855015

Consequently, the industry is faced with a loss of expertise and practical knowledge required to successfully deliver construction projects, especially with older and more experienced employees retiring at a rate faster than the incoming workforce can replace them. The future of the industry is dependent on the competence of this next generation of employees joining the construction workforce. Therefore, it is highly desired that new employees be equipped with the necessary skills and abilities required to manage the complexities inherent in construction processes successfully. The lack of practical exposure to on-site construction situations during a new employee's college education results in a limited spatial and temporal understanding of complex construction processes, which adversely influences these new employees' abilities to solve problems, therefore limiting their initial productivity. This study simulates the environmental context and spatio-temporal constraints of several construction assemblies by using Augmented Reality (AR) technology combined with a layer of simulated visualizations. The superimposition of BIM-based model elements and images on real-time site videos functions as a novel pedagogical technique which virtually incorporates jobsite experiences into the classroom. The jobsite becomes an interactive experience subjected to digital manipulation which reinforces and highlights key technique and constructability based concepts. Testing revealed that construction management students exposed to AR-enabled content were better able to identify the elements and tasks related to masonry, roof, and steel construction when compared to those students who received typical in-class instruction. The results further indicate that ART combined with typical classroom instruction provides educators with an advantage as they strive to prepare their students for successful careers in construction.

Some have engineering training, some do not. This paper presents a study to explore the educational pathways of adult Makers and how they intersect with engineering. This research is guided by the following research questions: (1) What can we learn about the educational pathways of adult Makers through the lens of constructivist grounded theory? and (2) How do the educational pathways of Makers intersect with engineering? This study relied on qualitative interviews, using artifact elicitation interviews and constructivist critical incident technique interviews, of 42 adult Makers. Results: Through inductive analysis of a collection of interviews with Makers, a theme emerged where Makers from different educational backgrounds and with different careers (e.g., art, STEM, business) were making artifacts that had similar purposes. We present two cases of parallel pathways, (1) musical artifacts and (2) large-scale interactive artifacts, to demonstrate the multiple, parallel life pathways that Makers take to making their artifacts and the contextual events and activities that are critical to the direction of these pathways. Conclusions: The stories and life pathways of adult learners engaged in Making can offer valuable insight into how we might identify practices that promote the access and success of a larger and more diverse population of students for engineering. Makers are engaged in activities that embody the Engineer of 2020 (e.g., lifelong learning, creativity, and practical ingenuity).

This study explores a focal question about how these new characteristics may affect the education and research related to CPS in 2030, the date identified by the United Nations to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, first, we have conducted a trend spotting activity, seeking to identify possible influencing factors that may have a great impact on the future of CPS education and research. These factors were clustered in a total of 12 trends – four certainties; namely connectivity, electrification, data and automation – and eight uncertainties; namely intelligence, data ethics, labour market, lifelong learning, higher education, trust in technology, technological development speed, and sustainable development goals. After that, two of the eight uncertainties are identified and used to construct a scenario matrix, which includes four scenarios. These two uncertainties – the so-called strategic uncertainties – are: fulfilment of sustainable development goals and the nature of the technological development, respectively. These two important uncertainties are considered to build the scenarios due to their potential impact on the research and education of CPS. For instance, sustainable development goals are significant targets for many initiatives, organisations and countries. While 2030 is the deadline to achieve these goals, the relationship between the sustainable development goals related to CPS research and education is not studied well. Similarly, the speed of technological development is seen as a driving force behind future CPS. However, the effect of this speed to CPS research and education environment is not known. Different outcomes of the chosen two uncertainties are, then, combined with the remaining trends and uncertainties. Consequently, four scenarios are derived. The Terminator scenario illustrates a dystopian future where profit is the driving force behind technological progress and sustainable development goals are not accomplished. In contrast, The Iron Giant scenario represents the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals where technological development is the force behind the accomplishment of these goals. The scenario called Slow Progress represents a future where gradual technological improvements are present, but sustainability is still not seen as concerning the issue. The Humanist scenario illustrates a future where slow technological development is happening yet sustainable development goals are successfully implemented. Finally, the scenarios are used to initiate discussions by illustrating what the future of research and education could look like and a list of strategies for future CPS research and education environments is proposed. To this end, we invite educators, researchers, institutions and governments to develop the necessary strategies to enable data-orientated, continuous, interdisciplinary, collaborative, ethical, and sustainable research and education by improving digital fluency, advancing digital equality, contributing to new ways of teaching complex thinking, expanding access to learning platforms and preparing next generations to adapt for a rapidly changing future of work conditions. © 2020",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098085415

These tools are increasingly used in advanced industries for several purposes. The digital representation provides both the elements and the dynamics of how an Internet of Things (IoT) device operates and lives throughout its life cycle. Despite its complexity, the materialization of these digital artifacts in their simplest form imply the use of a threefold technology: sensors, data acquisition systems (DAS) and graphical user interfaces (GUI). This paper describes several educational exploratory tasks performed at the School of Civil Engineering in Barcelona (UPC) aimed at developing meaningful yet simple digital twins for civil engineering classrooms. The project encompasses the use of simple GUIs that show in real time physical systems from several disciplines such as structural engineering, soils mechanics, hydraulics, environmental engineering, coastal engineering or structural dynamics. The project has shown potential for civil engineering classrooms at two levels: i) these portable tools can be used pedagogically for demonstrating key concepts with a high degree of interactivity, ii) the development of these artifacts (from sensors to GUIs) may provide a key understanding of several concepts associated with IoT mechanics for civil engineering students. It is noteworthy that nowadays, average students are seldom acquainted with sensors, electronics and virtualization of physical magnitudes at Bachelor and Master level. IoT technologies will be needed in civil engineering classrooms in the following years due to the increasing trends related to automation, monitoring and digitalization that the construction industry will undertake. Experimental and numerical pedagogical activities may be enriched with this concept since they allow navigating from physical to virtual realms and vice versa.

The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107992986

The Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry lags a bit in adopting it because of its multi‐faceted dependencies and unique nature of work. Despite this, a trend has been seen recently to hone the IR 4.0 multitudes in the AEC industry. The upsurge has been seen in the usage of Immersive Technologies (ImTs) as one of the disruptive techniques. This paper studies the literature based on ImTs, which are Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) integrating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the AEC sector. A total number of 444 articles were selected from Scopus following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis (PRISMA) protocol of reviewing the literature. Among the selected database, 64 papers are identified as the result of following the protocol, and the articles are divided into eight domains relevant to the AEC indus-try, namely client/stakeholder, design exploration, design analysis, construction planning, construction monitoring, construction health/safety, facility/management, and education/training. This study adopts both a scientometric analysis for bibliometrics visualization and a critical review using Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analysis for finding gaps and state of play. The novelty of this paper lies in the analysis techniques used in the literature to provide an insight into the literature, and it provides directions for the future with an emphasis on developing sustainable development goals (SDGs). In addition, research directions for the future growth on the adoption of ImTs are identified and presented based on categorization in immersive devices, graphical/non-graphical data and, responsive/integrative processes. In addition, five subcategories for each direc-tion are listed, citing the limitations and future/needs. This study presents the roadmap for the suc-cessful adoption of ImTs for industry practitioners and stakeholders in the AEC industry for various domains. The paper shows that there are studies on ImTs with or without BIM; however, future studies should focus on the usage of ImTs in various sectors such as modular integrated construction (MiC) or emerging needs such as SDGs. © 2021 by the authors.

These spaces give students and instructors access to advanced design technology and facilitate the incorporation of a wide variety of projects into the curriculum; however, their impacts on students are not yet fully understood. Using matched survey responses (i.e., repeated measures) from undergraduate students enrolled in engineering courses that assigned a makerspace-based project, we evaluate how the use of a university makerspace impacts students’ attitudes towards design, engineering, and technology. Further, we examine whether there are differences based on students’ year in program, gender, and race. Results: Paired t-tests were used to analyze whether and how nine factors changed within individual students over one semester. Analyses revealed that students who visited the facility showed significant gains in measures of innovation orientation, design self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, belonging to the makerspace, and belonging to the engineering community. Subsequently, repeated measures analyses of variance (RMANOVAs) on the students who visited the makerspace revealed significant main effects of students’ year in program, gender, and race, as well as interactional effects of both year in program and race with time. Conclusions: These results affirm the value of incorporating makerspace-based projects into STEM curricula, especially during early coursework. However, our analyses revealed consistent gender gaps in measures of self-efficacy before and after using the makerspace. Similarly, gains in belonging to the makerspace were not equal across racial groups. We conclude that while makerspaces are fulfilling some of their promise for educating innovative problem solvers, more attention needs to be paid to avoid reproducing disparities in STEM education that are already experienced by female students and racial minorities. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103896120

Training simulation software for automatic systems, process optimization, and system validation are a must-have for all production centers to do faster machine integrations and more rapid prototyping to find advantages over their competitors. The new form of system validation is known as virtual commissioning, which emulates a real industrial environment thanks to computer software, and it provides the user with a safe place to train before dealing with a problem in the real world. This technology represents an opportunity for specialized education where virtual commissioning could be used to equip control and automation laboratories in which students and trainees in automation can test, validate, and debug their control and automation strategies. Thus, the student learns by doing; the technology saves the training center money by not needing costly, industrial machinery to reinforce student understanding. The student’s practice becomes a regular habit. In our global economy, many developing nations whose primary economic activity is production feel these pressures, but their training laboratories are resource-poor and are commonly equipped with improvised homemade systems that do not represent what students will face in the real industrial environment. This article describes the creation process, capabilities, and scope of a set of new virtual commissioning elements within Cyber-Physical Laboratories (CPL). A CPL is a merger of physical laboratories equipped with real industrial controllers and virtual environments to emulate industrial processes which can be used for engineering training in automation, control, and robotics for the purpose of achieving low costs and effective use of laboratories. As in a physical system, in a Cyber-Physical Laboratory, devices are totally connected, all operating in their own spaces, real and virtual, and interacting with each other. This research paper also shows examples of in situ Cyber-Physical Laboratories and their capabilities, scope, usage, and contributions to student training. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090976693

This study aims to determine the issues encountered in topographical survey education that could be mitigated by 3D-printed models and to explore the effectiveness of hands-on 3D-printing exercises in real teaching practices by guiding students to design and fabricate 3D models using 3D-printing techniques. A mixed method combining quantitative and qualitative approaches has been employed including experiments and structured interview surveys. The qualitative ethnographic method through a qualitative experiment developed 3D-printed models for topographic education. Topographic maps were developed using Sketchup Version 8 software in order to fabricate the 3D topographic models. Hands-on 3D-printing exercises engender better understanding and appreciation of topographic maps among the students. This research demonstrates how 3D models could complement the conventional teaching using 2D maps in university education. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056632606

One potential area of importance is that of infrastructure rehabilitation. Since civil engineers play an important role in construction and infrastructure rehabilitation, teaching construction automation and robotics to civil engineering students has become a contemporary issue over the past eight to 10 years. The objective of this paper is to explore the issue of whether dedicated, in-depth courses in construction automation are required or whether it is better to treat the subject with a breadth approach and as part of other construction engineering courses. This paper includes results of a review of current literature, responses from colleagues pursuing the subject, and alternative methods of incorporating construction automation and robotics topics into civil engineering curricula.

Our research questions focus on the kinds of knowledge that students value, use, and identify within an interdisciplinary digital media program, as well as how they talk about using these epistemologies while navigating this transdisciplinary intersection. Six interviews were conducted with students pursuing a semester-long senior capstone project in the digital culture undergraduate degree program in the School of Arts, Media and Engineering at Arizona State University that emphasizes the intersection between arts, media, and engineering. Results: Using deductive coding followed by discourse analysis, a variety of student epistemologies including positivism, constructionism, and pragmatism were observed. “Border epistemologies” are introduced as a way to think and/or construct knowledge with differing value across disciplines. Further, discourse analysis highlighted students’ identifications with being either an artist or an engineer and revealed linguistic choice in how students use knowledge and problem-solve in these situations. Conclusions: Students in a digital media program use fluid, changing epistemological viewpoints when working on their projects, partly driven by orientations with arts and/or engineering. The findings from this study can lead to implications for the design and teaching of transdisciplinary capstones in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104310645

A set of technological approaches, called Industry 4.0, appeared about 10 years ago. The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future. The system of engineering education is based on the principles of individualization of educational and professional paths, practical orientation, development of soft skills, mobility. Personal education path - it's not just a student's choice, but it's very labor-intensive, properly designed work of educational institution, where not only the whole university is engaged, but also its partner employers.The Moscow Aviation Institute is implementing the integrated concept of personalization. The peculiarity of individual learning path at the university is that at the first stage of its formation the potential direction and place of professional activity are determined, the necessary competencies to be acquired are accounted, and an individual development plan is formed. The holders of the typical student paths at Moscow Aviation Institute are the internal employer-divisions - Competency Centers, which have become the integrators of forward-looking technologies and are conducting a large number of projects commissioned by the industry. Also, the MAI Competence Centers help students to form the path to the professions in demand in the future, providing an opportunity for practice and mastering additional engineering, technological and managerial competences.Students comprehend their personal learning pathways at three levels. First at the level of the educational program through the identification of elective courses and places of practice after consultation with the tutor. Second, at the academic level, they master the chapters and topics that are the most relevant to student's current or future professional activity. Finally, a committed student can use internships, hackathons, Academic exchange and many other ways to form a unique path, outside the formal learning process.At the same time, an important task is the formation of healthy competition between students in obtaining access to certain modules of individual path. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098596691
