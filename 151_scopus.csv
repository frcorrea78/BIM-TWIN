BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619234

Rapid project assessment further identifies discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned progress, and facilitates decision making on the necessary remedial actions. Currently, manual visual observations and surveying are the most dominant data capturing techniques but they are time-consuming, error-prone, and infrequent, making quick and reliable decision-making difficult. Therefore, research on new approaches that allow automatic recognition of as-built performance and visualization of construction progress is essential. This paper presents and compares two methods for obtaining point cloud models for detection and visualization of as-built status for construction projects: (1) A new method of automated image-based reconstruction and modeling of the as-built project status using unordered daily construction photo collections through analysis of Structure from Motion (SfM); (2) 3D laser scanning and analysis of the as-built dense point cloud models. These approaches provide robust means for recognition of progress, productivity, and quality on a construction site. In this paper, an overview of the newly developed automated image-based reconstruction approach and exclusive features which distinct it from other image-based or conventional photogrammetric techniques is presented. Subsequently the terrestrial laser scanning approach carried out for reconstruction and comparison of as-built scenes is presented. Finally the accuracy and usability of both of these techniques for metric reconstruction, automated production of point cloud models, 3D CAD shape modeling, and as-built visualizations is evaluated and compared on eight different case studies. It is shown that for precise defect detection or alignment tasks, image-based point cloud models may not be as accurate and dense as laser scanners' point cloud models. Nonetheless image-based point cloud models provide an opportunity to extract as-built semantic information (i.e., progress, productivity, quality and safety) through the content of the images, are easy to use, and do not need add burden on the project management teams by requiring expertise for data collection or analysis. Finally image-based reconstruction automatically provides photo alignment with point cloud models and enables image-based renderings which can remarkably impact automated performance monitoring and as-built visualizations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When comparing modeling time per object, rates ranged from 0.2 (decreased modeling time) to 1.56 (increased modeling time). Based on the experiments done in MEP design coordination, it was observed that the automatic clash detection process using BIMs, with its consistently higher recall rate, provides a more complete identification of clashes, with the cost of false positives (low precision).

As precast concrete based rapid construction is becoming commonplace and standardized in the construction industry, checking the conformity of dimensional and surface qualities of precast concrete elements to the specified tolerances has become ever more important in order to prevent failure during construction. Moreover, as BIM gains popularity due to significant developments in information technology, an autonomous and intelligent quality assessment system that is interoperable with BIM is needed. The current methods for dimensional and surface quality assessment of precast concrete elements, however, rely largely on manual inspection and contact-type measurement devices, which are time demanding and costly. In addition, systematic data storage and delivery systems for dimensional and surface quality assessment are currently lacking. To overcome the limitations of the current methods for dimensional and surface quality assessment of precast concrete elements, this study aims to establish an end-to-end framework for dimensional and surface quality assessment of precast concrete elements based on BIM and 3D laser scanning. The proposed framework is composed of four parts: (1) the inspection checklists; (2) the inspection procedure; (3) the selection of an optimal scanner and scan parameters; and (4) the inspection data storage and delivery method. In order to investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework, case studies assessing the dimensional and surface qualities of actual precast concretes are conducted. The results of the case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach using BIM and 3D laser scanning has the potential to produce an automated and reliable dimensional and surface quality assessment for precast concrete elements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These documents are constantly being created and modified throughout the life of a project. This process is usually manual and fraught with errors, which inhibits reliable decision making. Technological advancements have made it possible to generate 3D models to assess as-built conditions for construction monitoring purposes, such as verifying conformance to baseline project schedules and contract specifications. For this purpose, 3D point clouds are widely generated using laser scanners. However, this approach has limitations in the construction industry due to expensive and fragile equipments, lack of portability and need of trained operators. This study aims at investigating an alternate technology to generate as-built 3D point clouds using photos taken using handheld digital cameras, compare them against the original as-built 3D models, and check for accuracy of the modeling process. This analysis can aid in a more reliable and effective decision making due to its cost effectiveness and ease of use, particularly in heavy infrastructure projects which are continually undergoing rehabilitation work. To achieve these objectives, a set of guidelines are developed for taking photographs that enable effective generation of 3D point clouds using off-the-shelf software packages. The accuracy of the modeling process is investigated using the results of the as-built 3D point cloud modeling of a 2000 ft under construction bridge in southern United States. Finally, the range of tolerance and deviation of element dimensions is determined by comparing the photo based model to the actual as-built model (developed using 2D drawings). Furthermore, to compare point clouds generated from laser scanning and photogrammetry, a laser scan and an image based survey of an exterior wall of a university building were also done. Results show that this technology in its present state is not suitable for modeling infrastructure projects, however technological developments can enable this to be an efficient way to extract measurements of inaccessible objects for progress monitoring purposes and the models can also be stored for future dimension takeoffs for decision making and asset management purposes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nondestructive evaluation techniques, such as digital image processing, are innovative approaches for structural health monitoring. Current structure inspection standards require an inspector to travel to the structure site and visually assess the structure conditions. A less time consuming and inexpensive alternative to current monitoring methods is to use a robotic system that could inspect structures more frequently. Among several possible techniques is the use of optical instrumentation (e.g. digital cameras) that relies on image processing. The feasibility of using image processing techniques to detect deterioration in structures has been acknowledged by leading experts in the field. A survey and evaluation of relevant studies that appear promising and practical for this purpose is presented in this study. Several image processing techniques, including enhancement, noise removal, registration, edge detection, line detection, morphological functions, colour analysis, texture detection, wavelet transform, segmentation, clustering and pattern recognition, are key pieces that could be merged to solve this problem. Missing or deformed structural members, cracks and corrosion are main deterioration measures that are found in structures, and they are the main examples of structural deterioration considered here. This paper provides a survey and an evaluation of some of the promising vision-based approaches for automatic detection of missing (deformed) structural members, cracks and corrosion in civil infrastructure systems.

Starting with a point cloud of a scene - generated using laser scanners or image-based reconstruction methods - the user must first identify collections of points that belong to individual surfaces, and then, fit surfaces and solid geometry objects appropriate for the analysis. When performed manually, this task is often prohibitively time consuming and, in response, several research groups have recently focused on developing methods for automating the modeling process. Due to the limitations of the data collection processes as well as the complexity of as-built scenes, automated 3D modeling still presents many challenges. To overcome existing limitations, in this paper, we propose a new region growing method for robust context-free segmentation of unordered point clouds based on geometrical continuities. In our method, the user sets a single parameter which accounts for the desired level of abstraction. We treat this parameter as a locally adaptive threshold to account for local context. Our method of segmentation starts with a multi-scale feature detection, describing surface roughness and curvature around each 3D point, and is followed by seed finding and region growing steps. Experimental results from seven challenging point clouds of the built environment demonstrate that our method can account for variability in point cloud density, surface roughness, curvature, and clutter within a single scene. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In today's construction industry, there is an increasing demand for modularization of prefabricated components and control of their dimensional quality during the fabrication and assembly stages. To meet these needs, this study develops a non-contact dimensional quality assurance (DQA) technique that automatically and precisely assesses the key quality criteria of full-scale precast concrete elements. First, a new coordinate transformation algorithm is developed taking into account the scales and complexities of real precast slabs so that the DQA technique can be fully automated. Second, a geometry matching method based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which relates the as-built model constructed from the point cloud data to the corresponding as-designed BIM model, is utilized for precise dimension estimations of the actual precast slab. Third, an edge and corner extraction algorithm is advanced to tackle issues encountered in unexpected conditions, i.e. large incident angles and external steel bars being located near the edge of precast concrete elements. Lastly, a BIM-assisted storage and delivery approach for the obtained DQA data is proposed so that all relevant project stakeholders can share and update DQA data through the manufacture and assembly stages of the project. The applicability of the proposed DQA technique is validated through field tests on two full-scale precast slabs, and the associated implementation issues are discussed.

This paper presents an analytical and quantitative comparison of photogrammetric, videogrammetric, and time-of-flight-based methods. This comparison is done with respect to accuracy, quality, time efficiency, and cost. To this end, representative image-based three-dimensional reconstruction software and commercially available hardware (two cameras and a time-of-flight-based laser scanner) are evaluated.

The experimental parameters include camera type, resolution, and shooting distance for the imaging sensors.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902439119

However, laser scanned data contains inaccurate data points at spatial discontinuities (object edges). These inaccurate points, known as mixed-pixels, are commonly removed from the data prior to geometric modeling or other downstream processes. The removal of points at the edges of objects introduces error in the geometry of the objects, and object dimensions extracted from the data, such as widths and heights, are usually smaller than the actual values. In many cases, these losses due to removal of points at edges can exceed measurement accuracy tolerances specified in inspection manuals. This paper proposes a model for estimating edge loss in laser scanned data by considering the impacts of various factors, such as scanning distance, density of data and incidence angle on the edge loss. Results from a series of controlled experiments showed that the developed model successfully predicted edge losses in most test cases. Evaluation results using data collected from job sites showed that this model reduced the measurement error due to edge loss by an average of 80% for dense point clouds collected by an amplitude modulated continuous wave (AMCW) scanner, and 38% for relatively sparse point clouds collected by a pulsed time of flight (PTOF) scanner.

Developments of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) offer great opportunities to achieve a leap forward in the efficiency and completeness of dimensional control operations. This paper presents an approach that demonstrates the value of this integration for surface flatness control. The approach employs the Scan-vs-BIM principle of Bosché and Haas (2008) to segment TLS point clouds acquired on-site, by matching each point to the corresponding object in the BIM model. The novel approach then automatically applies two different standard flatness control techniques, Straightedge and F-Numbers, to the TLS points associated to each floor, and concludes with regard to their compliance with given tolerances. The approach is tested and validated using data from two actual concrete slabs. Results confirm the suitability of using TLS for conducting standard dimensional controls, and validate the performance of our system when compared to traditional measurement methods (in terms of both quality and efficiency). Furthermore, a novel straightedge generation method is proposed and demonstrated that enables more complete and homogeneous analysis of floor flatness for insignificant additional processing times. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900462381

The development of a means for automated assessment employing digital image processing offers high potential for practical implementation. However, two problems in two-dimensional (2D) image processing hinder direct application for crack assessment, as follows: (1) the image used for the digital image processing has to be taken perpendicular to the surface of the concrete structure, and (2) the working distance used in retrieving the imaging model has to be measured each time. To address these problems, this paper proposes a combination of 2D image processing and three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction to locate the 3D position of crack edges. In the proposed algorithm, first the precise crack information is obtained from the 2D images after noise elimination and crack detection using image processing techniques. Then, 3D reconstruction is conducted employing several crack images to build the 3D scene, and the surfaces in the scene are estimated by plane fitting using the 3D point cloud. Subsequently, the crack is projected from the 2D image onto the 3D concrete surface with a crack so that the precise 3D coordinates of the crack edges are found. The final crack assessment results are given using the scaled 3D crack information.

The presented research designed and implemented algorithms that address these challenges and enable autonomous robotic assembly of freeform modular structures on construction sites. Building on the authors' previous work in computer-vision-based pose estimation, the designed algorithms enable a mobile robotic manipulator to: 1) autonomously identify and grasp prismatic building components (e.g., bricks, blocks) that are typically non-unique and arbitrarily stored on-site; and 2) assemble these components into pre-designed modular structures.

This approach often leads to site-fit rework and increase in project risk, since dimensional and geometric variability is more problematic in modular construction than stick-built construction due to module interfacing and erection on site. To address this persistent challenge within modular construction, this article presents a framework for an optimal design of dimensional and geometric variability through the use of comprehensive tolerance strategies by minimizing both fabrication costs and project risks. A methodology for developing tolerance strategies in modular construction is introduced and demonstrated using a case study on an industrial pipe chassis module. The proposed methodology links a structural analysis framework which aims to predict the performance of various assembly configurations to construction costs and various types of project risks. While structural analysis techniques mainly aim to predict failure modes and mechanisms of assemblies, this research aims to further enhance such models by adding risk and cost measures to the structural analysis models. This methodology aims to manage dimensional and geometric variability by the goal of reducing rework and decreasing project costs by providing a set of Pareto-optimal design solutions ranging from strict to lose tolerance control with respect to an amalgamated cost for module production and project risk. This allows the stakeholders, engineers and construction managers to better understand the trade-offs between fabrication costs and alignment, rework, safety, and transportation risks (in terms of cost) of modules, and therefore enhance the planning and design phases of modular construction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009253800

Therefore, non-contact sensing technologies have been widely deployed for more efficient and accurate geometric QA. While a large number of techniques and algorithms have been developed in previous studies for non-contact sensing-based geometric QA, relatively little work has been done to systematically study and review their performance.

However, any abnormalities in precast concrete surfaces such as non-flatness or distortion, can influence the erection of the elements as well as the functional performance of the connections between elements. Thus, it is important to undertake surface flatness and distortion inspection (SFDI) on precast concrete elements before their delivery to the construction sites. The traditional methods of SFDI which are conducted manually or by contact-type devices are, however, time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone. To tackle these problems, this study proposes techniques for SFDI of precast concrete elements using laser scanning technology. The proposed techniques estimate the FF number to evaluate the surface flatness, and estimate three different measurements, warping, bowing, and differential elevation between adjacent elements, to evaluate the surface distortion. The proposed techniques were validated by experiments on four small scale test specimens manufactured by a 3D printer. The measured surface flatness and distortion from the laser scanned data were compared to the actual ones, which were obtained from the designed surface geometries of the specimens.

Despite complete interchangeability-based design, geometric variability resulting from production processes creates variances between the as-built states of identical components. This inevitable occurrence of discrepancies between design and fabrication creates challenges for component aggregation on site and causes rework during assembly and erection. This paper presents a framework for optimally planning the order and arrangement of components such that the impacts of geometric variability, and the rework it can cause are minimized. The proposed framework compares the critical interface points of components in order to optimize the assembly plan in two distinct approaches: (1) minimization of the overall assembly geometric deviation, and (2) avoidance of rework caused by component aggregation. The proposed framework can be carried out for serial-parallel assemblies and for volumetric assemblies utilizing the as-built state in the form of three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data. The results of the two case studies in this paper demonstrate that not only can the assembly plan of interchangeable components be optimized to reduce the impacts of geometric variability, but geometric deviations can also be quantified, which is of vital importance for proper construction planning. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009237736

By borrowing concepts from robotic kinematics and 3D image alignment theories, forward kinematics models are generated link by link, and thus provide the means for a local discrepancy analysis for quantifying the deviations autonomously.

Both mechanistic and statistical approaches to correcting position errors are possible. A statistical approach is reported here that is validated based on experiments with a computer-controlled large-scale manipulator (LSM). The LSM is sufficiently representative of several types of construction equipment to be able to serve as a general test bed. In the regression analysis, three factors which are measurable in real time: distance, hydraulic pressure, and payload, were varied to determine their influence on position errors in the LSM.

For example, precast bridge deck slabs are placed on precast girders, and they are connected by shear pockets on deck slabs and shear connectors on girders. For the coupling of deck slabs and girders, it is important to ensure proper connections between shear pockets and shear connectors. However, shear pockets and shear connectors often do not match properly at construction sites because of dimensional errors and misalignments. Furthermore, precast girders deform over time due to their heavy weights, time dependent creep and shrinkage, pre- or post-tensioning, etc., once they are placed on sites. To match these components at construction sites, workers often need to trim and cut some components, delaying construction processes. To shorten such delay, this study proposes a laser scanning and signal processing technique that can automatically identify the optimal placement of precast bridge deck slabs with respect to precast girders by minimizing mismatches between shear pockets and shear connectors. First, scan data from precast bridge deck slabs and precast girders are acquired using a 3D laser scanner, and their dimensions are estimated including the locations and dimensions of shear pockets using DBSCAN and mixed pixel filtering algorithms. Next, locations of the shear connectors are extracted from the scan data of the precast girders using RANSAC and K-means clustering algorithms. Finally, the optimal placement of the deck slabs with respect to the girders is determined by solving a nonlinear minimization problem considering the locations and sizes of the extracted precast components. To validate the performance of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on small-scale test specimens and at an actual construction field. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique could effectively estimate the optimal placement of precast bridge deck slabs with respect to precast girders. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033365450

In addition to the calculation of a realignment strategy, feasible applications of such a strategy are also investigated in this paper. The framework for realigning parallel systems has two primary steps: (1) as-built status identification by capturing the geometric state of construction assemblies using three-dimensional (3D) imaging theories, and (2) realignment calculation and actuation based on degrees of freedom (DOFs) defined during the development of the kinematics chains of assemblies. A Quasi-Newton-Raphson (QNR) method is employed for solving the kinematics equation of the inverse kinematics analogy.

This study develops a mixed pixel filter for improved dimension estimation using AMCW laser scanners. The distance measurement of mixed pixels is firstly formulated based on the working principle of laser scanners. Then, a mixed pixel filter that can minimize the classification errors between valid points and mixed pixels is developed. Validation experiments were conducted to verify the formulation of the distance measurement of mixed pixels and to examine the performance of the proposed mixed pixel filter. Experimental results show that, for a specimen with dimensions of 840 mm × 300 mm, the overall errors of the dimensions estimated after applying the proposed filter are 1.9 mm and 1.0 mm for two different scanning resolutions, respectively.

The governing dynamic equations for such systems are differential-algebraic in nature-that is, they consist of a set of ordinary differential equations coupled with a set of nonlinear algebraic constraint equations-and can be difficult to solve in real time. In this work, the equations of motion are formulated symbolically using linear graph theory. The embedding technique is applied to eliminate the Lagrange multipliers from the dynamic equations and obtain one ordinary differential equation for each independent acceleration. The theory of Gröbner bases is then used to triangularize the kinematic constraint equations, thereby producing a recursively solvable system for calculating the dependent generalized coordinates given values of the independent coordinates.
