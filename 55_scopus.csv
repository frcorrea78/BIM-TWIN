However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019987476

Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O&M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O&M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O&M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O&M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O&M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O&M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060496584

In fact, the information related to the O&M management of the MEP system conventionally comes from the completion documents in the forms of hard copies or unstructured digital files, making it hard to search for useful information in the “sea” of documents and drawings. Therefore, digitalization of information is an urgent task to facilitate the intelligent management of the MEP system. As a project deliverable, the as-built information model shall not only contain geometrical information and necessary construction-related data, but also built-in information useful for the intelligent O&M management. In the present study, based on the Building Information Modeling/Model (BIM) technology, a set of solutions including the automatic establishment of the logic chain for MEP systems, an equipment grouping and labeling scheme and an algorithm to transform BIM information to GIS map model, is proposed to digitalize and integrate the MEP-related information into the as-built model. Subsequently, a cross-platform O&M management system is developed using the MEP-related information in the as-built model to run routine O&M tasks and to effectively response to MEP-related emergencies.

These accumulated data have the potential to provide deep information that can help improve facility management. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

However, it is challenging to carry out analytics on these large and amorphous databases. This paper puts forward a text-mining method to extract information about failure patterns in building systems and components from CMMS databases. The method is executed in three steps. Step 1 is pre-processing to convert work order descriptions into a mathematical form that lends itself to a quantitative lexical analysis. Step 2 is clustering to focus on interesting sections of a CMMS database that contain work orders about failures in building systems and components–rather than less interesting routine maintenance and inspection activities. Step 3 is association rule-mining to identify the coexistence tendencies among the terms of cluster of interest (e.g. coexistence of the terms ‘radiator’ and ‘leak’). This text-mining method is demonstrated by using two data sets. One data set was from a central heating and cooling plant with four boilers and five chillers; the other data set was from a cluster of 44 buildings.

In this study, a dynamic path planning approach based on neural networks is proposed for evacuation planning in large public buildings. First, an automatic process to develop the evacuation analysis model with simplified but sufficient information is presented. Then a path generation algorithm is proposed, together with an evaluation process, to generate a number of training sets for policy neural networks. When the primary policy neural network is preliminarily trained, it falls into a self-learning iteration process. Finally, the approach embeds a dynamic algorithm to simulate the mutual influences among all occupants in the building. The neural network was trained according to a real large public building and then the approach managed to provide rapid and feasible evacuation guidance for both occupants to escape in multiple scenarios and managers to design the evacuation strategy.

The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for FM in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages of the building lifecycle is intended to bridge the gap between operations and digital data, but lacks the functionality of assessing and forecasting the state of the built environment in real-time. To accommodate this, BIM data needs to be constantly updated with the current state of the built environment. However, generation of as-is BIM data for a digital representation of a building is a labor intensive process. While some software applications offer a degree of automation for the generation of as-is BIM data, they can be impractical to use for routinely updating digital FM documentation. Current approaches for capturing the built environment using remote sensing and photometry-based methods allow for the creation of 3D point clouds that can be used as basis data for a Digital Twin (DT), along with existing BIM and FM documentation. 3D point clouds themselves do not contain any semantics or specific information about the building components they represent physically, but using machine learning methods they can be enhanced with semantics that would allow for reconstruction of as-is BIM and basis DT data.

A specific focus is placed on the reconstruction and visualization of the captured state of the built environment for increasing FM stakeholder engagement and facilitating collaboration.

The concept of seismic resilience pays enough attention to postearthquake functionality of buildings, and it is particularly significant for the urban hospitals which play critical role in the urban postearthquake rescue and recovery. This study proposes a framework to assess the seismic resilience of urban hospitals, by incorporating the fault tree analysis (FTA) to consider the interdependency between the damage of nonstructural components and the functionality of medical equipment, as well as the effect of external supplies on the functionality of hospital. The proposed framework is then applied to a case-study hospital, and the results indicate that this hospital needs 1.1 days to resume emergency functionality under REDi repair strategy after design basis earthquake (DBE), while it needs 28.8 days to resume emergency functionality under REDi repair strategy after maximum considered earthquake (MCE). It is found that the seismic resilience of this hospital after MCE cannot meet the community requirements on the recovery time, and necessary measures are needed to improve the seismic resilience. The proposed framework provides the quantitative results of seismic resilience assessment in the preearthquake environment and can further support emergency response planning and seismic retrofits strategies. © 2019 Peng Yu et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068041797

However, due to the existence of hidden dangers in construction, accidents at the construction site still plague the development of the construction industry. Therefore, effective management of construction hazards is an important step to strengthen construction safety. At present, the technology of BIM has been gradually applied to various fields of construction projects, providing strong support for the smooth development of construction projects. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to create a construction hazard source safety management module through secondary development of the Revit platform. At the same time, the Navisworks software is used to simulate the emergency rescue of construction safety accidents and formulate the corresponding emergency management plan. Finally, an engineering example is used to verify the performance of the development management module. The results show that (1) the security management module created in this paper is highly operational, easy to use, and real-time data update, which has important guiding significance for actual construction safety management; (2) simulation of construction safety accidents through Navisworks software can provide emergency management plans for engineering projects. © 2019 Langni Deng et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077520813

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082879525
