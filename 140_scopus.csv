Then we propose a smart city infrastructure which is based on digital city, the Internet of Things (IOT) and cloud computing technologies. Smart city will achieve comprehensive awareness and management of people and things to provide various intelligent services. Smart city with mass sensors will continuously collect vast amounts of data. Big data in smart city also bring many problems and challenges. To deal with those big data-related issues, we propose a strategy mainly base on the cloud computing and data mining. After that, we presente a framework for cloud platform and propose the suggestion of establish smart city operation center. In the end, we look forward to a bright future for the smart city.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903434858

Currently, 3D GIS perspective carriers are mainly 2D and not 3D, which influences how 3D information is expressed and further affects the user cognition and understanding of 3D information. Using mixed reality as a carrier of 3D GIS is promising and may overcome problems when using 2D perspective carriers in 3D GIS. The objective of this paper is to propose an architecture and method to leverage the Microsoft HoloLens in 3D geographic information (Holo3DGIS). The architecture is designed according to three processes for developing holographic 3D GIS; the three processes are the creation of a 3D asset, the development of a Holo3DGIS application, and the compiler deployment of the Holo3DGIS application. Basic geographic data of Philadelphia were used to test the proposed methods and Holo3DGIS. The experimental results showed that the Holo3DGIS can leverage 3D geographic information with the Microsoft HoloLens. By changing the traditional 3D geographic information carrier from a 2D computer screen perspective to mixed reality glasses using the HoloLens 3D holographic perspective, it changed the traditional vision, body sense, and interaction modes, which enables GIS users to experience real 3D GIS. © 2018 by the authors.

In the era of big data, it is urgent to enhance the timeliness and intelligence level of the geo-spatial information science.Artificial intelligence is applied to geo-spatial information science, enhancing the perception and cognition ability of geospatial information processing, and realizing the three processes of perception, cognition and action of geo-spatial information science.Through the integration of geo-spatial big data and AI (artificial intelligence), the macro, meso and micro scale of the earth space, earth observation brain(EOB), smart city brain(SCB) and smart phone brain(SPB) are proposed. EOB, SCB and SPB are highly intelligent systems in the geo-spatial information science. The concept model and the key technologies needed to be solved of EOB, SCB and SPB are introduced in detail, and an example is given to illustrate the process of perception, cognition and active in the primary stage of the EOB,SCB and SPB. In future,EOB,SCB and SPB can observe when, where, what object, what change to push these right information to right person at the right time and right place. © 2018, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.
