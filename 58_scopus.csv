This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029313621

This paper introduces an environment aware beacon deployment algorithm designed by the authors to support a sequence based localization schema for locating first responders and trapped occupants at building fire emergency scenes. The algorithm is designed to achieve dual objectives of improving room-level localization accuracy and reducing the effort required to deploy an ad-hoc sensor network, as the required sensing infrastructure is presumably unavailable at most emergency scenes. The deployment effort is measured by the number of beacons to deploy, and the location accessibility to deploy the beacons. The proposed algorithm is building information modeling (BIM) centered, where BIM is integrated to provide the geometric information of the sensing area as input to the algorithm for computing space division quality, a metric that measures the likelihood of correct room-level estimations and associated deployment effort. BIM also provides a graphical interface for user interaction. Metaheuristics are integrated to efficiently search for a satisfactory solution in order to reduce the computational time, which is crucial for the success of emergency response operations. The algorithm was evaluated by simulation, where two building fire emergency scenarios were simulated. The tabu search, which employs dynamically generated constraints to guide the search for optimum solutions, was found to be the most efficient among three tuned tested metaheuristics. The algorithm yielded an average room-level accuracy of 87.1% and 32.1% less deployment effort on average compared with random beacon placements. The robustness of the algorithm was also examined as the deployed ad-hoc sensor network is subject to various hazards at emergency scenes. Results showed that the room-level accuracy could remain above 80% when up to 54% of all deployed nodes were damaged. The tradeoff between the space division quality and deployment effort was also examined, which revealed the relationship between the total deployment effort and localization accuracy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and error-prone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) real-time detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards.

From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models.

In Taiwan, the response to an organization of fire prevention and disaster relief as well as evacuation planning and rescue guidance continue to rely primarily on human-provided intelligence. This method makes disaster-response decision-making inherently prone to error due to the inaccuracy, incompleteness, and poor communication of this intelligence.

Ordinarily, in order to check the corrosion, inspectors remove the insulation of pipelines to measure the level of corrosion on each section of pipelines. This procedure may take weeks for a site which distinctly affects the financial aspect of oil and gas companies due to the pause production of its high-value products; therefore, in most cases, inspectors spot-check pipeline corrosion based on their experience. However, because the environments on sites are various, experience-based inspection may not be suitable for every site. On the other hand, even though inspectors want to access more data for better understanding of the site before the site trip, historical data sometimes are lost or scattered which leads to a hard situation for preparation of corrosion inspection. This paper utilises passive RFID sensors, which are smart sensing technologies, to collect site data and then integrate them into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) system. A uniform corrosion model is also adapted from the theories of corrosion to leverage both sensor data and BIM elements' properties. They serve as inputs to calculate the corrosion rate which is the key value of corrosion prediction. Then, the corrosion prediction results are colour-coded on a BIM model which helps inspectors intuitively understand the prediction and prepare for the site inspection.

Findings: The ISM hierarchical model and Matriced’ impacts croised-multiplication applique’ and classment analysis illustrate that the digitalization process and the semantic interoperability possess high driving power and low dependence. These barriers require keen attention to play a significant role in improving resource efficiency and sustainability, and absence of these barriers may not drive other barriers for CE.

Building protocol includes monitoring safety, security, and verification of maintaining the San Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development hiring mandate. Hardware components include passive RFID tags, portal RFID readers, fixed turn-style readers, and mobile handheld devices, and a cloud server. The system was deployed on a 900,000 square feet hospital project that consisted of three major buildings, 125 contractors, and 1,200 workers. An algorithm is presented that reduces and organizes the data that the system produces. Linking RFID into industry foundation classes (IFC) has been highlighted. Preliminary results show that the integration of these technologies produces data that is used in real-time resource tracking, data analysis, ordinance compliance, and zone safety violations. Additionally, the system also provided real-time visualization information that can provide a variety of benefits. Significantly, based on experimental analysis, we demonstrate that the RFID and BIM system is a practical and resourceful tool to provide real-time information and location tracking to maintain building protocol control.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979519376

In buildings, structural members are often hidden behind drywalls, and thus buckling or yielding in steel members are difficult to detect, often requiring removal of coverings and thus time consuming and costly. Fast and accurate assessment of structural conditions is important to the occupant safety and uninterrupted use after extreme load events such as strong earthquakes. BIM can integrate all types of structural and condition assessment information collected in the life cycle of civil structures and also provides the visual data displaying mechanism that makes the structural health monitoring information easily understandable and actionable. Breakage-triggered (BT) strain sensor that uses RFID tag for non-contact scanning of structural deformation condition has been developed to detect the surpass of pre-set strain threshold corresponding to structural damage conditions such as yielding or buckling. This system can rapidly identify the spot where the pre-set strain threshold has been surpassed and the corresponding structural element in the BIM model would be highlighted to provide alert signal to engineers and decision makers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As of 2013, for example, there were over 13,000 green buildings certified with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) in the United States alone. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and computer simulations are adopted largely for green building design. However, while information sharing and automated, collaborative design review are important for the design of green buildings, the current way of BIM-based green building design relies mainly on individual file transfer and does not support collaboration in the distributed environment of construction projects. On the other hand, as the Internet becomes ubiquitous, the web provides convenient and cost-efficient means for multi-location cross-organizational collaboration. Energy analysis and validation against standard building codes are two major processes in green building design evaluation. This paper presents a modular web service based framework which integrates the information necessary for green building design, automates the building design evaluation processes, and facilitates simple updates on the building model on a common but distributed platform. This framework is based on BIM data models like gbXML (Green Building XML) which contain information for green building design like geometry of the building, material, and sensor information from more than one source. The BIM data models act as a single source of building information for all processes. Building design evaluation and updating are iterative in green building design and require information and inputs dispersed among various project participants. Since our framework follows a distributed architecture and is easily accessible from the Internet, it makes the information required to facilitate the iterative process and its results conveniently available to a multi-participant environment. The paper also presents an example scenario demonstrating the developed framework. © 2014 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907376890

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value.

Hence, effective disaster prevention and rescue are crucial to the protection of life and property. Specifically, firefighting is essential for public safety and building safety. Rescue maps that are currently used in fire departments are two-dimensional (2D) because fire accidents have mostly occurred in low-rise buildings. Therefore, fire incident commanders have previously only had typical fire rescue maps to use for firefighter deployment. Such 2D-based firefighting strategies, tactics, and deployment are not always effective in current structures, and do not inform whether occupants are trapped during a fire. Consequently, fire rescue teams continue to consult maps on different floors when conducting fire rescue tasks, reducing their speed and efficiency. An intelligent integrated fire rescue system could provide real-time status updates, alarm reports, and evacuation guidance, improving fire rescue techniques through a combination of contemporary autosensing and communication systems. To achieve the aim, this work combines existing firefighting equipment, Bluetooth sensors, global positioning information, an optimal fire rescue path-planning algorithm, and visual technology to construct a framework of dynamic rescue/evacuation procedures for fire departments.

The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation.

Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office.

To this end, numerous eco-feedback systems have been developed to reduce building energy use through influencing occupants' behaviors during building operations. Information representation is a critical component in eco-feedback systems, affecting the users' interpretation, engagement, and motivation to reduce energy consumption. Many studies have focused on using different charts and technical units or abstract and artistic visualizations to represent energy consumption. However, the effectiveness of such techniques varies across studies. Recent research emphasizes the need to integrate information representation strategies that balance numeric and aesthetic appeal. Concurrently, studies have called for increased adoption of a Building Information Model (BIM) during a building's operations phase to improve facility management. In this paper, we introduce a new eco-feedback information representation method that combines numeric and aesthetic appeal through leveraging spatial and color-coding techniques in BIM. The BIM-integrated energy visualization approach developed in this paper uses the Revit Application Program Interface (API) and allows users to visualize and compare energy consumption values in 2D and 3D views of a multi-family building through a color-coding scheme in an as-built BIM. The method is validated through a user survey that quantitatively and qualitatively assesses the proposed 2D and 3D BIM eco-feedback compared to more traditional bar chart based eco-feedback. Our findings suggest that 2D spatial, color-coded eco-feedback provides the optimal information representation, as it is easy to understand, while evoking engaging and motivating responses from users. This study advances our understanding of eco-feedback information representation while expanding BIM applications during building operations. These are important steps to address the human dimension of energy efficiency in the built environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044962667

From investigation of a prefabricated construction project in Hong Kong, two main problems have been revealed relating to energy consumption, including: (i) inefficient management of resources such as labours and machines, and (ii) inefficient production, transportation, and on-site assembly of prefabricated components. These problems are primarily caused by lagged information communication and human errors. This paper seeks to offer a solution by developing a Physical Internet-enabled Building Information Modelling System (PI-BIMS) that integrates Auto-ID technologies, BIM, and cloud computing. The PI-BIMS enables real-time collection, communication, and visualisation of information across the processes of production, transportation, and on-site assembly. Practical issues of the system implementation are provided through a pilot prototype. It is found that the PI-BIMS helps enhance the resource allocation efficiency and decrease human errors.

The system automatically works out key performance indicators based on the overall throughput effectiveness (OTE) metric, assessing both the overall efficiency and the efficiency of every sub-system integrated in the building. Thus, assessments of the contribution of every sub-system to the operation of the building are performed in real-time.

Current behavior-intervention techniques extensively rely on occupant-specific energy-use information at the workstation level and often ignore shared appliances. It is because an occupant typically has full responsibility for her workstation appliances energy consumption and shares the responsibility of the shared appliances energy consumption. However, understanding energy-use behavior of both workstation and shared appliances is necessary for applying appropriate behavior-intervention techniques. Despite this importance, there is still no practical and scalable method to capture personalized energy-use information of workstation and shared appliances since the conventional methods use plug-in power meters that are extremely expensive and difficult to maintain over long period of time.

Although such construction practices have advantages in terms of cost competitiveness and delivery time, they have many issues related to structural integrity and secondary stresses from vibration during transit and misalignment during installation. Therefore, monitoring the vibration, strain, and deformation of the modules using structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques is important. The primary purpose of this study is to explore building information modeling (BIM) techniques to facilitate effective data management and the representation of sensory components of the SHM system in a building and to render or visualize the damage or distress in building components based on the interpretation of sensor data. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: (1) an automated sensor-based data acquisition and storage module, which extracts sensor data for a structure from a corresponding relational database; and (2) an automated data and damage visualization module, through which sensor data are interpreted to identify damage or anomalies in the structure and the affected building components are highlighted and tagged in the BIM of the building to facilitate visualization. The damaged or near-damaged elements of the modules are highlighted in the BIM model through color-coding based on predefined threshold strain values. Because detecting buckled or yielded steel members (local damages) in a building or a module is challenging given that these components are often hidden behind fireproof coating and drywall, the proposed SHM-based condition assessment system will contribute - especially in the preinstallation and operational phases - to providing efficient, near-real-time health monitoring of buildings and increasing the efficiency of the structural condition assessment process. These benefits could be particularly useful for modular buildings, for which the modules are constructed in a plant and transported to the site for installation. In these stages, a module may undergo hidden or visible damage, the installed sensors are expected to provide a mechanism to assess such damage, and the entire process can be managed through BIM.

Next, communication-related properties and behavior of distributed cyber-physical systems applied for SHM and control are explained, and system components relevant to communication are specified. Then, the metamodel to formally describe cyber-physical systems is proposed and mapped into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open international standard for building information modeling (BIM). Finally, the IFC-based approach is verified using software of the official IFC certification program, and it is validated by BIM-based example modeling of a prototype cyber-physical system, which is physically implemented in the laboratory.

However, user interaction with connected devices suffers from numerous disadvantages such as complex and cumbersome user interfaces, unreliable voice and gesture interfaces, and the requirement for prior knowledge of the environment. This paper presents an intuitive point-and-click framework to control electrical fixtures in a smart built environment. This functionality is enabled by coupling an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based indoor positioning system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to retrieve contextual information of the user with respect to the built environment when the user performs the pointing action. This information is then input into a building information model (BIM)-based virtual environment wherein the appliance of interest to the user is determined. The subsequent clicking action of the user then turns the devices on or off based on its prior state via the IoT infrastructure in the building. Initial prototype testing through a case study yielded promising results that prove the effectiveness of the framework. Apart from the provision of a novel user-interaction mechanism for controlling electrical fixtures, the proposed framework provides a means of extending the utility of building information models (BIM) to the operation phase of a facility and provides a means for its integration with IoT and smart devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060468504

Furthermore, the wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important key technology in Internet of Things (IoT) development.

Recent advances in technologies such as building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks, augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense opportunity to radically improve the way daily O&M is conducted. This paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants’ thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach: The developed system focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O&M activities such as inspection, recording, communication and verification. Findings: Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an example, the case study demonstrates that the O&M management process can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system. Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site. Originality/value: The originality lies in bringing together the advances in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to support the daily O&M management activities. In particular, the paper presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for visualising those assets with related information. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087569841

Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community.

To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis.

Under current practices, self-inspection is totally dependent on the operator's skills, being a process that can be time-consuming and sometimes difficult to achieve. The Intuitive Self-Inspection Techniques using Augmented Reality (INSITER; for construction, refurbishment and maintenance of energy-efficient buildings made of prefabricated components) project aims to develop a software tool to support construction workers in self-inspection processes, with the overall objective of reducing major errors and extra costs. Nevertheless, one of the challenges is the lack of interoperability between the various equipment used to carry out self-inspection. Devices and current tools deployed on-site do not speak the same language, which leads to a lack of communication. Therefore, this paper presents a framework under which the equipment would be able to send information in a common format. For this purpose, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) de-facto standard has been established as a viable data model to represent all the information related to the building project. Along these lines, Building Information Modeling (BIM) information and IFC-compliant databases have been designed for the representation of data coming from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modeling, laser scanning, thermography and sensor networks. Besides the IFC-data repositories, the framework is a multi-layer architecture with the goal of ensuring interoperability and promoting the stakeholders' objectives for self-inspection during the entire construction process. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042473786

Both BIM and IoT are increasingly being used in the construction industry. However, using BIM in conjunction with IoT for sustainability purposes has not received enough attention in construction. In particular, the capability created from the combination of both technologies has not been exploited. There is a growing consensus that the future of construction operation tends to be smart and intelligent, which would be possible by a combination of both information systems and sensors. This investigation aims to find out the recent efforts of utilizing BIM for lean purposes in the last decade by critically reviewing the published literature and identifying dominant clusters of research topics. More specifically, the investigation is further developed by identifying the gaps in the literature to utilize IoT in conjunction with BIM in construction projects to facilitate applying lean techniques in a more efficient way in construction projects. A systematic review method was designed to identify scholarly papers covering both concepts “lean” and “BIM” in construction and possibilities of using IoT. A total of 48 scholarly articles selected from 26 construction journals were carefully reviewed thorough perusal. The key findings were discussed with industry practitioners. The transcriptions were analyzed employing two coding and cluster analysis techniques. The results of the cluster analysis show two main directions, including the recent practice of lean and BIM interactions and issues of lean and BIM adoption. Findings revealed a large synergy between lean and BIM in control interactions and reduction in variations, and surprisingly there are many uncovered areas in this field. The results also show that the capability of IoT is also largely not considered in recent developments. The number of papers covering both lean and BIM is very limited, and there is a large clear gap in understanding synergetic interactions of lean concepts applying in BIM and IoT in specific fields of construction such as sustainable infrastructure projects. © 2020 by the authors.

Originally designed to engineer-out environmental hazards associated with working in a building’s confined spaces (during the construction phase of a building’s life-cycle), this second generation version is expanded upon to use archival records to proactively learn from data generated within a sensor network during the building’s operations and maintenance (O&M) phase of asset management (AM). Design/methodology/approach: An applied research methodological approach adopted used a two-phase process. In phase one, a conceptual model was created to provide a “blueprint map” to integrate BIM, sensor-based networks and data analytics (DA) into one integral system. A literature review provided the basis for the conceptual model’s further development. In phase two, the conceptual model was transposed into the prototype’s development environment as a proof of concept using primary data accrued from a large educational building. Findings: An amalgamation of BIM, historical sensor data accrued and the application of DA demonstrate that CoSMoS provides an opportunity for the facilities management (FM) team to monitor pertinent environmental conditions and human behaviour within buildings that may impact upon occupant/worker safety. Although working in confined spaces is used to demonstrate the inherent potential of CoSMoS, the system could readily be expanded to analyse sensor-based network’s historical data of other areas of building performance, maintenance and safety. Originality/value: This novel prototype has automated safety applications for FM during the asset lifecycle and maintenance phase of a building’s O&M phase of AM.

This wrong perception of BIM and low interest in 3D asset management (AM) is one of the major reasons for the slow adoption by clients in the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. The purpose of this paper is to identify the techniques and strategies of streamlining AM systems for BIM-based integration, and how the information is captured from physical assets towards BIM-based integration for clients to derive value from BIM investments. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study strategy was used to study the strategic implementation process of integrating BIM with AM systems and the business value of BIM in AM by a large asset owner in the UK. Findings: The paper identifies key strategies in the adoption of BIM-based processes by an asset owner, the implementation process, the challenges and the benefits attained. Several barriers were identified as the challenges of adopting BIM-based processes in AM: complexity and cost associated with BIM; irrelevance of 3D geometric data in AM processes; nature of asset ownership structure; managing the asset handover process; managing change within the organisation. Organisations will have to consider the following issues in streaming asset information with BIM: the development for a clear strategy prior to adoption; connecting the strategy to the business goals; and conducting the discovery exercise to identify organisational information needs. Originality/value: The research addresses a significant gap in the development of techniques and strategies for asset owners to streamline BIM with AM systems and derive business value from such integration. The research context is a case study involving a large owner-operator in the UK that has been able to derive value from BIM systems in their AM processes. The key value of the paper is improving asset owners’ understanding of BIM in AM by demonstrating the implementation strategies, linkage to organisational objectives, challenges, value management process and business value of BIM in AM. Another contribution of the paper is improving the understanding of BIM, which is usually viewed as 3D models and that 3D geometric data do not have much value for AM tasks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063338187

Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, bIm can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, bIm is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility management (Fm). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in Fm. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of Fm operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image recognition (Imr), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data. This data has been stored in a bIm model, employed as single reliable source of information for Fm. This integration can enhance maintenance management contracts if the bIm model is coupled with a smart contract. Far from being a comprehensive case study, this research demonstrates how the transition from bIm to the Asset Information model (AIm) and, finally, to the Digital Twin (i.e. a near-real-time digital clone of a physical asset, of its conditions and processes) is desirable because of the outstanding benefits that have already been measured in other industrial sectors by applying the principles of Industry 4.0. © 2019 WIT Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085259636

Although building information modelling (BIM) has enabled a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries, its use in facility management (FM) is still infancy.

Building information modeling (BIM) provides a useful visual model and database that can be used as a repository for all data captured or made during the facility’s life cycle. It can be used for modeling the sensing-based system for data collection, serving as a source of all information for smart objects such as the sensors used for that purpose. Although few studies have been conducted in integrating BIM with sensor-based monitoring system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the communication between FMs and Internet of Things (IoT) companies in cases encountered failed sensors has received the least attention in the technical literature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and develop a BIM-based system architecture for fault detection and alert generation for malfunctioning FM sensors in smart IoT environments during the operational phase of a building to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes an attempt to examine the applicability of BIM for an efficient sensor failure management system in smart IoT environments during the operational phase of a building. For this purpose, a seven-story office building with four typical types of FM-related sensors with all associated parameters was modeled in a commercial BIM platform. An integrated workflow was developed in Dynamo, a visual programming tool, to integrate the associated sensors maintenance-related information to a cloud-based tool to provide a fast and efficient communication platform between the building facility manager and IoT companies for intelligent sensor management. Findings: The information within BIM allows better and more effective decision-making for building facility managers. Integrating building and sensors information within BIM to a cloud-based system can facilitate better communication between the building facility manager and IoT company for an effective IoT system maintenance. Using a developed integrated workflow (including three specifically designed modules) in Dynamo, a visual programming tool, the system was able to automatically extract and send all essential information such as the type of failed sensors as well as their model and location to IoT companies in the event of sensor failure using a cloud database that is effective for the timely maintenance and replacement of sensors. The system developed in this study was implemented, and its capabilities were illustrated through a case study. The use of the developed system can help facility managers in taking timely actions in the event of any sensor failure and/or malfunction to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services. Research limitations/implications: However, there are some limitations in this work which are as follows: while the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using BIM in the maintenance planning of monitoring systems in the building, the developed workflow can be expanded by integrating some type of sensors like an occupancy sensor to the developed workflow to automatically record and identify the number of occupants (visitors) to prioritize the maintenance work; and the developed workflow can be integrated with the sensors’ data and some machine learning techniques to automatically identify the sensors’ malfunction and update the BIM model accordingly. Practical implications: Transferring the related information such as the room location, occupancy status, number of occupants, type and model of the sensor, sensor ID and required action from the BIM model to the cloud would be extremely helpful to the IoT companies to actually visualize workspaces in advance, and to plan for timely and effective decision-making without any physical inspection, and to support maintenance planning decisions, such as prioritizing maintenance works by considering different factors such as the importance of spaces and number of occupancies. The developed framework is also beneficial for preventive maintenance works. The system can be set up according to the maintenance and time-based expiration schedules, automatically sharing alerts with FMs and IoT maintenance contractors in advance about the IoT parts replacement. For effective predictive maintenance planning, machine learning techniques can be integrated into the developed workflow to efficiently predict the future condition of individual IoT components such as data loggers and sensors, etc. as well as MEP components. Originality/value: Lack of detailed visual information about a built facility can be a reason behind the inefficient management of a facility. Detecting and repairing failed sensors at the earliest possible time is critical to ensure the functional continuity of the monitoring systems. On the other hand, the maintenance of large-scale sensor deployments becomes a significant challenge. Despite its importance, few studies have been conducted in integrating BIM with a sensor-based monitoring system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the communication between facility managers and IoT companies in cases encountered failed sensors. In this paper, a cloud-based BIM platform was developed for the maintenance and timely replacement of sensors which are critical to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services in sensor-based FM. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099982845

However, information contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the development of a building DT. © 2020 by the authors.

This behaviour can be influenced by giving then locally tailored context information (energy consumption, temperature, luminosity) and information about the cost of their actions. This paper presents an approach to create personalized local energy consumption predictions in a building using past sensor data, correlated with external conditions to create local context predictions. This prediction is sent in real-time to people's mobile devices in order to influence their behaviour when increasing or decreasing temperature using heating or cooling systems. This information is essential for sustainability actions in shared spaces, where this information can have an important role. Also, the data (temperature) representation in the building information model (BIM) module can help the user understand environment conditions and, together with the user sharing their thermal feelings, can be used to change behaviour. This approach using BIM's representation models allows Things2People interaction to improve energy savings in these shared spaces. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089796523

Despite the internally deployed sensors used for indoor environmental monitoring, the emergency team still needs more accurate emergency response information to quickly complete the repair work in a real-world scenario. This information contains the location of faulty pipes and key equipment and the accessibility of the indoor path. However, the traditional geometric network model (GNM) is less suitable for computing and describing such information. Hence, an indoor network model named the multiutility tunnel data model (MTDM) is proposed in this paper to compensate for the limitations of GNM. The model adds new nodes, edges, and semantic information based on the traditional GNM; therefore, the model can be more effectively applied to emergency response for utility tunnels. This paper also proposes a method for converting the building information model (BIM) to MTDM; consequently, MTDM can be generated automatically and accurately. Finally, this paper proposes an algorithm named emergency response analysis (ERA) to show how MTDM can be used in emergency response, including detection of faulty pipelines and pipe control equipment, and planning repair paths. This paper uses the West Road utility tunnel in Lingang New Town, Pudong District, Shanghai, China, as a practical engineering application. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing the MTDM model to the GNM model. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070536619

Proper management of multi-owned buildings is underpinned by rules related to health, safety, and security of the residents and visitors. Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect information about the livable space has become a significant trend since the introduction of first smart home appliances back in 2000. The question about who owns the IoT generated data and under what terms it can be shared with others is still unclear. IoT devices, such as security camera and occupancy sensors, can provide safety for their owners, while these devices may capture private data from the neighborhood. In fact, the residents are sometimes not aware of regulations that can prevent them from installing and collecting data from shared spaces that could breach other individuals’ privacy. On the other hand, Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides a rich 3D digital data environment to manage the physical, functional, and ownership aspects of buildings over their entire lifecycle. This study aims to propose a methodology to utilize BIM for defining the legal ownership of the IoT generated data. A case study has been used to discuss key challenges related to the ownership of IoT data in a multi-owned building. This study confirmed that BIM environment can facilitate the understanding of legal ownership of IoT datasets and supports the interpretation of who has the entitlement to use the IoT datasets in multi-owned buildings. © 2019 by the authors.

These excavations have the potential to cause safety problems for the operation of the nearby metro. Therefore, to prevent metro tunnel accidents from occurring during the construction process and to ensure the safety of lives and property, it is necessary to establish a risk-based early warning system. During the excavation process, the main methods for preventing accidents in excavations adjacent to existing metro tunnels are manual analyses based on on-site monitoring data. However, these methods make it difficult to enact effective control measures in a timely manner owing to the lag of information processing. However, the trial application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and building information modelling (BIM) for engineering projects provides a new method for solving such problems. This study uses a backpropagation neural network to predict the real-time deformation of the tunnel based on monitoring data from the adjacent construction site. A safety risk assessment model is then established based on the relevant specifications. Through the establishment of an intelligent warning system, the safety risk to the metro tunnel during the construction process can be displayed in a three-dimensional (3D) form using the BIM. The operation results of the ANN-BIM system show that it can effectively present the safety risk to existing metro tunnels in a 3D manner, which can provide managers with rapid and convenient visual information to inform their decision-making. © 2021 Wei Tian et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099920181

Notably, as buildings are becoming taller and more complex, demands on countermeasure to multi disasters, such as earthquake, fire, and flooding, are increasing for complex skyscraper facilities. Complex skyscraper facilities are equipped with constant management systems, such as facility management, lighting management, CCTV management, and parking management, as well as event-based emergency management system, such as fire control, flooding control, seismic detection, and wind detection. While part of the information for each system is currently being collected by a central monitoring system in the form of SI (system integration), it is difficult to perform SOP (standard operating procedure)-based integrated control because data protocols for sensors and receivers are different. An integrated system for efficient countermeasure/evacuation in complex skyscraper facilities is currently under development, and this study organizes the roles and scope of system interface for linkage of information among the integrated system, disaster information collection system, analysis system, and countermeasure system. The scope of disaster at this point was limited to earthquake, flooding, and fire.
