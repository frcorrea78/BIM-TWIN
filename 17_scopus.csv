It is used slightly different over the disparate disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS. © 2018",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052915281

This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors. The paper also proposes the definition of DT for Industry 4.0 manufacturing, elaborated by the European H2020 project MAYA, as a contribution to the research discussion about DT concept. © 2017 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029833606

Current approaches for certification, fleet management and sustainment are largely based on statistical distributions of material properties, heuristic design philosophies, physical testing and assumed similitude between testing and operational conditions and will likely be unable to address these extreme requirements. To address the shortcomings of conventional approaches, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed. This paradigm shift, the Digital Twin, integrates ultra-high fidelity simulation with the vehicle's on-board integrated vehicle health management system, maintenance history and all available historical and fleet data to mirror the life of its flying twin and enable unprecedented levels of safety and reliability.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881388851

As information technology becomes more powerful in terms of the ability to manipulate large parametric models, the potential grows to build increasingly sophisticated functional systems for designing, modeling and fabricating buildings. Implementing more powerful systems implies greater functional specificity, which requires elicitation and capture of increasingly detailed and complex domain-specific semantics and knowledge. This paper explores the extent to which design and engineering knowledge can be practically embedded in production software for building information modeling (BIM). It focuses on a building object behavior (BOB) description notation and method, developed as a shorthand protocol for designing, validating and sharing the design intent of parametric objects. Examples are drawn from an advanced BIM system development project for precast concrete. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748134686

The building activity generates a great number of data and information of various kinds. The management and the communication of these data by the various participants is complex.

It is largely adopted in Formula One car racing, where streams of live data collected from hundreds of sensors installed on car components are transmitted to the pitwall to be used as input of real-time car performance simulations. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of a telemetry-driven approach in a manufacturing environment, where researchers are still looking for efficient methods to perform valuable simulations of the production processes on the basis of real data coming from the factory. The telemetry could contribute to the implementation of a virtual image of the real factory, which in turn could be used to simulate the factory performance, allowing to predict failures or investigate problems, and to reduce costly downtime. This study addresses in particular the efforts to combine and adapt methods and techniques borrowed from the field of Formula One car racing. Moreover, the investigation of the exploitation possibilities of the factory telemetry is paired with the design of a software application supporting this technology, starting from the elicitation and specification of the functional requirements. © 2016 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006985592

However approaches to BIM often lack a holistic perspective that span the whole building lifecycle. The omission of Product Lifecycle Management functions in the implementation of the BIM methodology can lead to failures in delivering the benefits of BIM to operations and diminish its value to clients with large property portfolios. In an empirical study, the paper presents an investigation into the current situation of BIM using an Australian commercial property development project. It explores implications of partial implementation for the building lifecycle. Case study findings identify deficiencies in the project environment, management shortcomings associated with the specifics of client requirements, and difficulties in the transverse use of BIM and PLM platforms due to human interface problems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919338427
