In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048280939

An examination of the assumptions (for example, maintenance independency) of the existing Markovian model reveals possible limitations in its ability to adequately model the procession of deterioration for these purposes. This study uses statistical analysis to identify significant factors influencing the deterioration and develops an application model for estimating the future condition of bridges. Based on data derived from historical maintenance and inspection of concrete decks in Wisconsin, this study identifies 11 significant factors and develops an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict associated deterioration. An analysis of the application of ANN finds that it performs well when modeling deck deterioration in terms of pattern classification. The developed model has the capacity to accurately predict the condition of bridge decks and therefore provide pertinent information for maintenance planning and decision making at both the project level and the network level. © 2010 ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649283282

However, further use of the database to forecast degradation, and thus improve maintenance strategies, is limited due to its complexity, nonlinear relationship, unbalanced inspection records, subjectivity, and missing data. In this study, soft computing methods were applied to develop damage prediction models for bridge abutment walls using the NBI database. The methods were multilayer perceptron network, radial basis function network, support vector machine, supervised self-organizing map, fuzzy neural network, and ensembles of neural networks. An ensemble of neural networks with a novel data organization scheme and voting process was the most efficient model, identifying damage with an accuracy of 86%. Bridge deterioration curves were derived using the prediction models and compared with inspection data. The results show that well developed damage prediction models can be an asset for efficient rehabilitation management of existing bridges as well as for the design of new ones. © 2010 ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953593652

When bridge evaluation is conducted by a visual inspection, a subjective rating is assigned to a bridge component. With analytical evaluation, the rating is computed based on the load applied and the resistance of the bridge component. There have been several attempts to correlate the subjective rating to the analytical rating. The conventional statistical analyses, as well as methods based on fuzzy logic, have not been very successful in providing a clear relationship between the two rating systems. This paper describes the application of neural network systems in developing the relation between subjective ratings and bridge parameters as well as that between subjective and analytical ratings. It is shown that neural networks can be trained and used successfully in estimating a rating based on bridge parameters. The specific application problem for railroad bridges in the commuter rail system in the Chicago metropolitan area is presented. The study showed that a successful training of a network can be achieved, especially if the input data set contains parameters with a diverse combination of intercorrelation coefficients. When the relationship between the bridge subjective rating and bridge parameters was investigated, the network had a prediction rating of about 73%. The study also investigated the relation between the subjective and an alytical rating. In this case, the prediction rate was about 43%. Compared with conventional statistical methods and the fuzzy-logic approach, the neural network system had a much better performance ratio in establishing the relation between the bridge rating and bridge parameters. © 1997 Microcomputers in Civil Engineering.

Machine learning models are powerful and very popular tools for predicting time to failure of such industrial machinery. However, RUL is ill-defined during healthy operation. This paper proposes to use anomaly monitoring during both RUL estimator training and deployment to tackle with this problem. In this approach, raw sensor data is monitored and when a statistically significant change is detected, it is taken as the degradation onset point and a data-driven RUL estimation model is triggered. Initial results with a simple anomaly detector, suited for non-varying operating conditions, and multiple RUL estimation models showed that the anomaly triggered RUL estimation scheme enhances the estimation accuracy, on in-house simulation and benchmark C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation data. The scheme can be employed to varying operating conditions with a suitable anomaly detector. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087791949

The objective of this research is to develop a data-driven approach that enables prediction of future conditions of highway bridge components from historical inspection data. The problem is solved by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with online available NBI data. One prominent feature of the CNN model is that if well-trained it can represent the high dimensional data in the dataset abstractions for which conventional mathematical models may be difficult to describe. A case study of Maryland and Delaware highway bridges using historical data (1992–2017) sourced from the NBI database has been performed to demonstrate the proposed method. CNN models for three primary components of these highway bridges including the deck, superstructure, and substructure have been established. Optimization of model parameters is achieved through a parametric study.

However, many infrastructure managers primary rely on information obtained during visual inspection to subjectively decide on the follow-up maintenance actions. The subjective approach is likely to lack the appropriate use of inspection data and does not promise cost-effective maintenance plans. In this paper, we show that the historical and operational data, readily available at the agencies, is of vital importance and can be used effectively for the recommendations of maintenance advises for bridges. This is achieved by developing a machine learning system that is trained on the past asset management data and provide support to the decision-makers in the condition assessment, risk analysis, and maintenance planning tasks. We have evaluated several traditional learning algorithms as well as the deep neural networks with entity embedding to find the optimal predictive models in terms of predictive capability. Additionally, we have explored the multi-task learning framework that has a shared representation of related prediction tasks to develop a powerful unified model. The analysis of results shows that a unified multi-task learning model performed best for the considered problems followed by task-specific neural networks with entity embedding and class weights. The results of models are further evaluated by instance-level explanations, which provide insights about essential features and explain the importance of data attributes for a particular task. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085108697

Numerous approaches have been developed to overcome the limitations of existing forecasting models. In this article, a direct comparison is made between different models using the same input data to derive conclusions of their distinct performance. The models selected for the comparison were Markov, semi-Markov, and hidden Markov models together with artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have been reported in literature as reliable deterioration prediction models. A quality of fit was performed to measure how well the observed data corresponded to the predicted values, and therefore objectively compare the performance of each model. The results demonstrated that the most accurate prediction was accomplished by the ANN model. Nevertheless, all models presented differences with respect to typical values of concrete decks life expectancy, which is attributed to the inherent difficulties of the database. Additionally, the problem of the visual inspection subjectivity was also regarded as one of the potential causes for the found deviations. Therefore, this article also discusses the shortcomings of current condition assessment practices and encourages future bridge management systems to replace the classical methods by more sophisticated and objective tools. © 2020 fib.

The reasons are higher costs for maintaining the bridges and their significant dependences on structural details. Furthermore it is a well-known fact, that the costs for production and maintaining can be mainly influenced during the design phase of the bridge. Therefore all Life-Cycle-Costs of the bridge, including their mutual dependences has to be known in advance. Mostly this process is difficult to carry out for the maintaining phase, because the prediction of future services and their costs are only fractional realizable. The following article systemizes the different maintaining services and shows possibilities to determine their types and scales. The rewards are to be found in improved monetarily basis for decision-making in the design phase for designers and public authorities. Furthermore the results can be used to compare different maintaining strategies for bridges. © 2006, VDI Fachmedien GmBbH & Co.. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112249088

In this paper, the nonlinear or rather transient relationship between the air temperature and the building temperature is simulated by a machine learning model. Based on this modelling, different use cases for the application of machine learning regression methods to monitoring data are presented, which resulted from practical questions. Basic knowledge of neural networks will be given and for the calculations, long-term monitoring data of valley bridges from VDE 8 are used. It is shown, for example, that these methods can be used to detect and compensate measurement errors or to predict the behaviour of structures. The results show that these methods, have a great potential for the evaluation of large amounts of data since no physical models are required.

In the field of civil engineering, digitalization offers many potentials for all phases of the life cycle of structures, which can be expanded by making data available and defining new ways of working with them. Digital methods, in particular building information modeling (BIM) and structural health monitoring (SHM), offer excellent approaches to satisfy this idea, especially for infrastructure engineering structures and can contribute to make the structure operation more efficient. The process of inspection of infrastructure structures follows fixed deadlines.
