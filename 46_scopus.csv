VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a re-assessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, BIM and IoT integration research are still in nascent stages, there is a need to understand the current situation of BIM and IoT device integration. This paper conducts a comprehensive review with the intent to identify common emerging areas of application and common design patterns in the approach to tackling BIM-IoT device integration along with an examination of current limitations and predictions of future research directions. Altogether, 97 papers from 14 AEC related journals and databases in other industry over the last decade were reviewed. Several prevalent domains of application namely Construction Operation and Monitoring, Health & Safety Management, Construction Logistic & Management, and Facility Management were identified. The authors summarized 5 integration methods with description, examples, and discussion. These integration methods are utilizing BIM tools’ APIs and relational database, transform BIM data into a relational database using new data schema, create new query language, using semantic web technologies and hybrid approach. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and web services-based strategies for BIM and IoT integration, establishing information integration & management standards, solving interoperability issue, and cloud computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060885881

The term appears in business as well as in academic domains. Consultancy firms offer technological hype cycle models to determine the state of development of technological fields in order to facilitate strategic investment decisions. In Science, Technology and Innovation Studies the concept of hype is considered in studies on the dynamics of expectations in innovation processes, which focuses on the performative force of expectations. What is still lacking is a theory of hype patterns that is able to explain the different shapes of hype cycles in different contexts. In this paper we take a first step towards closing this gap by studying and comparing the results of case studies on three hypes in three different empirical domains: voice over internet protocol (VoIP), gene therapy and high-temperature superconductivity. The cases differ in terms of the type of technology and the characteristics of the application environment. We conclude that hype patterns indeed vary a lot, and that the interplay of expectations at different levels affects the ability of a field to cope with hype and disappointment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883465842

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research. © 2020 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082386834

To overcome these limitations and facilitate the spread of TRM technique, we focus on the TRM for R&D purposes, and propose a systematic process and detailed procedures with inputs/outputs for building TRM.

Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (AI-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on AI-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on AI-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on AI-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies.

The current strategy is to mandate the use of BIM for government projects as a way of integrating the design, construction and operation of publicly procured buildings. This aspiration represents a partial turn away from a focus on managerialist agendas towards a belief in the power of digital practices to achieve the aspiration of integrated working, collaboration and innovation, a trend that is being reflected globally in relation to both national and firm-level policy interventions. This paper subjects this so-called ‘BIM revolution’ to critical scrutiny. By drawing on theories of the digital divide, a critical discourse is developed around the ways in which political reform agendas centred on BIM might not stimulate innovation on a wider scale, but could act to disenfranchise small firms that are unable (or unwilling) to engage with them.

However, few instruments and indicators are available to assess the performance of emerging technological innovation systems. In this phase competition often takes place based on expectations rather than on technological performance. This paper therefore focuses on the expectation patterns of technological innovation systems in the exploratory phase through the analysis of the expectation dynamics of three emerging technologies in the field of sustainable mobility within the Netherlands: biofuels, hydrogen as a transport fuel and natural gas as a transport fuel. These technologies do not only compete with the current fossil-fuel based system but also with each other.

As a preventive step, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) of workers (e.g., hard hat and vest) at all times. This paper presents three deep learning (DL) models built on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture to verify PPE compliance of workers; i.e., if a worker is wearing hard hat, vest, or both, from image/video in real-time. In the first approach, the algorithm detects workers, hats, and vests and then, a machine learning model (e.g., neural network and decision tree) verifies if each detected worker is properly wearing hat or vest. In the second approach, the algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and verifies PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In the third approach, the algorithm first detects only the workers in the input image which are then cropped and classified by CNN-based classifiers (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception) according to the presence of PPE attire. All models are trained on an in-house image dataset that is created using crowd-sourcing and web-mining. The dataset, named Pictor-v3, contains ~1,500 annotated images and ~4,700 instances of workers wearing various combinations of PPE components. It is found that the second approach achieves the best performance, i.e., 72.3% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 11 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a good candidate for running on light-weight mobile devices.

However, there has been no systematic attempt to identify and catalogue the different digital technologies and tools available for executing construction procurement activities so as to guide those involved in procurement on the options available to support the six basic procurement activities identified in ISO 10845. The method used to identify 36 different digital technologies and tools used in construction procurement was a literature survey involving systematic identification and review of 78 articles published in 52 different sources between 1993 and 2014. The 36 digital technologies and tools identified include ten generic tools used across the procurement process. This is followed by four applications for establishing what is to be procured; four for soliciting tender offers; one for establishment of procurement strategy; two for tender evaluation, two for award of contract and thirteen for contract administration. The research shows that the majority of existing digital technologies are web-based applications that facilitate real-time communication and collaboration across construction supply chains. The effort made to map digital technologies with the ISO 10845 framework presents a useful contribution to current discourse on digital technology use in construction procurement. It seems interesting that despite the progress made in the evolution and use of digital technologies in construction, there is still no single digital technology which integrates all six construction procurement activities into a system that procurers can adopt to manage the entire construction procurement lifecycle.

The study also aims to formulate a conceptual framework of the different stages in the adoption process identify gaps in the existing literature and to provide a holistic picture of contemporary research in technology adoption in construction research literature. Design/methodology/approach - A generic framework is initially proposed containing the fundamental concepts of ""pre-adoption"", ""adoption"" and ""post-adoption"". The review separates the literature according to three key perspectives: ""socio-economic""; ""managerial""; and ""psychological"". The applicability of the existing approaches to the construction context is discussed, and then a new conceptual framework for construction is developed. Findings - Significant gaps in the understanding of construction technology adoption are identified that provide an interesting agenda for future research. A Construction Technology Adoption Framework is presented, which draws together all of sub-processes involved in technology adoption. This framework covers key activities of both the vendor and the customer. Research limitations/implications - The study has been restricted to information technologies and construction equipment technology. Other construction technologies, such as formwork systems, have not been examined. Practical implications - The new framework provides a direction for research into the technology adoption process including key sub-processes and potential research areas. The framework also assists vendors to influence customers' decision-making processes, and guides new customers in setting up their own decision procedures. Originality/value - This paper departs from earlier research by focusing on information and equipment technology adoption rather than innovation adoption in general. In addition, this paper considers both sides of the adoption equation (vendor and customer), which is in contrast to previous binary studies which considered one side or the other. It delineates the boundaries of different concepts such as diffusion, adoption, acceptance and implementation, which have been interchangeably used in previous studies. This paper introduces the concept of dissemination to construction, which has previously been investigated in other industries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960914763

Myriad technologies are promising innovative solutions to age-old problems of coordination and delivering projects on-time, on-budget and to clients' specifications, through what has come to be known as integrated project delivery. However, there is limited understanding of how these technologies are actually implemented to separate myth from reality. This paper reports on a study, the main aim of which is to enable a better understanding of how digital collaboration technologies are actually used in major construction projects and to what benefit. The objective is to unearth the research evidence through a rigorous process, and to identify, synthesize and interpret this evidence. Through an adaptation of the systematic review methodology, this paper explores the evidence, showing how digital collaboration technologies are being used in the delivery of major building and infrastructure projects. The review finds that these technologies have been severally theorised as boundary objects and digital infrastructure, and as tightly-coupled and clean technologies. The main trajectories that characterise their development and use include visualisation, coordination, automation, integration and transformation. The evidence suggests that integration of people, processes and systems is the underlying and predominant theme in a majority of projects. However, instead of a truly integrated approach, projects have often used digital technologies to achieve partial integration, with design and construction phases having more applications than operations and facilities management. It was also found that digital technology implementations addressing sustainability issues have received less attention, in spite of current government and industry focus on that agenda. The review indicates a diversity of approaches to achieving integration, which means that a clear and uniform approach has yet to be established. Nonetheless, Building Information Modelling (BIM) appears to be the emerging leading paradigm, although it also means different things to different people. The perennial challenge of interoperability still remains, prompting calls for a broader definition to include non-technical aspects. Other major challenges identified in the review include the technologies' material constraints and affordances, leadership, information-risks, training and the measurement of value. Finally, the review highlights areas that could benefit from further research attention. These include more focus on actual BIM implementations in major projects, the challenges of integrating multiple technologies across the whole project/asset lifecycle; and closer attention to their use for addressing sustainability issues. © 2013 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876909628

Classic practice for construction progress tracking relies on paper reports, which entails a serious amount of manual data collection as well as the effort of imagining the actual progress from the paperwork. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a new methodology for monitoring construction progress using smartphones. This is done by proposing a new system consisting of a newly-developed application named “BIM-U” and a mobile augmented reality (AR) channel named “BIM-Phase”. “BIM-U” is an Android application that allows the end-user to update the progress of activities onsite. These data are used to update the project’s 4D model enhanced with different cost parameters such as earned value, actual cost and planned value. The “BIM-Phase” application is a mobile AR channel that is used during construction phase through implementing a 4D “as-planned” phased model integrated with an augmented video showing real or planned progress. Findings: The results from the project are then analysed and assessed to anticipate the potential of these and similar techniques for tracking time and cost on construction projects.

One sector that witnessed tremendous UAV impact is the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Among several AEC applications, UAV technology is currently being implemented for building and bridge inspection, progress monitoring, and urban planning. The following review aims at thoroughly classifying all AEC-related UAV applications within the past decade, extending the understanding of the current state of UAV implementation in the AEC domain, and outlining relevant research trends in this setting. The review follows a systematic literature assessment methodology in which peer-reviewed bibliographical databases were queried, based on specific search keywords, for AEC-related UAV applications. This study also discusses the technological components (flying styles, types of platforms, onboard sensors) to assist in better developing, integrating, and understanding the technology implemented in the AEC industry. Our search query yielded 228 articles, of which 86 met our inclusion criteria and were therefore analyzed. Seven categories of structural and infrastructure inspection, transportation, cultural heritage conservation, city and urban planning, progress monitoring, post-disaster, and construction safety were identified and fully analyzed in this study. The study revealed that UAV integration in the AEC domain might exhibit equal, if not, higher outcomes compared to conventional methods as to time, accuracy, safety, and costs. In terms of technology, the control styles reported were mostly autonomous and manual. Rotary wing vehicles were the predominant type of platforms in the literature. Of the rotary wing type, quadcopters were most commonly employed. Readily available, or “off-the-shelf” video recording cameras and thermal cameras were most frequently mounted on UAVs, followed by LiDAR and laser scanning devices. Other sensors included Radio Frequency Identification and Ultrasonic Beacon System. The outcome of this study would benefit both AEC researchers and professionals to recognize the potentials of UAVs and understand the requirements and challenges for their successful integration. © 2019 The author(s).

There are different types of metro passengers, such as first-time visitors and daily commuters, who may possess different levels of prior spatial knowledge about the metro station. While spatial knowledge is known as an influential factor on people's indoor wayfinding behavior, it has largely remained unknown whether and how the level of completeness of prior spatial knowledge would affect people's wayfinding behavior during emergency evacuation in underground environments such as metro stations. Motivated by this gap, this study aimed to examine the effect of completeness of spatial knowledge on the evacuation behavior of passengers in metro stations, as they observed different patterns of crowd flow. An evacuation experiment was conducted in an immersive virtual environment, which was a virtual representation of a real metro station in Beijing. Participants were divided into six groups according to a 3 × 2 between-participants design. Participants could possess none, partial or complete spatial knowledge of the metro station, acquired from a spatial exploration task, prior to evacuation. Meanwhile, they could observe two patterns of crowd flow, modeled by having virtual avatars evacuating from the metro station evenly or unevenly split at every decision point (DP) along the evacuation routes. Five wayfinding performance measures, as well as the emotional responses, sense of direction, wayfinding anxiety, simulator sickness and sense of presence of all participants were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the completeness of spatial knowledge significantly impacted all measures of participants' evacuation performance, and that the pattern of crowd flow significantly impacted participants' evacuation speed, route choice, and directional choices at two DPs. Significant interaction effect between completeness of spatial knowledge and pattern of crowd flow was observed, which negatively impacted participants' evacuation time, distance and speed. The behavioral explanations underlying these findings, their practical implications and future work are also discussed in the paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079898962

The system is able to explore and reconstruct large scenes at a high level of detail, passing through five semantic levels, finally generating a detailed semantic model of the building. Our autonomous scanning platform collects raw data regarding the scene. At the first level of modelling, our autonomous scanning platform collects data regarding the scene and generates a point cloud that is later structured in a semantic point cloud model containing indoor, clutter and outlier point clouds. The second and third levels of semantic models consist of a simple B-rep representation and a model of basic building components, which includes the walls, ceiling, floor and columns, as well as their topology. Openings are then added, thus yielding our fourth semantic model. Finally, small components in buildings, such as sockets, switches, lights and others are recognised, resulting in the fifth semantic model. This approach has been tested on real data of building floors using our Mobile Platform for Autonomous Digitization (MoPAD). To the authors' knowledge this is the first work that, after obtaining 3D data with an autonomous mobile scanning platform, achieves such detailed modelling of building interiors.

With the need to build more houses and infrastructure, quicker, to high quality and on time, there is a need to upscale the use of advanced technologies. Going digital is a solution that can transform the construction industry by improving productivity measures. The objectives of this paper are to: 1 Identify the availability of transformative technologies and their potential impact on productivity improvement across the construction life cycle and, 2. To investigate the benefits and barriers to technology-uptake in New Zealand construction.
