For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power - providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features - such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation - and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034825352

Current research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction, and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of £878 throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180°) and worst (+45°) orientations of the building was achieved. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958267901

To develop such models for existing buildings, with often unknown the thermal properties, data-driven system identification methods are proposed. In this paper, system identification is carried out to identify suitable reduced-order models. Therefore, grey-box models of increasing complexity are identified on results from simulations with a detailed physical model, deployed in the integrated district energy assessment simulation (IDEAS) package in Modelica. Firstly, the robustness of identified grey-box models for day-ahead predictions and simulations of the thermal response of a dwelling, as well as the physical interpretation of the identified parameters, are analyzed. The influence of the identification dataset is quantified, comparing the added value of dedicated identification experiments against identification on data from in use buildings.

Its application from developing 3D models, structural analysis, cost estimation, and mechanical analysis has now expanded to other applications such as energy simulation. Multiple computer-aided design (CAD) tools work as BIM authoring tools to generate BIM files in different formats containing various types of building information. In addition, there are various building energy modeling (BEM) tools capable of importing these BIM files to perform energy simulation. However, such tools have various capabilities and limitations and need to be investigated and categorized in order to facilitate choosing a proper tool for design professionals in different phases of project and purposes. In addition, interoperability and data exchange issues between BIM and BEM tools should be understood in order to find solutions such as developing proper corrective middleware tools to rectify them. This paper reviews the challenges, issues, and shortcomings in BIM-to-BEM interoperability process (BBIP) by proposing a detailed classification for these issues and studying the available solutions. The paper also explains how a corrective middleware, which is developed by the authors using Python, can be utilized to modify a gbXML file prior to adoption in energy simulation to resolve the issues related to building envelope in BBIP. To do so, initially a review is presented on research studies focused on different types of BIM schemas such as IFC and gbXML and energy simulation tools capable of reading these files such as Green Building Studio (GBS), DesignBuilder, Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES), and OpenStudio. In addition, some of the challenges in the application of BIM for energy simulation such as interoperability issues, lack of standards, and lack of easy solutions for extending existing BIM schemas and available corresponding solutions are also reviewed. With the focus on building envelope in mind, three case studies are discussed to observe the challenges and issues with respect to BBIP using Revit, GBS, and OpenStudio. Moreover, these case studies provide an opportunity to investigate the application of corrective middleware tools similar to what is developed in the study presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056487862

This paper presents a methodology to accurately perform automated envelope calibration under option D (calibrated simulation) of IPMVP - vol. 1. This is frequently ignored because of its complexity, despite being more flexible and accurate in assessing the energy performance of a building. A detailed baseline energy model is used, and by means of a metaheuristic technique achieves a highly reliable and accurate Building Energy Simulation (BES) model suitable for detailed analysis of saving strategies. In order to find this BES model a Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is used, together with a highly efficient engine to stimulate the objective, thus permitting rapid achievement of the goal.

It faces great challenges to meet the goal of transforming the existing building stocks into near zero-energy buildings by 2050. The development of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) schemes in the EU provides a powerful and comprehensive information tool to quantitatively predict annual energy demand from the building stock, creating a demand-driven market for energy-effective buildings. Properties with improved energy rating have had a positive impact on property investments and rental return because of the reduced energy bills. In addition, the EPC databases have been applied to energy planning and building renovations. However, it should be mentioned that the current evaluation system faces problems, such as not being fully implemented, delivering low quality and insufficient information to stimulate renovation, therefore requiring improvements to be made. This paper provides a review of the current EPC situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements. The next generation EPC should rely on BIM technology, benefit from big data techniques and use building smart-readiness indicators to create a more reliable, affordable, comprehensive and customer-tailored instrument, which could better represent energy efficiency, together with occupants’ perceived comfort, and air quality. Improved EPC schemes are expected to play an active role in monitoring building performance, future energy planning and quantifying building renovation rates, promoting energy conservation and sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067995709

One of the strategies to reduce climate change impacts is the decarbonisation of the electricity production: generation mixes are more and more based on renewable energy sources that are replacing the traditional fossil fuels. The effect of the electricity decarbonisation production reflects in the life cycle impacts of buildings, particularly if they are strongly dependent on the electrical energy as the main energy vector. The traditional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) cannot capture the effect of lowering emission factors for electricity generation since only static values are considered. Moreover, also the grid-building interaction should be properly taken into account in the life cycle assessment of buildings using dynamic calculations. A dynamic life cycle analysis is the methodology that can overcome these limitations through the introduction of dynamic parameters within the life cycle inventory and in the life cycle impact assessment stages. A Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (DLCA) is proposed in order to evaluate the consequences of electricity decarbonisation on the LCA of an “all electric” Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB). A comparison with literature results about similar constructions is finally provided. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076216683

The main goal of BEMs is to provide information for building stakeholders; they can be a powerful market tool to increase demand for energy efficiency solutions in buildings without affecting the comfort of users, as well as providing other benefits. The next generation of BEMs should value buildings in a holistic and cost-effective manner across several complementary dimensions: envelope performances, system performances, and controlling the ability of buildings to offer flexible services to the grid by optimizing energy consumption, distributed generation, and storage. SABINA is a European project that aims to look for flexibility to the grid, targeting the most economic source possible: existing thermal inertia in buildings. In doing so, SABINA works with a new generation of BEMs that tend to mimic the thermal behavior of real buildings and therefore requires an accurate methodology to choose the model that complies with the requirements of the system. This paper details our novel extensive research on which statistical indices should be chosen in order to identify the best model offered by the calibration process developed by Fernandez et al. in a previous paper and therefore is a continuation of that work. © 2019 by the authors.

In literature, several studies highlight the importance of innovative approaches in order to reduce the cost of the ZEB targets achievement, during the early stage design process. In this framework, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a useful process that integrated building design since the first design stage, providing high-performance energy solutions and obtaining a single model reducing time and cost during the building design.

The accuracy of the results depends not only on the fit of the energy model used, but also on the required external files, and the weather file is one of the most important. One of the sources for obtaining meteorological data for a certain period of time is through an on-site weather station; however, this is not always available due to the high costs and maintenance. This paper shows a methodology to analyze the impact on the simulation results when using an on-site weather station and the weather data calculated by a third-party provider with the purpose of studying if the data provided by the third-party can be used instead of the measured weather data. The methodology consists of three comparison analyses: weather data, energy demand, and indoor temperature. It is applied to four actual test sites located in three different locations. The energy study is analyzed at six different temporal resolutions in order to quantify how the variation in the energy demand increases as the time resolution decreases. The results showed differences up to 38% between annual and hourly time resolutions. Thanks to a sensitivity analysis, the influence of each weather parameter on the energy demand is studied, and which sensors are worth installing in an on-site weather station are determined. In these test sites, the wind speed and outdoor temperature were the most influential weather parameters. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090417171

In fact, they need to comply with several standards (ASHRAE 14-2014, FEMP 4.0, IP-MVP) that establish limits to the definition of calibrated models.
