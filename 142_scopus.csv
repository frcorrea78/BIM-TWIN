However, there is a lack of systematic review of existing research efforts and achievements. A comprehensive review on existing research provides great benefits to identify where more efforts are needed and therefore the future research directions. For this purpose, this paper reviews the literature related to the subject area of intelligent building. Our review indicates that previous research efforts have dealt mainly with three research aspects including advanced and innovative intelligent technologies research, performance evaluation methodologies and investment evaluation analysis. It is also identified that among the three research aspects, relatively less literature has been found addressing the issues of investment evaluation of intelligent buildings. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the paper also summarizes a few future research directions, which are useful to researchers working in this important area. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Short Survey,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444258169

It explicitly considers experiences involving new technology-enabled services, such as digital twins and automated social presence (i.e. virtual assistants and service robots). Design/methodology/approach: Future customer experiences are conceptualized within a three-dimensional space – low to high digital density, low to high physical complexity and low to high social presence – yielding eight octants. Findings: The conceptual framework identifies eight “dualities,” or specific challenges connected with integrating digital, physical and social realms that challenge organizations to create superior customer experiences in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. The eight dualities are opposing strategic options that organizations must reconcile when co-creating customer experiences under different conditions. Research limitations/implications: A review of theory demonstrates that little research has been conducted at the intersection of the digital, physical and social realms. Most studies focus on one realm, with occasional reference to another. This paper suggests an agenda for future research and gives examples of fruitful ways to study connections among the three realms rather than in a single realm. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for managers in designing and managing customer experiences that the authors believe will need to be addressed by the year 2050. Social implications: This paper discusses important societal issues, such as individual and societal needs for privacy, security and transparency. It sets out potential avenues for service innovation in these areas. Originality/value: The conceptual framework integrates knowledge about customer experiences in digital, physical and social realms in a new way, with insights for future service research, managers and public policy makers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053283291

A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter’s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system’s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds. © 2019 by the authors.

However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals’ survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants’ heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals’ thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including PCS control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models (PMV, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the PMV and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on PCS control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants’ heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals’ thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038211868

Indeed, they will be no longer designed and managed only as financial products, but also as service providers to support the needs of the occupants. This is a great challenge in the building sector, that is experiencing a period of various (r)evolution concerning products, technologies and processes. This research defines a digitally enabled framework for operating cognitive buildings, presenting a case study by which it has been possible to analyze how information collected during operations could inform end-users (i.e. administrators, owners, facility managers and occupants) about the behavior of both buildings and occupants. Focusing on building in-use stages, advantages in tracking the behavior of occupants and in satisfying the needs of users should be derived through the availability of real-time information, i.e. collected by sensors. In this way, not only the behavior of users could be taken into account, but also predicted performance could be correlated with real measurement and, consequently, the building performance gap should be estimated and filled. A connection between asdesigned virtual models (resulted from a BIM - Building Information Modeling - process) and as-delivered physical assets (monitored in real-time, i.e. through BMS - Building Management Systems) could be established to explore how BIM practices and technologies could improve a data-driven asset management, by enriching building information in operation. The results should allow pointing out how data and information gathered along building life cycle could provide services to users. © 2016 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994078616

This system shall generate, assess, and execute control strategies, and find optimal control solutions. By introducing an intelligent system that identifies specific control strategies for a building and optimizes toward its specific usage, we achieve the advantage of automatically generating automation and control solutions, saving the efforts for manual adaptation. We introduce the knowledge base and the cognitive system, and explain the methodology and algorithms used to implement the required functions.

Different spatial compositions of elements define different spatial boundaries, and each produces a unique local spatial experience to observers inside the space. Therefore an architectural style brings about a distnct spatial experience. While multple representation methods are practced in the field of architecture, there lacks a compelling way to capture and identfy spatial experiences. Describing an observer's spatial experiences quanttatively and efficiently is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that employs 3D isovist methods and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve recognition of local spatial compositions. The case studies conducted validate that this methodology works well in capturing and identfying local spatial conditions, illustrates the patern and frequency of their appearance in designs, and indicates peculiar spatial experiences embedded in an architectural style. The case study used small designs by Mies van der Rohe and Aldo van Eyck. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it introduces a sampling method based on 3D Isovist that generates a 2D image that can be used to represent a 3D space from a specific observation point. Second, it employs a CNN model to extract features from the sampled images, then classifies their corresponding space. Third, it demonstrates a few case studies where this space classification method is applied to different architectural styles. © 2017 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.
