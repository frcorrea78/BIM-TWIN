It is closely related with the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical System (CPS), information and communications technology (ICT), Enterprise Architecture (EA), and Enterprise Integration (EI). Despite of the dynamic nature of the research on Industry 4.0, however, a systematic and extensive review of recent research on it is has been unavailable. Accordingly, this paper conducts a comprehensive review on Industry 4.0 and presents an overview of the content, scope, and findings of Industry 4.0 by examining the existing literatures in all of the databases within the Web of Science. Altogether, 88 papers related to Industry 4.0 are grouped into five research categories and reviewed. In addition, this paper outlines the critical issue of the interoperability of Industry 4.0, and proposes a conceptual framework of interoperability regarding Industry 4.0. Challenges and trends for future research on Industry 4.0 are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020118455

Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. © 2010 IBM.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953821440

Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a 'BIM System-of-Systems' (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged.

It explicitly considers experiences involving new technology-enabled services, such as digital twins and automated social presence (i.e. virtual assistants and service robots). Design/methodology/approach: Future customer experiences are conceptualized within a three-dimensional space – low to high digital density, low to high physical complexity and low to high social presence – yielding eight octants. Findings: The conceptual framework identifies eight “dualities,” or specific challenges connected with integrating digital, physical and social realms that challenge organizations to create superior customer experiences in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. The eight dualities are opposing strategic options that organizations must reconcile when co-creating customer experiences under different conditions. Research limitations/implications: A review of theory demonstrates that little research has been conducted at the intersection of the digital, physical and social realms. Most studies focus on one realm, with occasional reference to another. This paper suggests an agenda for future research and gives examples of fruitful ways to study connections among the three realms rather than in a single realm. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for managers in designing and managing customer experiences that the authors believe will need to be addressed by the year 2050. Social implications: This paper discusses important societal issues, such as individual and societal needs for privacy, security and transparency. It sets out potential avenues for service innovation in these areas. Originality/value: The conceptual framework integrates knowledge about customer experiences in digital, physical and social realms in a new way, with insights for future service research, managers and public policy makers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053283291

The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry is undergoing a major paradigm shift that will require building owners to develop lifecycle-oriented BIM strategies. Consequently, owners will play a vital role in improving the maturity of future BIM-assisted projects through their requirements documentation, assessment of the quality and accuracy of BIM deliverables, and continued application of BIM during facilities management (FM). The primary objective of this research study was to develop a framework for building owner organizations to use in the assessment of their BIM competency. Using the Delphi technique, 66 critical factors that are influential in the evaluation of owners' BIM competency were identified and prioritized on the basis of the perceptions of 21 prequalified BIM experts. The data derived from the Delphi phase were then used to propose an assessment tool that allows owners to evaluate their operations across three diverse competency areas and 12 specifically tailored competency categories.

The model developed for the simulation of CO levels is used in conjunction with a general-purpose CFD code, PHOENICS that can provide detailed information on the CO concentration and velocity fields in a three-dimensional configuration. The transient variation of CO concentration was simulated under different scenarios of ventilation rates. Experimental measurements on the CO level inside the garage were performed using the portable, electrochemical CO monitor (Solomat's MPM4100). From the continuous readings, instantaneous readings were stored every 15s by the data log system. These data were used to verify the simulation results.

This huge number, as well as the variety of processes that may be performed on a pipe, require rigorous identification, quality assessment and traceability. Traditionally, such tasks have been carried out by using manual procedures and following documentation on paper, which slows down the production processes and reduces the output of a pipe workshop. This article presents a system that allows for identifying and tracking the pipes of a ship through their construction cycle. For such a purpose, a fog computing architecture is proposed to extend cloud computing to the edge of the shipyard network. The system has been developed jointly by Navantia, one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, and the University of A Coruña (Spain), through a project that makes use of some of the latest Industry 4.0 technologies. Specifically, a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is described, which uses active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to track pipes and detect relevant events. Furthermore, the CPS has been integrated and tested in conjunction with Siemens’ Manufacturing Execution System (MES) (Simatic IT). The experiments performed on the CPS show that, in the selected real-world scenarios, fog gateways respond faster than the tested cloud server, being such gateways are also able to process successfully more samples under high-load situations. In addition, under regular loads, fog gateways react between five and 481 times faster than the alternative cloud approach. © 2018 by the authors.

The urban parking garage is a microenvironment that is of concern but has not been characterized. Using time-resolved measurement methods, we evaluated air toxics levels within an urban parking garage and assessed the influence of vehicle activity and type on their levels. Carbon monoxide (CO) and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAH) were measured with direct-reading instruments. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured in 30 min intervals using a sorbent tube loaded sequential sampler. Vehicle volume and type were evaluated by video recording. Sampling was conducted from June 24 to July 17, 2002. We observed garage traffic median volumes of 71 counts/h on weekdays and 6 counts/h on weekends. The 12-fold reduction in traffic volume from weekday to weekend corresponded with a decrease in median air pollution that varied from a minimum 2- (CO) to a maximum 7 (pPAH)-fold. The actual 30-min median weekday and weekend values were: CO-2.6/1.2 ppm; pPAH-19/2.6 ng/m3; 1,3-butadiene-0.5/0.2 μg/m3, MTBE-7.4/0.4 μg/m3; and benzene-2.7/0.3 μg/m3. The influence of traffic was quantified using longitudinal models. The pollutant coefficients provide an indication of the average air pollution vehicle source contribution and ranged from 0.31 (CO) to 1.08 (pPAH) percent increase/vehicle count. For some pollutants, a slightly higher (0.5-0.6%) coefficient was observed for light-trucks relative to cars.

Wuhan Metro's Sanyang road tunnel, which crosses the Yangtze River in China, was selected for this case study. A slurry shield machine with a cutter diameter of 15.76 m was designed to be hoisted for 44 m into the underground tunnel shafts. The major challenges of this hoisting were as follows: 1) complex construction environment for hoisting, 2) limited visibility of crane operator or blind hoisting, and 3) precise control of position and gesture of a giant cutter wheel in real time. To overcome these challenges, the CPS-SMS was proposed to simulate and monitor the hoisting process to avoid the unsafe status of cranes and the hoisted cutter wheel. Internet-of-things technologies, such as wireless sensor-based location and tracking, self-organized Wi-Fi, and bi-directional communication, were used to prevent accidents in the changing and dynamic hoisting process. The implementation of monitoring blind hoist in the Yangtze River, which crosses the metro tunnel construction site, was successful, that is, no collision or injury occurred.

Hierarchical regression results provide evidence that after controlling for related organizational characteristics (including organizational experience in participating in large and influential projects, organizational ownership type, organization age, and organization size), degree and eigenvector centrality in relationship networks in an earlier period as a group significantly predicts organizational success in winning new project contracts in a later period. The results also provide evidence that due to their differences in BIM capability and innovation reputation, the competitiveness of designers and general contractors relate differently to the structure of their project-based interfirm relationship networks, with the competitiveness of designers more associated with the quantity of collaborative ties, whereas the competitiveness of general contractors relates more to the collaborative ties with high-status partners. As an exploratory effort at using longitudinal data to investigate the associations between interfirm relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness in the construction industry, this study contributes to the construction literature not only by validating the value of project-based interfirm relationships in generating social capital and thus relating to organizational competitiveness, but also by providing evidence for how the specific association between project-based relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness is contingent on the attributes of the network actors. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040726482

BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in that can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to facility managers to improve AM processes. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044665526

Particulate matter has been confirmed as a major pollutant in garage spaces, and exposure to these particles, especially submicron and ultrafine particles, is closely associated with the health of vehicle owners and people who work in garages. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal patterns of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 in a naturally ventilated underground residential parking garage using field measurements collected at various times over a one-year period. The impacts of traffic flow, air exchange rate, and outdoor particles were determined by employing Pearson correlation and a mass-balance model. The results showed significant seasonal diurnal patterns of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0, with maximum values during winter and minimum values during summer. The daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 in the garage exceeded the long-term (24 h) exposure limit of the Chinese standard (0.15 mg/m3 for PM10 and 0.075 mg/m3 for PM2.5) during spring, fall and winter, with the highest PM10 and PM2.5 concentration exceeding the limit eightfold. Use of natural ventilation only in the residential underground parking garage could not guarantee that particle pollution was at a “safe” exposure level in the study. During the measurements, the hourly mean PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 appeared to vary linearly under the combined effects of the air exchange rate multiplied by the outdoor particles; traffic flow; and mean PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 during the past hour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027680945

The evolution of BIM as digital infrastructure is studied in a network of companies developing and using BIM tools for new ways of working in the Finnish HVAC industry. The research methodology is a deductive case study testing a theoretical framework derived from the literature. The main finding is that BIM has emerged as digital infrastructure in design and construction, while development has stalled in use and operations. The explanation for the successful outcome in design and construction is found in the evidence of three sociotechnical actions of adoption, reuse, and recombination activating self-reinforcing positive developments in design and construction. The stalled development in use and operations is explained by a lack of adoption and reuse, which in turn inhibits the tool and process development required for increasing adoption. Servitization by extending project duration and aligning the business of actors to life cycle performance, standardization of interfaces and processes, and open architectures are identified as actions to activate digital infrastructure evolution for the later life cycle stages of a building. The originality and value of the paper is to demonstrate how the theoretical framework of sociotechnical action explains the emergence of BIM as digital infrastructure and how findings can be applied to identify specific management interventions to enable more successful outcomes. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931068512

The research utilizes a competitive dynamics perspective (CDP) as the theoretical lens and analyses data collected from 135 SMEs using Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to provide a richer insight into levels of BIM implementation maturity. Findings reveal that there is no meaningful association between BIM implementation maturity within SMEs and their organizational attributes, such as size and level of experience. A paucity of solid evidence to support a reasonable return on investment (ROI) was also identified as a key barrier to using BIM in higher levels of maturity. In practical terms, the study focuses on pertinent issues associated with mandated BIM in Australia from SMEs' perspectives, pointing out potential consequences and challenging the pressure for mandating. The research concludes by outlining industrial implications and providing pragmatic recommendations designed to accelerate the pace that Australian SMEs move across a BIM trajectory from nonadoption to higher levels of maturity. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048867962

The empirical data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed using the partial least-squares technique. The results show there is a strong relationship between BIM implementation and the performance of OSM projects through integration management and cooperation behavior. Contract management plays a negative moderating effect on the relationship between integration management and the performance of OSM projects.
