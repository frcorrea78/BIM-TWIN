In order to aid the biological analysis of such growth data as are capable of representation by the function, general rate parameters are deduced which are related in a simple manner to its constants. © 1959 Oxford University Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043147979

Giving suggestions for future developments, and outlining keys for successful implementation of models the book provides a thorough and up-to-date, single source reference for students, researchers and practitioners requiring a current digest of research and methods in the field. The book describes current modelling approaches for predicting forest growth and yield and explores the components that comprise the various modelling approaches. It provides the reader with the tools for evaluating and calibrating growth and yield models and outlines the steps necessary for developing a forest growth and yield model. Single source reference providing an evaluation and synthesis of current scientific literature. Detailed descriptions of example models. Covers statistical techniques used in forest model construction. Accessible, reader-friendly style. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Book,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891579288

The canopy gap fraction was sampled with a Plant Canopy Analyser (PCA; LAI 2000, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 200 regularly spaced points in the understorey. A comparison of predicted and observed values of diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) shows that the above model can predict most of the spatial variability of the diffuse fluxes (R2 = 0.97). In order to evaluate the variation in light penetration due to needle clumping in shoots, two architectural hypotheses are tested: random distribution of needles (scenario 1) and of shoots (scenario 2) within crowns. Results indicate that the variability in the radiative fluxes due to shoot architecture is rather limited in comparison with the variability generated by canopy discontinuities. However, assuming shoots as the basic foliage element slightly improves the model performance. The predictive accuracy for the two architectural hypotheses is similar, with a mean absolute percent error of 12.2 and 12.0% for scenarios 1 and 2; respectively. The predictive bias is almost equivalent in magnitude but opposite in sign (mean percent error of -4.82 and 3.55% for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively). The underestimation of the DIFN in the first scenario suggests that, when needles are considered as basic foliage elements, the spatial distribution is not random, but clumped. On the contrary, the overestimation of DIFN in scenario 2 indicates that the spatial distribution of shoots is more regular than random. The angular distribution of the predictive error in the bands of the PCA suggests that the angular distribution of the shoot normal was more ellipsoidal than the spherical one adopted in the simulation, while leaf clumping in whorls appears to be the source of the high gap fraction at larger zenith angles.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030840906
