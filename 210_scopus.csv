Understanding the relationship between demographic characteristics and the use of geoservices and geotagging on twitter",2015,"PLoS ONE",135,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952673791&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0142209&partnerID=40&md5=d2d715cc9992da99fe45805e5aabad55","In this paper we take advantage of recent developments in identifying the demographic characteristics of Twitter users to explore the demographic differences between those who do and do not enable location services and those who do and do not geotag their tweets. We discuss the collation and processing of two datasets - one focusing on enabling geoservices and the other on tweet geotagging. We then investigate how opting in to either of these behaviours is associated with gender, age, class, the language in which tweets are written and the language in which users interact with the Twitter user interface. We find statistically significant differences for both behaviours for all demographic characteristics, although the magnitude of association differs substantially by factor. We conclude that there are significant demographic variations between those who opt in to geoservices and those who geotag their tweets. Not withstanding the limitations of the data, we suggest that Twitter users who publish geographical information are not representative of the wider Twitter population.

A problem with current VR applications in AEC/FM is that the manual conversation from official design data (e.g., a BIM model) to VR displays is difficult and time consuming. There is a lack of automated and efficient data transfer approach between BIM and VR. In this paper, we will introduce a BIM[sbnd]VR real-time synchronization system called BVRS, which is based on an innovative Cloud-based BIM metadata interpretation and communication method. BVRS allows users to update BIM model changes in VR headsets (such as Oculus Rift DK2) automatically and simultaneously. We tested BVRS in a variety of design change scenarios including changing object dimensions, changing object locations and changing object types. Results confirmed the usability and efficiency of BVRS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031747080

We perform analysis and comparison of temporal events, rankings of sightseeing places in a city, and study mobility of people using geotagged photos. We take a systematic approach to accomplish these tasks by applying scalable computational techniques, using statistical and data mining algorithms, combined with interactive geo-visualization. We provide exploratory visual analysis environment, which allows the analyst to detect spatial and temporal patterns and extract additional knowledge from large geotagged photo collections.

The workers' knowledge is elicited both directly, by asking them for feedback during the activity simulation, and indirectly, by collecting and analysing position tracking data. The application of this approach in a real case study demonstrates its beneficial impact in terms of the sharing of planning and safety-related information between project partners and its formal representation in a Health and Safety Plan. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081906819

This paper argues that one of the major issues preventing a more productive dialogue between critical human geographers and those already engaging in the mapping and analysis of these new data sources is around the ways that space and spatiality are conceptualized in social media mapping. As such, this paper draws on and extends earlier critiques of the ‘spatial ontology of the geotag’, in which the geographic analysis of geotagged social media data over-privileges the single latitude/longitude coordinate pair attached to each individual data point, often leading to the kind of simplistic mappings and interpretations prevalent today. The goals of this paper are two-fold: first, to demonstrate how the spatial ontology of the geotag is implicitly operationalized within mainstream social media mapping exercises, and how this understanding of space remains incongruent with existing conceptions of space drawn from human geography. Second, using the example of tweeting in the wake of the August 2014 killing of an unarmed African–American teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, this paper demonstrates how a more geographically-situated analysis of this kind of data, inspired by relational or multidimensional conceptualizations of space, can yield alternative understandings of the social processes embedded in such data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962252816

To stimulate local economies, it is necessary to attract foreign tourists to various areas of a country. This research aims to develop a method of extracting the locations of tourist destinations in a country and to understand what characteristics foreign tourists expect of areas near tourist attractions compared with what domestic tourists expect. In this paper, a tourist destination is defined as a small area that has places of interests for tourists such as historic sites, theme parks, hotels, and restaurants. The methods proposed in this paper are applied to data acquired from Twitter and Foursquare in Japan. The proposed method successfully extracts the locations of tourist destinations and characterizes those locations based on the points of interest in the neighborhood. The results indicate that foreign tourists who come to Japan expect nightlife spots (bars, nightclubs, etc.) to be located in the neighborhood of tourist destinations, in contrast to the expectations of domestic tourists. The proposed methods are applicable to not only Japan, but to any country. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044541716

Thanks to the rapid development and advancement of computer technology in recent years, it can now be used to a large extent, with more detail to show and is now more affordable than before. The use of virtual reality is currently devoted to many disciplines and it can be expected that its popularity will grow progressively over the next few years. The Laboratory of Photogrammetry at the Czech Technical University in Prague is also interested in VR and focuses mainly on documentation and visualization of historical buildings and objects. Our opinion is that in the field of virtual reality there is great potential and extensive possibilities. 3D models of historical objects, primarily created by photogrammetric IBRM technology (image based modelling and rendering) or by laser scanning, gain a completely different perspective in VR. In general, most of the newly designed buildings are now being implemented into BIM. For certain projects, historical buildings or constructions should also have implemented into BIM. As a basic input into BIM, an accurate 3D spatial documentation of the condition is needed with special accent to additional information like engineering networks, materials, etc. Creating BIM is one thing, visualizing a model is another. The historical object is irregular and it is difficult to create its simplified form as the CAD model; it is much easier with modern buildings. The question is always the appropriate type of visualization, where virtual reality can be a very useful technology. So-called game engines such as Unreal engine or Unity are used to create a virtual world. These are highly sophisticated tools that make it possible to create a suitable environment, where you can place created models and then view and analyse them with the help of VR glasses. In our contribution, we would like to show an example of a technology line that allows you to convert an object documented by laser scanning into virtual reality. An older industrial building prepared for future reconstruction was chosen as a case study. This object was scanned by a laser scanner, a 3D model was created and material types and engineering networks were added into the model. © Authors 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074627711

By combining BIM with the latest visualization technologies, powerful, semi-immersive experiences can be developed to enhance the dissemination of CH. In semi-immersive experiences such as Augmented Reality (AR), digital content can be overlapped on to physical spaces, providing a new way to interact with both the physical space and the digital content. This paper discusses the translation of a digital object created using BIM, into a physical object and the utilisation of this physical object as a trigger for an AR experience. The case study looks at one of the neo- Gothic window frames from the House of Commons in the Centre Block of the Parliament Hill National Historic Site, in Ottawa, Canada. The window frame is one in a series that represents a Canadian province or territory with a stained glass feature that includes floral emblems and heraldic symbols from the respective provincial or territorial shield. The frame in this case study corresponds to the stained glass window of five provinces. Using the replica frame as a target, the user can select which stained glass windows they would like to view in the AR application. Through these combined technologies, we argue that CH can be revealed in a more interactive way and therefore more engaging manner - making even inaccessible architectural details readily available to the public. © Authors 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065399007

According to the research trends, data visualization of an occupant’s feedback is an important perspective and surveys through POE methods have provided a quick and cost-effective approach for gathering and analyzing an occupant’s feedback. Therefore, the objective of this study is to establish a web-based building occupant survey system that incorporates new approaches based on a geographic information system (GIS) tool and open-source spatial information. This paper reports the following to provide the detailed system framework: (1) development requirements from literature reviews; (2) integration of collected data and 3D (three dimensional) spatial information; (3) system processes and user-friendly functions; and (4) pilot test and data visualization. The difference between the proposed platform and existing online survey systems is that in the former the survey responses are linked to the 3D spatial information of the buildings on a map. Thus, the results provide more intuitive insights for building managers and occupants to identify specific performance issues related to the building. © 2020 by the authors.
