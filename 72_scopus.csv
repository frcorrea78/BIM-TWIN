At the same time, various national manufacturing development strategies have been put forward, such as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet, manufacturing based on Cyber-Physical System, and Made in China 2025. However, one of specific challenges to achieve smart manufacturing with these strategies is how to converge the manufacturing physical world and the virtual world, so as to realize a series of smart operations in the manufacturing process, including smart interconnection, smart interaction, smart control and management, etc. In this context, as a basic unit of manufacturing, shop-floor is required to reach the interaction and convergence between physical and virtual spaces, which is not only the imperative demand of smart manufacturing, but also the evolving trend of itself. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin shop-floor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data. What is more, the operation mechanisms and implementing methods for DTS are studied and key technologies as well as challenges ahead are investigated, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030752762

To address the shortcomings of conventional approaches, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed.

Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability of resources, and ""map"" of the respective supply chains visually.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

Nowadays increasingly intelligent, individualized products encourages companies to respond innovatively to customer requirements and to handle the rising product variations quickly. An integrated engineering network, spanning across the entire value chain, is operated to intelligently connect various company divisions, and to generate a business ecosystem for products, services and communities. The conditions for the digital twin are thereby determined in which the digital world can be fed into the real, and the real world back into the digital to deal such intelligent products with rising variations. The term digital twin can be described as a digital copy of a real factory, machine, worker etc., that is created and can be independently expanded, automatically updated as well as being globally available in real time. Every real product and production site is permanently accompanied by a digital twin. First prototypes of such digital twins already exist in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory on a cloud- and app-based software that builds on a dynamic, multidimensional data and information model. A standardized language of the robot control systems via software agents and positioning systems has to be integrated. The aspect of the continuity of the real factory in the digital factory as an economical means of ensuring continuous actuality of digital models looks as the basis of changeability. For the indoor localization sensor combinations that in addition to the hardware already contain the software required for the sensor data fusion should be used.

Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085247924

However, the construction industry continues to struggle to achieve higher levels of modularization. Since the characteristics and environments in dense urban areas differ to those in rural areas, strategy, pre-project planning, project execution planning, and actual execution of modular construction should also differ. However, research so far has not focused on the implementation of modular methods in urban environments. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify unique challenges and opportunities for implementing modular techniques in urban environments. To meet this goal, this paper examined the current practices, benefits, and barriers in highly dense urban areas by employing a three staged-sequential approach involving the preliminary investigation, main survey (106 responses from 39 companies), and ex-post in-depth interviews with 10 experts. The results show that (1) ‘better site operations’ was selected by practitioners as the greatest benefit, and ‘site access and on-site storage area’ was selected as the key barrier and (2) the practitioners experienced difficulties in transporting modules in urban areas. These findings offer valuable implications to modular technique implementation in urban areas around the world. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030868823

This raises the question of assessing the impact of a new infrastructure project on the community prior to its commencement-what type of technologies can potentially be used for creating a virtual representation of the city? How can a smart city be improved by utilizing these technologies? There are a wide range of technologies and applications available but understanding their function, interoperability, and compatibility with the community requires more discussion around system designs and architecture. These questions can be the basis of developing an agenda for further investigations. In particular, the need for advanced tools such as mobile scanners, Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Geospatial Augmented Reality apps, Light Detection, and Ranging in smart cities is discussed.

An SC for personalised production has redundant inventory and operation capacity; therefore, it requires a system that can achieve recoverability for operation resilience. Thus, a standalone cyber physical system (CPS) has limitation for SC control with MTO. To solve this problem, the CPS must be coordinated, and a systematic approach is required. This study proposes a cyber physical logistics system (CPLS) that is coordinated with the agent cyber physical production systems in a multi-level CPS structure. This multi-level architectural framework is designed to provide technical functionalities for resilient SC control. The service composition procedures of technical functionalities on the distributed digital twin (DT) simulation are divided into type and instance stages. The operation procedures of the DT application and technical functionality of the DT engine are suggested. The proposed CPLS has appropriate service composition and operation for the bullwhip and ripple effects, which are the two main SC-related problems.

Despite such importance, the elderly's mobility remains limited because of various types of stressful interactions with the built environment in their daily trips. Recently, the introduction of a Smart City Digital Twins paradigm has demonstrated the potential to simulate and optimize interventions that minimize stressful interactions between elderly individuals and the built environment. Despite such potential, the current urban sensing in the Digital Twins has only gathered a rudimentary level of interaction data, such as people's locations and trajectories. Recent advancements in wearable biosensors enable us to measure stress in elderly people without interfering with their daily lives, which can greatly strengthen the capability of the current Digital Twins' analytics platform. In this paper, the authors propose a wearable biosensor and hotspot analysis-based framework to continuously monitor the elderly's stressful interactions with the built environment. Specifically, this study aims to: (1) create a computational model to identify individual stress from different physiological signals collected in daily trip contexts using wearable biosensors; and (2) develop a GIS-based hotspot analysis to detect stress hotspots, on which elderly individuals have stressful interactions with the built environment. To test the proposed framework, stress hotspots were detected based on 30 elderly subjects' data collected during 2 weeks of their daily trips. The detected stress hotspots were then investigated by site inspections and interviews with subjects. The results showed that the detected stress hotspots are spatially correlated with the elderly subjects' stressful interactions with the built environment. The findings demonstrate that a hotspot analysis with wearable biosensors can detect spatiotemporal stressful interactions between the elderly and the built environment. The proposed sensing framework strengthens the Smart City Digital Twins paradigm for more human-centered simulation visualizing elderly individuals' stressful interactions with the built environment, which can be a basis for optimizing interventions to improve the elderly's mobility. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080876266

Through a three-step research process integrating bibliometric search, quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis, the literature of MiC was extensively analyzed. The aim was to identify ongoing research trends and current gaps that will benefit future research in this vital domain. The quantitative analysis of literature showed that almost 50% of research in MiC was conducted in only four countries. Science mapping of author keywords showed the connection between MiC and topics, such as simulation, sustainability, and scheduling, which indicated the diverse nature of the existing literature. The qualitative analysis of the literature showed that the categories of building design and management aspects were dominating the research in the area. Gaps in MiC research encompassed lack of quantitative analysis to assess the benefits of various innovative design proposals, lack of cost analysis for MiC to measure its savings, and lack of analysis to adopt the appropriate project delivery method in MiC projects. Future research directions comprise developing models to analyze stakeholder relationships during the design stage, examining contractual relationship among participants, investigating cost comparisons with different construction methods, and assessing the methods for introducing MiC into the curriculum of future engineers.
