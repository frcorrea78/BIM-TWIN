While some of these needs are addressed by several existing FM information systems, building information modeling (BIM), which is becoming widely adopted by the construction industry, holds undeveloped possibilities for providing and supporting FM practices with its functionalities of visualization, analysis, control, and so on. This paper explores how BIM can be a beneficial platform for supplementing FM practices. An online survey and face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess the current status of BIM implementations in FM, potential applications, and the level of interest in the utilization of BIM. Interactions between BIM and FM are defined by illustrating application areas and data requirements for BIM-enabled FM practices. Highlighting the synergy between the two, this paper can help professionals recognize potential areas in which BIM can be useful in FM practices. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859575621

Much of this is because of the lack of experience by owner organizations in using BIM during operations and maintenance (O&M). The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry is undergoing a major paradigm shift that will require building owners to develop lifecycle-oriented BIM strategies. Consequently, owners will play a vital role in improving the maturity of future BIM-assisted projects through their requirements documentation, assessment of the quality and accuracy of BIM deliverables, and continued application of BIM during facilities management (FM). The primary objective of this research study was to develop a framework for building owner organizations to use in the assessment of their BIM competency. Using the Delphi technique, 66 critical factors that are influential in the evaluation of owners' BIM competency were identified and prioritized on the basis of the perceptions of 21 prequalified BIM experts. The data derived from the Delphi phase were then used to propose an assessment tool that allows owners to evaluate their operations across three diverse competency areas and 12 specifically tailored competency categories. These evaluations can then be used by owners to assess and expand their technical knowledge, improve their current BIM requirements, and increase the efficiency of their postconstruction operations. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950241069

Because the life cycle of a building is quite long, such details have significant influence on the accuracy of evaluation results. To fill in this gap and extend the LCA system, this paper developed a dynamic assessment framework based on LCA principles after reviewing the research progress of DLCA (dynamic LCA). The new framework identified four dynamic building properties (i.e., technological progress, variation in occupancy behavior, dynamic characteristic factors, and dynamic weighting factors) and considered them in corresponding assessment steps to realize real-time EIA. In addition, residential occupancy profiles were described at personal level, family level, and social level; and three potential quantification methods were introduced to explore the relationship between occupancy profiles and household energy consumption. The DLCA framework expands the connotation of the LCA system from a dynamic perspective, making it possible to present time-varying EIs of buildings over their long life cycle and guide occupancy behavior in time. This framework has the potential to be base for developing a useful tool for conducting forecast evaluation and promoting sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020242059

Although it has a widespread impact on the industry, the systematic implementation of BIM in projects faces challenges. This study integrated BIM into the lifecycle of a building project with the introduction of a conceptual framework constituted by BIM Information Flow, BIM Model Chain, BIM Workflow, BIM Institutional Environment, and BIM-based Project Management Information System (PMIS). This conceptual framework identifies the key areas for integrating BIM into the project lifecycle and explains how BIM works for project management practice. Through an ethnographic action research approach, the study developed a BIM roadmap for the project lifecycle by systematically implementing BIM in the building project. The major findings and pieces of evidence derived via the implementation support the conceptual framework. The following discussions explain how BIM disrupts the project from the view of organization design and clarify the contributions of this study in project management, as well as BIM adoption and integration. Finally, the conclusions focus on the development of this research, the role of the conceptual framework to underlie the BIM roadmap, and the research limitations.

What data is required by FM professionals in the operation and maintenance (OM) phases of facilities? The aim of this paper is to clarify the needs of FM professionals for maintenance purposes and to investigate potential areas that can use BIM technology to satisfy such data requirements. A survey was conducted to collect perspectives from industry practitioners for the data requirements for FM in the design and construction phases.

The time for a building owner to get involved with the BIM process is not at the end of the building project but from the very beginning. BIM for Building Owners and Developers is the only guide that will help you, the owner and client, use BIM to increase transparency and create a more integrated design and construction process, which will result in better quality buildings at lower cost and in a shorter time frame. It will also help you understand what BIM can do for you and what you can expect in terms of process and commitments.

Building systems have particularly long lifetimes as compared to other products or services. They are composed of elements that evolve over time and are characterized by time-dependent parameters. A literature review was performed in the aim of identifying the time-dependent characteristics of a building system at different levels: building technology level (e.g. technical performance degradations and technological innovations), end-user level (e.g. occupant behaviour) and external system level (e.g. infrastructures, energy mix, regulations). A new LCA framework including the time dimension, applied to a building system, is proposed. It involves operational and reproducible tools (computational software and databases) to perform effective temporal evaluations and incorporates dynamic Life Cycle Inventory (LCI, including the temporal evolution of a building system and of the related environment interventions, i.e. emissions and resource consumption) and dynamic Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA, climate change and toxicity). To integrate the specificities of buildings in dynamic LCI modelling, different existing assets (at national and international level) in the field of LCA are analysed. This work proposes an original methodology for performing a dynamic LCA of buildings using new tools still under development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052967400

Findings: Thereis a broad landscape ofresearch themes; yet,asignificant portionof the most-cited journal papers were published more than 10-15 years ago. Current debates are focused mostly on operational improvement; few are directed at more strategic objectives. Those in the informal media are concerned with more speculative themes, particularly the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), which are indicative of disruptive technology. These themes are debated mostly by practitioners. Originality/value: Many views are expressed in this editorial - some are controversial whilst others should be regarded as matters of fact. The underlying aim is to stimulate debate and action among readers about what appears to be a dilemma for the facility management sector and discipline.

What is new are the myriad ways they have to capture, analyze and apply the data that has been made readily available. Some practitioners and their organizations have balked at adding data to their repertoire, citing that they are unprepared to deal with data on top of everything else they have to contend with, including new technologies, work-processes and workflows. Data-centric organizations, on the other hand, have come to realize that capturing, engaging with, analyzing, and applying sustainability data in their projects is not ""one more thing,"" and have learned that to have the greatest impact, data cannot be added on top of an organization's on-going practices, but rather integrated into their pre-existing mind-sets and processes. This paper explores firms' approaches and relationships to data, determining whether organizations are data-enabled, data-informed or data driven, or a hybrid, and how their approach can have an enormous influence on outcomes, especially where they pertain to sustainability. Likewise, many organizations remain document-centric, and are missing out on opportunities and greater gains that come with becoming data-centric. Innovative tools and insights to make the most of the data are already readily available. What has been missing, up until now, is an understanding of how others - academics and industry practitioners - are innovating behind the scenes to exploit these resources to great impact. Big data and predictive analytics are currently being leveraged across the globe to address wicked - complex and poorly defined - problems endemic of design and construction in the 21st century. Innovative results in leveraging data throughout the building lifecycle are a result of original research for a new book, ""Data Driven Design and Construction: Strategies for Capturing, Analyzing and Applying Building Data,"" (John Wiley & Sons, 2015.) Methods of Research: Because data driven design impacts so many facets of the building lifecycle, the research for this paper attempted to be as inclusive as possible. Using practice-based research and in-depth interviews with industry and academic leaders, the author relied on many sources, including first-hand interviews with 40 thought leaders in industry and education in the AECO industry who work day-to-day with data; with firm leaders and other industry executives at companies that range in size from sole proprietorships to large multinational organizations.
