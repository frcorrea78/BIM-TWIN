This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors. The paper also proposes the definition of DT for Industry 4.0 manufacturing, elaborated by the European H2020 project MAYA, as a contribution to the research discussion about DT concept. © 2017 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029833606

An important prerequisite for smart manufacturing is cyber–physical integration, which is increasingly being embraced by manufacturers. As the preferred means of such integration, cyber–physical systems (CPS) and digital twins (DTs) have gained extensive attention from researchers and practitioners in industry. With feedback loops in which physical processes affect cyber parts and vice versa, CPS and DTs can endow manufacturing systems with greater efficiency, resilience, and intelligence. CPS and DTs share the same essential concepts of an intensive cyber–physical connection, real-time interaction, organization integration, and in-depth collaboration. However, CPS and DTs are not identical from many perspectives, including their origin, development, engineering practices, cyber–physical mapping, and core elements. In order to highlight the differences and correlation between them, this paper reviews and analyzes CPS and DTs from multiple perspectives. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068798049

Recently, researchers globally have been exploring the applications of BIM. In this work, a BIM-based model is designed to support fire safety management of buildings. The model comprises four modules - evacuation assessment, escape route planning, safety education, and equipment maintenance. The evacuation assessment module integrates BIM with a Fire Dynamics Simulator to calculate the required safety egress time and the available safety egress time to evaluate the ability to evacuate in case of fire. The escape route planning module utilizes BIM to determine whether the distance of an escape route is acceptable. The safety education module presents hazardous areas, videos of escape routes and directional maps, all in three dimensions, to educate the occupants of the building about fire safety. The equipment maintenance module is implemented in a web-based prototype to support maintenance tasks in a remote management manner. The results of applying BIM have demonstrated that BIM can effectively provide 3D geometric data to support the assessment and planning of fire safety (using the first three modules), and it can store information in support of safety management and property management in a web-based environment (using the equipment maintenance module). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944408053

This paper presents a performance analysis of a UWB positioning system as a material and activity tracking tool for indoor construction projects, with emphasis on field implementation and site validation. This research was designed in three phases and examined the performance deterioration of an UWB system in complete occlusion situations using timber and steel as blocking materials, analyzed the location dependency of UWB system error and investigated the potential for location based error modelling, and investigated the UWB system performance over the construction period of a progressively more heavily congested piping project. The statistical analysis of this research has produced confidence intervals for UWB system error in the various tested configurations to be used in future research. Also, the performance deterioration of the UWB system in an active construction environment has been quantified.

Evacuation path optimization has vital importance in reducing the human and social harm and saving the aid time. Significant research efforts have been made in the literature to deal with evacuation optimization on the basis of deterministic optimization model, nevertheless the stochastic aspects or uncertainty of real-world evacuation have not been taken into account comprehensively. Inspired by the promising performance of heuristic algorithms to solve combinatorial problems, this paper proposes an improved quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) for exhaustive optimization of the evacuation path that people can evacuate from hazardous areas to safe areas. In comparison with ACO (ant colony optimization) based method, QACA has the capability of finding a good solution faster using fewer individuals and possesses strong robustness, as a result of the quantum representation and updating of pheromone. Experiment results show that the proposed approach executes more effectively during evacuation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966454827

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

In Taiwan, about 100 firefighters die during fire rescues each year, primarily because they are unaware of the causes of the fire and unfamiliar with the location's environment. Meanwhile, evacuees often die in the panic of evacuation. To solve these problems, this research proposes a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based visualization and warning system for fire rescue. A fire dynamics simulator (FDS) simulates various conditions of structural fires in conjunction with the visualization and integration properties of BIM, and the simulation results for temperature, carbon monoxide, and visibility can be integrated and presented in the BIM model for briefing purposes before rescue operations begin. In addition, this research integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which allows real-time situation monitoring. In the event of a fire, the BIM model will immediately display the situation of the fire scene and control LED escape route pointers according to the actual situation. The primary objective of this system is to provide useful information to firefighters such that they can be aware of the fire's environment and create an effective rescue plan. Moreover, the automated LED escape route pointer may assist the building's occupants to escape, provide the firefighters with valuable information, and allow them quickly to discover hazards so that the number of casualties can be minimized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046800047

In this study, a dynamic path planning approach based on neural networks is proposed for evacuation planning in large public buildings. First, an automatic process to develop the evacuation analysis model with simplified but sufficient information is presented. Then a path generation algorithm is proposed, together with an evaluation process, to generate a number of training sets for policy neural networks. When the primary policy neural network is preliminarily trained, it falls into a self-learning iteration process. Finally, the approach embeds a dynamic algorithm to simulate the mutual influences among all occupants in the building. The neural network was trained according to a real large public building and then the approach managed to provide rapid and feasible evacuation guidance for both occupants to escape in multiple scenarios and managers to design the evacuation strategy.

Timely access to safe and efficient egress paths helps minimize exposure to hazardous fire effluents such as toxic smoke during evacuation. The following study develops a computational model which uses hazard prediction data to identify optimal evacuation routes, the safest and shortest paths to the nearest exit, during the event of a building fire. It uses the Fire Dynamics Simulator to provide prediction data on smoke propagation inside a structure and the A* algorithm to search for the fastest escape path. The algorithm is modified to consider whether the ensuing nodes in the route are in a normal or hazardous state. The test simulations demonstrate that the model is both accurate and effective in guiding evacuees to a place of safety while minimizing direct exposure to smoke.

It is difficult and dangerous for first responders to perform search and rescue in an unfamiliar environment, sometimes leading to secondary casualties. One way to reduce such hazards is to provide first responders with timely access to accurate location information. To address this challenge, the authors have developed a radio frequency based indoor localization framework, for which novel algorithms were designed for two different situations: one where an existing sensing infrastructure exists in buildings and one where an ad-hoc sensing infrastructure must be deployed. This paper presents a comparative assessment of this framework under different situations and emergency scenarios, and between simulations and field tests. The paper first presents an assessment of the framework in field tests, showing that it achieves room-level accuracies above 82.8% and 84.6% and coordinate-level accuracies above 2.29 m and 2.07 m, under the two situations, respectively. Moreover, the framework demonstrates considerable robustness in the tests, retaining a room-level accuracy of 70% or higher when the majority of sensing infrastructure is damaged. This paper then synthesizes results from both simulations and field tests, and demonstrates how the framework can be adapted to different situations and scenarios while consistently yielding satisfactory localization performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the existing floor field models mainly focus on the behavioral features based on the location of the exit and following others in the lead, but the influence of fire expansion and local congestion is not fully considered, resulting in the inability to precisely simulate the evacuation process in such scenarios. In reality, the moving directions of occupants are heavily dependent on the expansion of fire, while the moving needs of occupants are remarkably influenced by the congestion in the adjacent pedestrian flow. Correspondingly, in this paper, the fire scenario based moving direction is proposed to describe the moving direction affected by fire-induced panic; the pedestrian flow based expected velocity is proposed to address the moving need affected by local congestions, in a bid to modify the present models. The parameter analysis based on the proposed model indicates that the overall evacuation time and the average death toll vary when considering the scenario based moving intention and expected velocity; the overall evacuation time will be underestimated while the average death toll will be overestimated if these two behavior features are not incorporated. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Tongji University.
