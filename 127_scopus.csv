This review focuses on six substantial lines of research that have been pursued since 1997 that have helped elucidate our understanding about the effects of PM on human health. There has been substantial progress in the evaluation of PM health effects at different time-scales of exposure and in the exploration of the shape of the concentration-response function. There has also been emerging evidence of PM-related cardiovascular health effects and growing knowledge regarding interconnected general pathophysiological pathways that link PM exposure with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Despite important gaps in scientific knowledge and continued reasons for some skepticism, a comprehensive evaluation of the research findings provides persuasive evidence that exposure to fine particulate air pollution has adverse effects on cardiopulmonary health. Although much of this research has been motivated by environmental public health policy, these results have important scientific, medical, and public health implications that are broader than debates over legally mandated air quality standards. © 2006 Air & Waste Management Association.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745440031

The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914159642

This provides a whole new set of capabilities in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. However, the data generated by these platforms are often of questionable quality. We have conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 24 identical units of a commercial low-cost sensor platform against CEN (European Standardization Organization) reference analyzers, evaluating their measurement capability over time and a range of environmental conditions. Our results show that their performance varies spatially and temporally, as it depends on the atmospheric composition and the meteorological conditions. Our results show that the performance varies from unit to unit, which makes it necessary to examine the data quality of each node before its use. In general, guidance is lacking on how to test such sensor nodes and ensure adequate performance prior to marketing these platforms. We have implemented and tested diverse metrics in order to assess if the sensor can be employed for applications that require high accuracy (i.e., to meet the Data Quality Objectives defined in air quality legislation, epidemiological studies) or lower accuracy (i.e., to represent the pollution level on a coarse scale, for purposes such as awareness raising). Data quality is a pertinent concern, especially in citizen science applications, where citizens are collecting and interpreting the data.

However, most sensor systems have not been thoroughly evaluated with standardized calibration protocols, and their data quality is not well documented. In this work, three low-cost particle sensors based on light scattering (Shinyei PPD42NS, Samyoung DSM501A, and Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F) were evaluated by calibration methods adapted from the US EPA 2013 Air Sensor Workshop recommendations. With a SidePak (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA), a scanning mobility particle sizer (TSI Inc.), and an AirAssure™ PM2.5 Indoor Air Quality Monitor (TSI Inc.), which itself relies on a GP2Y1010AU0F sensor as reference instruments, six performance aspects were examined: Linearity of response, precision of measurement, limit of detection, dependence on particle composition, dependence on particle size, and relative humidity and temperature influences. This work found that: (a) all three sensors demonstrated high linearity against SidePak measured concentrations, with R2 values higher than 0.8914 in the particle concentration range of 0-1000 g/m3, and the linearity depended on the studied range of particle concentrations; (b) the standard deviations of the sensors varied from 15 to 90 g/m3 for a concentration range of 0-1000 g/m3; (c) the outputs of all three sensors depended highly on particle composition and size, resulting in as high as 10 times difference in the sensor outputs; and (d) humidity affected the sensor response.

Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008208903

However, the performance of the new generation of low-cost PM sensors under field conditions is not well understood. In this study, we characterized the performance capabilities of a new low-cost PM sensor model (Plantower model PMS3003) for measuring PM2.5 at 1 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h integration times. We tested the PMS3003 sensors in both low-concentration suburban regions (Durham and Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC, US) with 1 h PM2.5 (mean±SD) of 9±9 and 10±3-gm-3, respectively, and a high-concentration urban location (Kanpur, India) with 1 h PM2.5 of 36±17 and 116±57-gm-3 during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. In Durham and Kanpur, the sensors were compared to a research-grade instrument (environmental β attenuation monitor, E-BAM) to determine how these sensors perform across a range of PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological factors (e.g., temperature and relative humidity, RH). In RTP, the sensors were compared to three Federal Equivalent Methods (FEMs) including two Teledyne model T640s and a Thermo Scientific model 5030 SHARP to demonstrate the importance of the type of reference monitor selected for sensor calibration. The decrease in 1 h mean errors of the calibrated sensors using univariate linear models from Durham (201 %) to Kanpur monsoon (46 %) and post-monsoon (35 %) seasons showed that PMS3003 performance generally improved as ambient PM2.5 increased. The precision of reference instruments (T640: ±0:5-gm-3 for 1 h; SHARP: ±2-gm-3 for 24 h, better than the E-BAM) is critical in evaluating sensor performance, and β-attenuation-based monitors may not be ideal for testing PM sensors at low concentrations, as underscored by (1) the less dramatic error reduction over averaging times in RTP against optically based T640 (from 27% for 1 h to 9% for 24 h) than in Durham (from 201% to 15 %); (2) the lower errors in RTP than the Kanpur post-monsoon season (from 35% to 11 %); and (3) the higher T640-PMS3003 correlations (R2 ≥ 0:63) than SHARP-PMS3003 (R2 ≥ 0:25). A major RH influence was found in RTP (1 h RH = 64± 22 %) due to the relatively high precision of the T640 measurements that can explain up to ∼ 30% of the variance in 1 min to 6 h PMS3003 PM2.5 measurements. When proper RH corrections are made by empirical nonlinear equations after using a more precise reference method to calibrate the sensors, our work suggests that the PMS3003 sensors can measure PM2.5 concentrations within ∼ 10%of ambient values. We observed that PMS3003 sensors appeared to exhibit a nonlinear response when ambient PM2.5 exceeded ∼ 125-gm-3 and found that the quadratic fit is more appropriate than the univariate linear model to capture this nonlinearity and can further reduce errors by up to 11 %. Our results have substantial implications for how variability in ambient PM2.5 concentrations, reference monitor types, and meteorological factors can affect PMS3003 performance characterization. © Author(s) 2018.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052707129

The IDAD-Institute of Environment and Development Air Quality Mobile Laboratory was placed at an urban traffic location in the city centre of Aveiro to conduct continuous measurements with standard equipment and reference analysers for CO, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and precipitation. The comparison of the sensor data generated by different microsensor-systems installed side-by-side with reference analysers, contributes to the assessment of the performance and the accuracy of microsensor-systems in a real-world context, and supports their calibration and further development. The overall performance of the sensors in terms of their statistical metrics and measurement profile indicates significant differences in the results depending on the platform and on the sensors considered. In terms of pollutants, some promising results were observed for O3 (r2: 0.12–0.77), CO (r2: 0.53–0.87), and NO2 (r2: 0.02–0.89).

Deliquescent growth of particles and the formation of fog droplets in the atmosphere can lead to significant increases in particle number concentration (PNC) and mass concentrations reported by such sensors. We carried out a detailed study using a Plantower PMS1003 low-cost particle sensor, both in the laboratory and under actual ambient field conditions, to investigate its response to increasing humidity and the presence of fog in the air. We found significant increases in particle number and mass concentrations at relative humidity above about 75%. During a period of fog, the total PNC increased by 28%, while the PNC larger than 2.5 μm increased by over 50%. The PM10 concentration reported by the PMS1003 was 46% greater than that on the standard monitor with a charcoal dryer at the inlet. While there is a causal link between particle pollution and adverse health effects, the presence of water on the particles is not harmful to humans. Therefore, air quality standards for particles are specifically limited to solid particles and standard particle monitoring instruments are fitted with a heater or dryer at the inlet to remove all liquid material from the sample before the concentrations are measured. This study shows that it is important to understand that the results provided by low-cost particle sensors, such as the PMS1003, cannot be used to ascertain if air quality standards are being met. © Author(s) 2018.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052699528

Exposure levels often exceed exposure limits in the construction industry. The need for effective control measures is high, but the complex structure of the construction industry, the variability in sources of exposure and the frequent changes of worksite makes it difficult to implement even simple and potentially effective control measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of control measures for reducing quartz dust exposure and to assess the extent of their use. Full-shift respirable dust measurements (n = 61) and short-term measurements among construction workers were performed and results of a questionnaire study among 1335 construction workers were analysed. Full-shift measurements showed respirable quartz exposure levels up to 63 times the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) value (0.075 mg/m3). More than half of the measurements were above the MAC value. Control measures were not very strongly associated with the full-shift exposure estimates, but the short-term measurements showed large reduction factors (&gt;70%) when wet dust suppression or local exhaust ventilation was used. The effectiveness of control measures is potentially high, and a significant part of the construction worker population is indeed using them on a regular basis. Still, both the exposure study and questionnaire survey show that the use of respiratory protection is the most widely used preventive measure in the construction industry. Respiratory protection might not always reduce exposure sufficiently.

Historically, wearable aerosol monitors have proven to be expensive, noisy, and burdensome. The objective of this work was to develop a new type of wearable monitor, an ultrasonic personal aerosol sampler (UPAS), to overcome many of the technological limitations in personal exposure assessment. The UPAS is a time-integrated monitor that features a novel micropump that is virtually silent during operation. A suite of onboard environmental sensors integrated with this pump measure and record mass airflow (0.5–3.0 L/min, accurate within 5%), temperature, pressure, relative humidity, light intensity, and acceleration. Rapid development of the UPAS was made possible through recent advances in low-cost electronics, open-source programming platforms, and additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping. Interchangeable cyclone inlets provided a close match to the EPA PM2.5 mass criterion (within 5%) for device flows at either 1.0 or 2.0 L/min. Battery life varied from 23 to 45 hours depending on sample flow rate and selected filter media.

The Norm Activation Model is employed in this study to examine the awareness of consequences and self-responsibility of managers with regard to dust pollution control on construction sites. Managers' own experiences with dust outbreaks, type and size of the company and its commitment to dust pollution control are found to positively moderate the awareness of consequences of managers. Perception of dust pollution as a trivial and isolated event which leads to discomfort was found to have negative moderating effects on the responsibility for control. The view that dust pollution control is less important compared to other activities is also found to have a negative moderating effect. Water suppression emerged as the main dust control method employed by majority of contractors. Managers' self-responsibility is severely affected by the use of water as the main method of suppression because wastage of water is deemed to be environmentally damaging. In order to influence the behaviour of managers, construction companies should demonstrate a genuine commitment to dust control; recognize dust pollution control in environmental management plans and project management plans; implement regular monitoring; reduce over-reliance on water suppression; and use innovative dust pollution control techniques.

In this study, a wireless network of low-cost particle sensors that can be deployed indoors was developed. To overcome the well-known limitations of low sensitivity and poor signal quality associated with low-cost sensors, a sliding window and a low pass filter were developed to enhance the signal quality. Utility of the networked system with improved sensitivity was demonstrated by deploying it in a woodworking shop.

The proposed design consists of low hardware cost and calibration based on temperature and humidity sensing to achieve accurate processing of airborne dust density. Using commercial particulate matter sensors, a highly accurate air quality monitoring sensor was designed and calibrated using real world variations in humidity and temperature for indoor and outdoor applications. Furthermore, to provide a low-cost secure solution for real-time data transfer and monitoring, an onboard Bluetooth module with AES data encryption protocol was implemented. The wireless sensor was tested against a Dylos DC1100 Pro Air Quality Monitor, as well as an Alphasense OPC-N2 optical air quality monitoring sensor for accuracy. The sensor was also tested for reliability by comparing the sensor to an exact copy of itself under indoor and outdoor conditions. It was found that accurate measurements under real-world humid and temperature varying and dynamically changing conditions were achievable using the proposed sensor when compared to the commercially available sensors. In addition to accurate and reliable sensing, this sensor was designed to be wearable and perform real-time data collection and transmission, making it easy to collect and analyze data for air quality monitoring and real-time feedback in remote health monitoring applications.

Owing to increased interest in assessing personal and community exposures to PM, we evaluated the feasibility of employing a low-cost portable direct-reading instrument for measurement of ambient air PM exposure. A Dylos DC 1700 PM sensor was collocated with a Grimm 11-R in an urban residential area of Houston Texas. The 1-min averages of particle number concentrations for sizes between 0.5 and 2.5 µm (small size) and sizes larger than 2.5 µm (large size) from a DC 1700 were compared with the 1-min averages of PM2.5 (aerodynamic size less than 2.5 µm) and coarse PM (aerodynamic size between 2.5 and 10 µm) concentrations from a Grimm 11-R. We used a linear regression equation to convert DC 1700 number concentrations to mass concentrations, utilizing measurements from the Grimm 11-R. The estimated average DC 1700 PM2.5 concentration (13.2 ± 13.7 µg/m3) was similar to the average measured Grimm 11-R PM2.5 concentration (11.3 ± 15.1 µg/m3). The overall correlation (r2) for PM2.5 between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R was 0.778. The estimated average coarse PM concentration from the DC 1700 (5.6 ± 12.1 µg/m3) was also similar to that measured with the Grimm 11-R (4.8 ± 16.5 µg/m3) with an r2 of 0.481. The effects of relative humidity and particle size on the association between the DC 1700 and the Grimm 11-R results were also examined. The calculated PM mass concentrations from the DC 1700 were close to those measured with the Grimm 11-R when relative humidity was less than 60% for both PM2.5 and coarse PM. Particle size distribution was more important for the association of coarse PM between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R than it was for PM2.5. Implications: The performance of a low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensor was evaluated in an urban residential area. Both PM2.5 and coarse PM (PM10-2.5) mass concentrations were estimated using a DC1700 PM sensor.

Design: The study is an ecological study that used the year 2014 hourly ambient pollution data. Setting: The study was conducted in an industrial area located in Pretoria West, South Africa. The area accommodates a coal-fired power station, metallurgical industries such as a coke plant and a manganese smelter. Data and method: Estimate of possible health risks from exposure to airborne PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 was performed using the US Environmental Protection Agency human health risk assessment framework. A scenario-assessment approach where normal (average exposure) and worst-case (continuous exposure) scenarios were developed for intermediate (24-hour) and chronic (annual) exposure periods for different exposure groups (infants, children, adults). The normal acute (1-hour) exposure to these pollutants was also determined. Outcome measures Presence or absence of adverse health effects from exposure to airborne pollutants. Results: Average annual ambient concentration of PM10, NO2 and SO2 recorded was 48.3±43.4, 11.50±11.6 and 18.68±25.4 μg/m3, respectively, whereas the South African National Ambient Air Quality recommended 40, 40 and 50 μg/m3 for PM10, NO2 and SO2, respectively. Exposure to an hour's concentration of NO2, SO2, CO and O3, an 8-hour concentration of CO and O3, and a 24-hour concentration of PM10, NO2 and SO2 will not likely produce adverse effects to sensitive exposed groups. However, infants and children, rather than adults, are more likely to be affected. Moreover, for chronic annual exposure, PM10, NO2 and SO2 posed a health risk to sensitive individuals, with the severity of risk varying across exposed groups.

Herein, we assessed the impact of PM10 and PM2.5 arising from construction works in and around London. Measurements were carried out at 17 different monitoring stations around three construction sites between January 2002 and December 2013. Tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM 1400) and OSIRIS (2315) particle monitors were used to measure the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions in the 0.1-10 μm size range along with the ambient meteorological data. The data was analysed using bivariate concentration polar plots and k-means clustering techniques. Daily mean concentrations of PM10 were found to exceed the European Union target limit value of 50 μg m-3 at 11 monitoring stations but remained within the allowable 35 exceedences per year, except at two monitoring stations. In general, construction works were found to influence the downwind concentrations of PM10 relatively more than PM2.5. Splitting of the data between working (0800-1800 h; local time) and non-working (1800-0800 h) periods showed about 2.2-fold higher concentrations of PM10 during working hours when compared with non-working hours. However, these observations did not allow to conclude that this increase was from the construction site emissions. Together, the polar concentration plots and the k-means cluster analysis applied to a pair of monitoring stations across the construction sites (i.e. one in upwind and the other in downwind) confirmed the contribution of construction sources on the measured concentrations. Furthermore, pairing the monitoring stations downwind of the construction sites showed a logarithmic decrease (with R2 about 0.9) in the PM10 and PM2.5 concentration with distance. Our findings clearly indicate an impact of construction activities on the nearby downwind areas and a need for developing mitigation measures to limit their escape from the construction sites. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959330560

Among all construction pollutants, construction dust is the most significant pollutant that endangers human health. To expand the limited scope of studies on construction dust exposure, this study investigates current dust control practices in the construction industry in Hong Kong through dust monitoring data compilation. The database constructed and compiled by this study is larger than any other previous dust-related datasets in the construction industry in Hong Kong. A total of 837 samples are collected from 33 construction sites and 16 contractors, among which 783 valid samples are analyzed. Descriptive statistics are reported in terms of “construction process”, “trade”, “tools”, “data source type”, and “dust control measure”. Overall geometric mean for personal exposures are 0.314 (geometric standard deviations: 3.929)mg/m3 for respirable dust and 0.003 (geometric standard deviations: 5.105)mg/m3 for quartz concentration. It is found that the top three dust respirable exposures are from cement mixing, concrete breaking, and manual demolition, whereas grinding and rock breaking are recorded the two highest processes in terms of quartz exposure. Analytical results indicate that respiratory protection commonly used on construction sites is often inadequate for exposures encountered. Data variability within task and tool is large, with high exposures reported for a broad spectrum of tools. This study attains a large dataset to represent as many dust production construction activities as possible, determining the most influential factors for predicting dust exposure and evaluating the effectiveness of current dust control practices.

Methods - Full-shift personal exposure measurements were performed and samples were analysed for inhalable dust and its cement content. Exposure variability was modelled with linear mixed models. Results - Inhalable dust concentrations at the construction site ranged from 0.05 to 34 mg/m3, with a mean of 1.0 mg/m3. Average concentration for inhalable cement dust was 0.3 mg/m3 (GM; range 0.02-17 mg/m3). Levels in the ready-mix and pre-cast concrete plants were on average 0.5 mg/m3 (GM) for inhalable dust and 0.2 mg/m 3 (GM) for inhalable cement dust. Highest concentrations were measured in cement production, particularly during cleaning tasks (inhalable dust GM = 55 mg/m3; inhalable cement dust GM = 33 mg/m3) at which point the workers wore personal protective equipment. Elemental measurements showed highest but very variable cement percentages in the cement plant and very low percentages during reinforcement work and pouring. Most likely other sources were contributing to dust concentrations, particularly at the construction site. Within job groups, temporal variability in exposure concentrations generally outweighed differences in average concentrations between workers. 'Using a broom', 'outdoor wind speed' and 'presence of rain' were overall the most influential factors affecting inhalable (cement) dust exposure.

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. <br><br> The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized, solar powered, and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in-house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2.5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via short message service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum. <br><br> Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g., mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F, Sharp Electronic Co.) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision. © Author(s) 2018.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042635693

Air pollution and particulate matter have merged as a global challenge in recent years because of its growing health and socio-economic risks. The intensity and impacts of these risks have become more pronounced, especially in developing countries like Pakistan that lack adequate warning, protection, and management systems. Various epidemiological studies have linked poor air quality with different health disorders and increasing death rates. In Pakistan, mortality rates as a result of exposure to increased levels of air pollutants, especially particulate matter, are alarming. According to the World Bank's estimates, Pakistan's annual burden of disease from outdoor air pollution is responsible for around 22,000 premature adult deaths and 163,432 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost. The concentration of major air pollutants in Pakistan, such as NOx, O3, and SO2 have also been increasing significantly over the last two decades. Several studies are also reporting multiple instances of air quality around the major cities of Pakistan being consistently exceeding the national guidelines. During teh year 2019 PM2.5 cocnentrations in the city of Lahore revealed that almost every single day was in exceedance of the WHO and national air quality standards. Although the substantial effects of these rising pollutant concentrations in Pakistan have been stated in a few studies, however, the total extent, nature of contributing factors, and consequences remain inadequately understood. This study aims to use data available from monitoring stations, satellites, and literature to highlight the gaps in our understanding and emphasize the critical challenges associated with poor air quality faced in Pakistan. Topmost is the lack of air quality monitoring systems followed by poor initiatives by policymakers and enforcement agencies. A way forward while addressing these key challenges is also discussed, which focuses on the development of flexible monitoring, new technologies, and monitoring approaches in addition to communications among the various public, private agencies, and all relevant stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091759227

The custom-built system measures 10 indoor environmental conditions including pollutants: temperature, relative humidity, Particulate Matter (PM)2.5, PM10, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs). A residential unit and an educational office building was selected and monitored over a span of seven days. The recorded mean PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations were significantly higher in the residential unit compared to the office building. The mean NO2, SO2, and TVOC concentrations were comparatively similar for both locations. Spearman rank-order analysis displayed a strong correlation between particulate matter and SO2 for both residential unit and the office building while the latter depicted strong temperature and humidity correlation with O3, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 when compared to the former. © 2021 by the authors.

Buildings play a crucial role in smart cities and are closely related to people's health. Moreover, they are equally essential to meet sustainable objectives. People spend most of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor air quality has a critical impact on health and well-being. With the increasing population of elders, ambient-assisted living systems are required to promote occupational health and well-being. Furthermore, living environments must incorporate monitoring systems to detect unfavorable indoor quality scenarios in useful time. This paper reviews the current state of the art on indoor air quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks in the last five years (2014-2019). This document focuses on the architecture, microcontrollers, connectivity, and sensors used by these systems. The main contribution is to synthesize the existing body of knowledge and identify common threads and gaps that open up new significant and challenging future research directions. The results show that 57% of the indoor air quality monitoring systems are based on Arduino, 53% of the systems use Internet of Things, and WSN architectures represent 33%. The CO2 and PM monitoring sensors are the most monitored parameters in the analyzed literature, corresponding to 67% and 29%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085637811

Governments on behalf of the public assume part of the responsibilities for minimizing dust emissions on construction sites. However, the measures that are useful for governments to fulfill such a responsibility have not been explored explicitly in previous studies. The aim of this research is to map out China's practices in this area with the intention of filling the knowledge gap. Using a combination of research methods, five categories of governmental measures are proposed: technological, economic, supervisory, organizational, and assessment-based. Data from 37 major cities in China are collected for analysis. While the proposed categories of measures are demonstrated in China, the data analysis results show that governments prefer technological and organizational measures, and institutional guarantees and technological innovation are a prerequisite for dust-free construction. This research provides a comprehensive examination of construction dust control from the perspective of governments, and it can assist governments in improving the performance of dust management in the construction context. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052081777

Levels of RCS close to an emission source are measured but little is known about the wider ambient exposure from industry emissions or natural sources. The aim of this work is to report the RCS concentrations obtained from a variety of ambient environments using a new mobile respirable (PM4) sampler. A mobile battery powered high flow rate (52 L min−1) sampler was developed and evaluated for particulate aerosol sampling employing foams to select the respirable particle size fraction. Sampling was conducted in the United Kingdom at site boundaries surrounding seven urban construction and demolition and five sand quarry sites. These are compared with data from twelve urban aerosol samples and from repeat measurements from a base line study at a single rural site. The 50% particle size penetration (d50) through the foam was 4.3 μm. Over 85% of predict bias values were with ±10% of the respirable convention, which is based on a log normal curve. Results for RCS from all construction and quarry activities are generally low with a 95 th percentile of 11 μg m−3. Eighty percent of results were less than the health benchmark value of 3 μg m−3 used in some states in America for ambient concentrations. The power cutting of brick and the largest demolition activities gave the highest construction levels. Measured urban background RCS levels were typically below 0.3 μg m−3 and the median RCS level, at a rural background location, was 0.02 μg m−3. These reported ambient RCS concentrations may provide useful baseline values to assess the wider impact of fugitive, RCS containing, dust emissions into the wider environment. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044117826

This feasibility study analyzed if the constant measurements of indoor PM concentrations collected at every five minutes are meaningfully associated with the levels of 15 types of endocrine disruptors in urine samples collected three times a day from nine new breastfeeding mothers in Seoul, Korea. Some promising results are observed in terms of detecting cumulative effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on some phthalate metabolites (MnBP, MiBP, MiNP, MCOP, MEOHP and MEHHP), BPA and TCS, at least for some participants. The findings from this study are expected to provide valuable directions for guiding future studies that discover potential associations between indoor PM concentrations and exposure to endocrine disruptors, which is still far from the consensus in the literature. Such efforts should offer empirical and scientific evidences for designing technology-based early warning/alarm services and evidence-based interventions to mitigate the level of exposure to PM and endocrine disruptors in their living environments. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089545506
