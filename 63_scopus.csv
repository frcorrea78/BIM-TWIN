However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

The captured data is uploaded to cloud in real-time to process and analyse for decision support purposes for the involved site managers and workers. Visibility and traceability functions are developed with BIM and virtual reality (VR) technologies, through which managers can supervise the construction progress and approximate cost information in a real-time manner.

Failure to adequately manage risks may not only lead to difficulties in meeting project objectives but also influence land-use planning and urban spatial design in the future growth of cities. Due to the rapid development and adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and BIM-related digital technologies, the use of these technologies for risk management has become a growing research trend leading to a demand for a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of these developments. This paper presents a summary of traditional risk management, and a comprehensive and extensive review of published literature concerning the latest efforts of managing risk using technologies, such as BIM, automatic rule checking, knowledge based systems, reactive and proactive IT (information technology)-based safety systems. The findings show that BIM could not only be utilised to support the project development process as a systematic risk management tool, but it could also serve as a core data generator and platform to allow other BIM-based tools to perform further risk analysis. Most of the current efforts have concentrated on investigating technical developments, and the management of construction personnel safety has been the main interest so far. Because of existing technical limitations and the lack of “human factor” testing, BIM-based risk management has not been commonly used in real environments. In order to overcome this gap, future research is proposed that should: (1) have a multi-disciplinary system-thinking, (2) investigate implementation methods and processes, (3) integrate traditional risk management with new technologies, and (4) support the development process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955321043

Occupational incidents occur in steel plant mainly in form of injury, near miss, and property damage or in combination. Different factors are responsible for such incidents to occur. An incident investigation scheme is proposed. Association rule mining approach is used to discover cause-and-affect patterns (rules) using 843 incidents. Thirty-five meaningful association rules are extracted using three criteria, support (S), confidence (C) and lift (L). For example, the results show that unsafe acts done by others are more frequent in injury cases (S= 4.86%, C= 78.8%, L= 2.3). Similarly, one of the SOP (standard operating procedures) related rule: 'SOP required, available, adequate but not complied' led to property damage (S= 11.03%, C= 49.2%, L= 1.525). Another useful rule 'SOP required, available but inadequate, followed' led to near miss (S= 1.66%, C= 38.89%, L= 1.163).

Modular/prefabricated building construction is a construction strategy that involves manufacturing of the whole building or some of its components off-site. This research focuses on the safety performance of the modular/prefabricated building construction sector during both manufacturing and on-site processes. This safety evaluation can serve as the starting point for improving the safety performance of this sector. Research was conducted based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated accidents. The study found 125 accidents related to modular/prefabricated building construction. The details of each accident were closely examined to identify the types of injury and underlying causes. Out of 125 accidents, there were 48 fatalities (38.4%), 63 hospitalized injuries (50.4%), and 14 non-hospitalized injuries (11.2%). It was found that, the most common type of injury in modular/prefabricated construction was ‘fracture’, and the most common cause of accidents was ‘fall’. The most frequent cause of cause (underlying and root cause) was ‘unstable structure’. In this research, the accidents were also examined in terms of corresponding location, occupation, equipment as well as activities during which the accidents occurred. For improving safety records of the modular/prefabricated construction sector, this study recommends that future research be conducted on stabilizing structures during their lifting, storing, and permanent installation, securing fall protection systems during on-site assembly of components while working from heights, and developing training programmes and standards focused on modular/prefabricated construction. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933073977

In real-world applications, transactions are changed whether insertion or deletion in a dynamic database. An existing maintenance approach for handling high-utility itemsets in dynamic databases with transaction deletion must rescan the database when necessary. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, called PRE-HUI-DEL, for updating high-utility itemsets based on the pre-large concept for transaction deletion is proposed. The pre-large concept is used to partition transaction-weighted utilization itemsets into three sets with nine cases according to whether they have large (high), pre-large, or small transaction-weighted utilization in the original database and in the deleted transactions.

However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

Wuhan Metro's Sanyang road tunnel, which crosses the Yangtze River in China, was selected for this case study. A slurry shield machine with a cutter diameter of 15.76 m was designed to be hoisted for 44 m into the underground tunnel shafts. The major challenges of this hoisting were as follows: 1) complex construction environment for hoisting, 2) limited visibility of crane operator or blind hoisting, and 3) precise control of position and gesture of a giant cutter wheel in real time. To overcome these challenges, the CPS-SMS was proposed to simulate and monitor the hoisting process to avoid the unsafe status of cranes and the hoisted cutter wheel. Internet-of-things technologies, such as wireless sensor-based location and tracking, self-organized Wi-Fi, and bi-directional communication, were used to prevent accidents in the changing and dynamic hoisting process. The implementation of monitoring blind hoist in the Yangtze River, which crosses the metro tunnel construction site, was successful, that is, no collision or injury occurred. The CPS-SMS can be applied by practitioners to various construction projects, such as dams, high-rise buildings, and large-scale infrastructure projects, to decrease the likelihood of safety risks in blind hoisting in complex environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056508559

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions.

This study proposes a multi-server information-sharing approach on a private cloud after analyzing the requirements for cross-party collaboration to address the aforementioned issues and prepare for massive data handling in the near future. This approach adopts a global controller to track the location, ownership and privacy of the data, which are stored in different servers that are controlled by different parties. Furthermore, data consistency conventions, parallel sub-model extraction, and sub-model integration with model verification are investigated in depth to support information sharing in a distributed environment and to maintain data consistency. Thus, with this approach, the ownership and privacy of the data can be controlled by its owner while still enabling certain required data to be shared with other parties. Application of the multi-server approach for information interoperability and cross-party collaboration is illustrated using a real construction project of an airport terminal.

A new method is proposed through risk coupling. First, the meaning of risk coupling of a gas explosion is defined, and types of risk coupling are classified. Next, the coupled relationship and coupled effects among risk factors are ex-plored through combining the interpretative structural modeling (ISM) and the NK model. Twenty-eight representative risk factors and 16 coupled types of risk factors are obtained through analysis of 332 gas explosion accidents in coal mines in China. Through the application of the combined ISM–NK model, an eight-level hierarchical model of risk coupling of a gas explosion accident is established, and the coupled degrees of different types of risk coupling are assessed. The hierarchical model reveals that two of the 28 risk factors, such as state policies, laws, and regulations, are the root risk factors for gas explosions; nine of the 28 risk factors, such as flame from blasting, electric spark, and local gas accumulation, are direct causes of gas explosions; whereas 17 of the risk factors, such as three-violation actions, ventilation system, and safety management, are indirect ones.

However, difficulties in time-dependent structural modeling and data fragmentation of different engineering and management systems remain unresolved, hindering the plan, do, check, and adjust (PDCA) loop for structural safety management during bridge construction. In this paper, an integrated framework for closed-loop management of structural safety based on multisource data integration is presented. The proposed framework consists of a bridge safety information model (BrSIM), algorithms for data integration and semi-automatic time-dependent structural model generation, and methods for structural safety warning and assessment. The proposed BrSIM and algorithms integrate data related to 3D products, schedule, structural simulation and monitoring from various engineering systems, which covers the main data for structural safety management during construction. Meanwhile, automatic calculation and generation of static loads and constraints of a structural model based on 3D product information and monitoring data are also considered. Demonstration in the construction of a long-span bridge shows that with the proposed framework, it is possible to visualize the construction process, generate time-dependent structural models and simulate, monitor and assess the structural safety dynamically.

Connectivity and betweenness centrality distributions are calculated and found to be scale-free, with respective exponents γ and δ.

Previous risk assessment frameworks for rail infrastructure have ignored the effects of risk interactions that inflate risk levels, namely, risk coupling effects. Based on a system dynamics method, this paper develops a risk coupling model for HSR project risk assessments. A risk factor list is established from a literature review, and relationships analysed using a case study and expert interviews. System dynamics equations are constructed and their parameters obtained by expert evaluations of risk factors. The proposed model is applied to a real-world HSR project to demonstrate it in detail. The model can evaluate the risk levels of HSR projects during a simulation period. In particular, it can identify the key coupling effects that are the main increased risk. It provides a significant resource, using which HSR project managers can identify and mitigate risks. © 2020 by the authors.

Building information modelling (BIM) serves as a powerful tool in facilitating on-site assembly services (OAS). However, challenges still exist in deploying BIM owing to inefficient data capture methods, inadequate progress monitoring, and a lack of automatic decision support. This paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart BIM platform (SBIMP) for OAS by integrating IoT, BIM, and computing technologies to address these issues. A trial project located in Hong Kong was deeply investigated and probed to develop the platform. Smart construction objects (SCOs) equipped with STT and GPS sensors were defined and configured to enable an efficient and reliable data collection process. The smart gateway system prompted seamless and timely information sharing and interchange among different stakeholders, thereby supporting the decision-making process.

Therefore, based on the previous prediction and early warning studies, this study chose the methods of correlation analysis and nonlinear modeling to scientifically predict and warn ATCers’ unsafe acts. Firstly, according to the process of association rule mining, the association rules among risk factors and controllers' unsafe acts were mined. On the basis of association rule mining, the prediction and early warning model was established by random forest algorithm. The prediction data samples were used to predict ATCers' errors and violations respectively. The results show that the number of two-dimensional association rules is the largest, followed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional association rules, and four-dimensional association rules is the least. For the prediction of errors and violations, the deviation between the predicted value and actual value is small, indicating that the prediction accuracy is high. Business ability, technical environment, inadequate supervision and mental states are of greater importance to the prediction of errors, while inadequate supervision, organizational climate, organizational process and mental states are more important for the prediction of violations. The application of association rule and random forest model can effectively predict ATCers' errors and violations, and send signals to relevant departments according to the threshold and alarm level to report dangerous situations, thus reducing the losses caused by ATCers' unsafe acts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098735488

Then, formation mechanism of the coupled disaster risk was discussed by triggers in physics, and the coupled effects and formation mechanism were illustrated, respectively. The complete basic theory on coupled disaster risk not only lays the theoretical foundation for the further study of coupled risk assessment, but also provides the countermeasures and suggestions for disaster prevention and mitigation, i. e., strong coupled effects should be turned into zero coupled effects or weak coupled effects through fundamental removing or weakening the conditions of coupled risk.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881181455

While safety looks to the construction workers need to work in a safe environment, productivity affects the project’s profitability and is of a paramount importance from the project owner’s view. The different perspective to the safety and productivity from these two major players in construction projects poses a potential for the conflict between the two. This problem can be fundamentally addressed by methods concurrently improving project safety and productivity. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To this aim, a discrete event simulation (DES) based framework applicable was proposed for complex and hazardous operations. The utility of the framework was tested using a case study of an eight-story residential building in the north-east part of Tehran, Iran. The excavation and stabilization operation was identified as the most hazardous and critical operation in this case. The framework could improve safety and productivity of this operation by 38 and 4 percent, respectively. Findings: This framework is a complement to the conventional construction project safety and productivity planning methods. Its main application is in complex and hazardous construction operations. Originality/value: For the first time, a comprehensive framework for concurrently improving safety and productivity of an entire project was proposed in this research. DES was used as the main modeling tool in the framework to provide an ex-ante evaluation foundation applicable to a wide range of construction projects. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053058707

Comparing accumulated settlement with threshold to evaluate settlement risk is insufficiently accurate. Thus, identifying the location and change in the settlement risk is difficult. This research develops a data-based complex network approach to analyze and assess the risks of surrounding environments from a synthetic and dynamic perspective based on settlement data and address these limitations. In the proposed approach, a complex network is divided into multiple time windows, from which temporal dynamics of settlement can be captured. Then, betweenness centrality is used to describe the spatial distributions of settlement risk, and network entropy is used to quantify the evolution of settlement risk. A case of Wuhan metro project in China is used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the developed approach. Results demonstrated that the developed approach can reveal spatio–temporal evolution law of settlement risks of surrounding environments. The developed method not only offers a systematic way to interpret settlement risk of surrounding environment in underground construction but also has the potential to improve safety performance in construction sites. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086574544

The result shows that gas explosion accidents are the consequence of stepping mutation from the nonlinear coupling between micro risk factors to macro hierarchical structural state, and the more the number of coupled risk factors is, the easier the gas explosion accidents are triggered.
