We intend to use laser scanning to detect changes on building sites or inside facilities, mainly for monitoring purposes but also to be able to provide synthetic information in case of an emergency. In both cases, the main constraint is time. A minimum precision on the measure of movements is also required, depending on the type of application. Laser scanner seems to be the perfect tool for such applications as it quickly acquires a large amount of accurate 3D data. But the comparison of so huge datasets implies the use of appropriate structures and ad-hoc algorithms. A specific octree structure is described, and then several simple cloud-to-cloud comparison techniques are presented. The best one, based on the Hausdorff distance computation is improved on various points. Also, as a full automatic process seems still unachievable, a software framework has been developed. It intends to minimize human intervention and therefore prevents from wasting the LiDAR speed in time-consuming post-processing operations. © 2005 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research. © 2020 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082386834

State-of-the-art photogrammetry and machine learning based feature detection methods are employed to automatically compute high-resolution geo-referenced 3D structural geometries and to identify typical damage patterns such as cracks. Further framework components dedicated to condition assessment allow the mapping of damages to structural parts and the calibration of mechanical numerical simulation models used to compute the internal structural demand under design loads. Data models are proposed that allow a consistent data storage and management to serve as a basis for all algorithmic components.

For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits.

A convolutional autoencoder was trained as a reconstruction-based model, with the defect-free images, to rapidly and reliably detect defects from the large volume of image datasets. This training process was in the unsupervised mode, with no label needed, thereby requiring no prior knowledge and saving an enormous amount of time for label preparation. The built anomaly detector favors minimizing the reconstruction errors of defect-free images, which renders high reconstruction errors of defects, in turn, detecting the location of defects. The assessment shows that the proposed anomaly detection technique is robust and adaptable to defects on wide ranges of scales. Comparison was also made with the segmentation results produced by other automatic classical methods, revealing that the results made by the anomaly map outperform other segmentation methods, in terms of precision, recall, F1 measure and F2 measure, without severe under- and over-segmentation. Further, instead of merely being a binary map, each pixel of the anomaly map is represented by the anomaly score, which acts as a risk indicator for alerting inspectors, wherever defects on concrete structures are detected. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083812356

The status of this infrastructure needs to be monitored on a continuous basis in order to ensure its safety and functionality. This is currently being done by authorities worldwide via bridge inspection reports. The format and storage of these reports varies considerably across different authorities around the world and is sometimes compiled into a bridge management system (BMS). The lack of standardization severely hinders the use of inspection information for knowledge-generation use cases by both practitioners and researchers. This paper presents an exploratory analysis, and as a result, an information model and a candidate binding to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to categorize inspection information on RC bridges and to standardize storage of this information in a format suitable for sharing and comparing it between different users and varying requirements. The authors were able to show in three steps that IFC in its latest version provides sufficient functionality to serve as a basis for integrating relevant defect information and imagery. First, types of defects and properties needed for bridge assessment were extracted from existing bridge inspection manuals. Second, the authors modeled the defect entities, their properties, and their relationships, and third, mapped them to appropriate IFC entities.

This damage may influence the performance of the bridge and reduce its load carrying capacity. This paper proposes a new method to quantify past support movements by investigating distortions in bridge geometry. In this method, the bridge geometry is recorded in point cloud format and segmented into different structural components (e.g. 3D piers and barrels or 2D pier and barrel cross-sections). The geometry of each component is investigated further by fitting primitive shapes (e.g. 3D planes and cylinders or 2D lines and arcs) which represent the design intent. The discrepancy between these fitted shapes and the point clouds reveals a characteristic distortion signature. This signature is compared with theoretical distortion traces, which are obtained from kinematical analyses of the arch subjected to a range of support movements. The most likely support movement scenarios identified from these comparisons are then validated with visual indications of damage, such as crack location and size, and other geometric quantities, such as the change of the bedding joint elevations along the bridge. The proposed technique is applied to two masonry rail viaducts in the UK, which demonstrate different evidence of damage. Using the proposed method, past support movements of both bridges, which led to the observed damage, are inferred. © 2018 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049748965

In this paper, a framework for autonomous bridge inspection using a UAV is proposed with a four-step workflow: (a) data acquisition with an efficient UAV flight path, (b) computer vision comprising training, testing and validation of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), (c) point cloud generation using intelligent hierarchical dense structure from motion (DSfM), and (d) damage quantification. This workflow starts with planning the most efficient flight path that allows for capturing of the minimum number of images required to achieve the maximum accuracy for the desired defect size, then followed by bridge and damage recognition. Three types of autonomous detection are used: masking the background of the images, detecting areas of potential damage, and pixel-wise damage segmentation. Detection of bridge components by masking extraneous parts of the image, such as vegetation, sky, roads or rivers, can improve the 3D reconstruction in the feature detection and matching stages. In addition, detecting damaged areas involves the UAV capturing close-range images of these critical regions, and damage segmentation facilitates damage quantification using 2D images. By application of DSfM, a denser and more accurate point cloud can be generated for these detected areas, and aligned to the overall point cloud to create a digital model of the bridge. Then, this generated point cloud is evaluated in terms of outlier noise, and surface deviation. Finally, damage that has been detected is quantified and verified, based on the point cloud generated using the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) method. The results indicate this workflow for autonomous bridge inspection has potential. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

To determine the load bearing capacity for the current state and to predict the structural behaviour for the future life span, regular inspections and evaluations of the structural condition are required. Recently, many different approaches using modern digital technologies were developed to support the engineer with the acquisition and interpretation of structural information. This article focuses on the evaluation of visual data acquired by using small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) equipped with high-quality cameras. The images obtained are used amongst others to reconstruct a dense 3D point cloud, which contains local (e.g. cross sectional shape, spalling areas) as well as global (e.g. bending line with respect to a reference condition or to earlier observation) geometric information. Furthermore, surface anomalies (e.g. cracks), automatically detected by image analysis algorithms, are mapped to the 3D structure. This paper presents a methodology, which processes and combines the acquired data from consecutive UAS-based inspections to quantify identifiable parameters usable for a validation or calibration of a numerical model. This parameters cover for example cross sectional values, displacements and curvature at each position of the element axis as well as magnitudes of load and effective bending stiffness. The introduced procedure systematically shows on different structural levels and based on the number of data acquisitions and available a priori information about the structure which parameters are identifiable and how they are obtained. The quantification is performed by a combination of mathematical optimization strategies with linked cross sectional and system analysis.

This allows for the automation of condition assessment processes to locate, quantify and predict damage progression at a structure related to building information models. However, the usual inspection documentation as performed in the past neither includes an assignment of damages to digital building models nor relates the history of recordings to a damage entity, which consequently makes a direct condition state comparison unfeasible. The paper presents voxel based methods for the automated assignment of geometrical representations of damages to elements of a corresponding building model as well as to past damage scans, which describe the same damage entity. Furthermore, the comparison and computation of discrete geometric changes based on the assignments is shown. Additionally, the clustering of scanned damage geometries into interest areas for the usage in planning processes for further inspections is presented. The resulting set of methods enables an automated condition comparison of damages on each surveyed state of the structure and supports the integration of inspection data to building information models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096095143
