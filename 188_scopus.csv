However, critics claim that it means many different things to different people. This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept. © 2017 The Author(s)",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029397642

However the concept of circularity is not of novel as such. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. Main objectives of this work are: to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of resources scarcity, waste generation and economic advantages; to explore the CE landscape in the context of these three aspects especially when they are considered simultaneously; based on an idea of a comprehensive CE framework, propose an implementation strategy using top-down and bottom-up approach in a concurrent manner. To fulfill this objective a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research is carried out to understand different ideas relevant to CE, motivation for the research and context of their recurrence. Main contributions of this paper are a comprehensive CE framework and a practical implementation strategy for a regenerative economy and natural environment. The framework emphasizes on a combined view of three main aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic benefits. It also underlines that joint support of all stakeholders is necessary in order to successfully implement the CE concept at large scale. The proposed framework and implementation strategy also identify new avenues for future research and practice in the field of CE. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957849870

This paper synthesises core principles and linked best practices for the management of construction and demolition waste across the entire construction value chain.

To deal with these challenges, an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled platform is designed by integrating IoT and BIM for prefabricated public housing projects in Hong Kong. The demands of the stakeholders were analysed; then smart construction objects (SCOs) and smart gateway are defined and designed to collect real-time data throughout the working processes of on-site assembly of prefabricated construction using the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The captured data is uploaded to cloud in real-time to process and analyse for decision support purposes for the involved site managers and workers. Visibility and traceability functions are developed with BIM and virtual reality (VR) technologies, through which managers can supervise the construction progress and approximate cost information in a real-time manner.

BIM can be utilized as a less expensive, virtual, and computational environment to enable designers to ponder different design options, or contractors to evaluate different construction schemes, both with a view to minimizing construction waste generation. However, existing debate on this topic too frequently treats BIM as a cure-all silver bullet; without some major hurdles being adequately addressed, the applications of BIM will remain rhetorical. This paper aims to demystify BIM's computational application to CWM. Based on a critical literature review, a prototypical framework of a computational BIM for CWM is delineated, within which the two key prerequisites of ‘information readiness’ and ‘computational algorithms’ are highlighted. Then, the paper details the required information and how it can be organized in a standalone database or encapsulated in existing BIM for CWM. Learning from the historical development of data infrastructure in the field of BIM-based cost management, the process to develop the required information is likely to be tortuous but is unavoidable. The paper further explores computational BIM algorithms that can manipulate the information to facilitate decision-making for CWM. Finally, the operation of computational BIM is elaborated by relating it to various prevailing procurement models within which BIM applications are contextualized. Although the framework reported here has been substantially developed for experimental application, it is not to be taken as an immediately applicable solution but rather as an illustration of the kind of platform on which future development of computational BIM for CWM can proceed in a more efficient and effective fashion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993990049

This paper compares the cost of residential building deconstruction with the cost of demolition in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The comparative cost analysis is developed by systematically analyzing two separate residential deconstruction projects previously reported in other studies and augmenting with up-to-date cost data for Massachusetts. The study shows that under current conditions in Massachusetts, deconstruction costs could be 17-25% higher than demolition costs. The analysis further identifies and ranks the parameters affecting these costs. These parameters, in the order of their impact on costs are: labor cost (either productivity or hourly rate), disposal cost (tipping fee and transportation), and resale value of deconstructed materials. A sensitivity analysis is used to identify the break-even points for these parameters such that deconstruction becomes economically competitive with demolition. This study demonstrates an approach for planners of waste management programs to evaluate and develop strategies for promoting C&D waste reduction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the tremendous resources spent to combat it, the surreptitious nature of illegal dumping indicates the extreme difficulty in its identification. In 2006, the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme (CWDCS) was implemented, regulating that all construction waste must be disposed of at government waste facilities if not otherwise properly reused or recycled. While the CWDCS has significantly improved construction waste management in Hong Kong, it has also triggered illegal dumping problems. Inspired by the success of big data in combating urban crime, this paper aims to identify illegal dumping cases by mining a publicly available data set containing more than 9 million waste disposal records from 2011 to 2017. Using behavioral indicators and up-to-date big data analytics, possible drivers for illegal dumping (e.g., long queuing times) were identified. The analytical results also produced a list of 546 waste hauling trucks suspected of involvement in illegal dumping. This paper contributes to the understanding of illegal dumping behavior and joins the global research community in exploring the value of big data, particularly for combating urban crime.

Much of this waste is not reused or recycled and is subsequently redirected to landfills. The environmental impact of construction waste (CW) generation and the shortage of land resources for the creation of new landfills have reinforced the need to adopt more innovative CW management practices. Estimation of CW is a necessary step for the adoption of CW management practices. In this study, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used to automate CW quantification. In this context, CW generation is estimated as the materials purchased but not incorporated into the actual building structure. Algorithms developed to quantify concrete and drywall waste streams are presented to demonstrate the proposed CW estimation method. The proposed concrete algorithm is validated by comparing estimated waste to actual waste data reported in the waste hauling tickets of a real-world project. Furthermore, CW generation quantities reported in the literature are used to validate estimates of both concrete and drywall waste streams. By leveraging material quantities directly from BIM—as opposed to manual estimations—CW estimation can be streamlined, enabling decision makers to implement more efficient construction waste management practices in the field. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063084462

In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings’ end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system.

Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind.

The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an example of this. BIM is emergent technology commonly used to maximize the efficiency of design, construction and maintenance throughout the entire lifecycle.

Therefore, there are limitations in the existing literature for estimating DW with a consistent classification system. Building information modeling (BIM) is a technology that can generate and manage all the information required during the life cycle of a building, from design to demolition. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of research regarding its application to the demolition stage of a building. For an effective waste management plan, the estimation of the type and volume of DW should begin from the building design stage. However, the lack of tools hinders an early estimation. This study proposes a BIM-based framework that estimates DW in the early design stages, to achieve an effective and streamlined planning, processing, and management. Specifically, the input of construction materials in the Korean construction classification system and those in the BIM library were matched. Based on this matching integration, the estimates of DW by type were calculated by applying the weight/unit volume factors and the rates of DW volume change. To verify the framework, its operation was demonstrated by means of an actual BIM modeling and by comparing its results with those available in the literature.

The reuse of existing building components could support this goal. However, it is difficult to reclaimcomponents from demolition, and materials remain cheap compared with labour, so new approaches are needed for reuse to be implemented beyond niche projects. This study therefore reviews waste interventions. Multiple case studies, spanning new builds and refurbishment, were undertaken to examine systemic mechanisms that lead to components being discarded. Evidence from fieldwork observations, waste documentation, and interviews indicates that the generators of unwanted components effectively decide their fate, and a failure to identify components in advance, uncertainty over usefulness, the perception of cost and programme risk in reclamation, and the preferential order of the waste hierarchy mean that the decision to discard to waste management goes unchallenged. A triage process is proposed to capture timely information about existing building components to be discarded, make this information visible to a wide community, and determine usefulness by focusing creativity already present in the industry on an exhaustive examination of component reusability and upcyclability. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040794271

This makes it more complex to train building occupants in order to acquire skills that align to best practices for immediate earthquake response and post-earthquake evacuation. In recent years, Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and Serious Games (SGs) have become popular as training tools for earthquake emergencies. IVR SGs have been introduced to train individuals for specific building layouts or settings with fixed training objectives. However, the lack of flexibility in existing IVR SGs makes it challenging to have widespread uptake as trainees require different training objectives, pedagogical strategies, context, and content. As a result, the effectiveness of IVR SGs training is jeopardized if the customization ability is limited. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a customization framework for IVR SGs suited to earthquake emergency training, using the concept of adaptive game-based learning. Trainees can receive training in context by customizing virtual environments, storylines, and teaching methods. A case study was undertaken to validate the proposed framework.

The dynamic assessment of demolition, collision and mechanical impact was measured through computerised 4D motion game and physics engines. Waste recovery and treatment complemented the simulation algorithm. The simulation of the information workflow was tested through case study using two demolition strategies. Findings: The simulation successfully estimated the efficiency and efficacy of the different demolition strategies. Thus, simulation results can potentially support better decision making related to the definition of demolition strategies associated with recycling and re-use targets. Research limitations/implications: The simulation was limited to a simple machine-led demolition strategy.

In this respect, the use of 4D-CAD for efficient resource management and control is an area with great potential that has not been explored extensively. Current applications have shown positive results. For instance, the optimal install timings of building elements in construction can be suggested by connecting the construction process with digital objects to automate project visualization by means of animation. Thus, the potential for identifying inefficient planning solutions increases and improvement can be suggested. In addition, project progress can be monitored and managed through the whole construction process by comparing planning with as-build, In this study, 4D-CAD was adopted for demolition project planning. In this respect, process simulation was used as an additional support to decision-making that is often reliant on experience. For that, the volume of generated waste and the optimal timing of resource movement were estimated quantitatively with 4D-CAD. Blender, a free 4D-CAD software, was used to develop an impact simulation tool for demolition projects. Physics and game engines were used to automatically simulate demolition in accordance with physics laws. In addition, Python programming was used in the development of a Graphical User Interphase (GUI). Simulation results for the time-lapsed impact change from two variables; i) machine use and ii) waste generation. Animation recorded in simulation is also useful for better understanding of users as a visual aid. The testing of the tool involved the simulated demolition of a five-story building model created through BIM. Variables assessed included machine productivity for different demolition strategies and time-lapse change of waste generated. Time-lapse results of machinery productivity reveal the (in)efficiencies of different demolition processes. Waste generation data is classified by original (material) types and location; Waste distribution and purity levels are displayed on a demolition site map that forms the basis of a multi-factor waste recovery plan (e.g. machine transportation routes, collection order and timing). This process supports the definition of waste collection methods with increase purity levels and waste recovery rates. Limitations of the research includes the use of a simplified demolition method (e.g. single demolition machine and free-fall collapse). In summary, the aim of this research is to enhance the recycling levels of demolition waste within construction. For that purpose, a simulation tool was developed to estimate and qualify waste from building demolition using BIM enabled 4D-CAD combined with physics and game engines. The studied variables were machinery impact and waste output within alternative demolition processes. In addition, Waste Distribution Maps (WDM) are generated to support decision-making. This research represents a significant advancement in applied computing for building demolition waste recycling and notably improves the quality of information available in the definition of building demolition strategies. Further steps of the research include to increase the level of precision of the impact analysis, waste distribution and waste purity to levels that support after demolition waste treatment decision-making. © 2018 Architectural Institute of Japan.
