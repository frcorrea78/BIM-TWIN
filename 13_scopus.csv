Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability of resources, and ""map"" of the respective supply chains visually.

However, it is evident that over 75 % of what the construction industry generates as waste has a residual value, and therefore could be recycled, salvaged and/or reused. The need for comprehensive and integrated waste management mechanisms, technologies, rating systems and policies is widely recognized. Owing to increasing C&D waste volumes, shortage of landfills and long-term adverse environmental, economic and social impacts of the disposed C&D waste, sustainable C&D waste management is becoming increasingly essential to protect public health and natural ecosystems. This paper proposes a conceptual C&D waste management framework to maximise the 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) and minimise the disposal of construction waste by implementing sustainable and comprehensive strategy throughout the lifecycle of construction projects. In addition, a life cycle based C&D waste sustainability index is developed. This approach can be used to make decisions related to selection of material, sorting, recycle/reuse and treatment or disposal options for C&D waste. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873096527

One approach for improving the situation is using lean construction. Lean construction results from the application of a new form of production management to construction. Essential features of lean construction include a clear set of objectives for the delivery process, aimed at maximizing performance for the customer at the project level, concurrent design, construction, and the application of project control throughout the life cycle of the project from design to delivery. An increasing number of construction academics and professionals have been storming the ramparts of conventional construction management in an effort to deliver better value to owners while making real profits. As a result, lean-based tools have emerged and have been successfully applied to simple and complex construction projects. In general, lean construction projects are easier to manage, safer, completed sooner, and cost less and are of better quality. Significant research remains to complete the translation to construction of lean thinking in Egypt. This research will discuss principles, methods, and implementation phases of lean construction showing the waste in construction and how it could be minimized. The Last Planner System technique, which is an important application of the lean construction concepts and methodologies and is more prevalent, proved that it could enhance the construction management practices in various aspects.

The last two decades have witnessed the growing importance of demolition and renovation (D&R) works and the growing amount of D&R waste disposed to landfills every day, especially in developed cities like Hong Kong. Quantitative waste prediction is crucial for waste management. It can enable contractors to pinpoint critical waste generation processes and to plan waste control strategies. In addition, waste estimation could also facilitate some government waste management policies, such as the waste disposal charging scheme in Hong Kong. Currently, tools that can accurately and conveniently estimate the amount of waste from construction, renovation, and demolition projects are lacking. In the light of this research gap, this paper presents a building information modeling (BIM) based system that we have developed for estimation and planning of D&R waste. BIM allows multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one digital building model. Our system can extract material and volume information through the BIM model and integrate the information for detailed waste estimation and planning. Waste recycling and reuse are also considered in our system. Extracted material information can be provided to recyclers before demolition or renovation to make recycling stage more cooperative and more efficient. Pick-up truck requirements and waste disposal charging fee for different waste facilities will also be predicted through our system. The results could provide alerts to contractors ahead of time at project planning stage. This paper also presents an example scenario with a 47-floor residential building in Hong Kong to demonstrate our D&R waste estimation and planning system. As the BIM technology has been increasingly adopted in the architectural, engineering and construction industry and digital building information models will likely to be available for most buildings (including historical buildings) in the future, our system can be used in various demolition and renovation projects and be extended to facilitate project control. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881229920

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is defined as a virtual 3D building model which integrates with a database of their building elements. Several studies recognize that the integration of BIM and LCA can simplify data acquisition of the building as well as provide both tools with feedback. This paper reviews recent studies centered on BIM-based LCA, and also carries out a methodological analysis of their integration, focusing on the way that BIM can contribute to simplifying data input, and optimize output data and results during the LCA application in buildings. The results show the viability to develop methods based on BIM models for organizing building information used to estimate environmental and energy consumption impacts based on LCA, including: templates and plug-ins for BIM software, and the integration of automated processes combining different data and software.

However, the study of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4% of the total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction stage accounted for 12.6% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately 2% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage. Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings. However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use phase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain. We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy. We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030479533

However, in reality, the supply chain is inseparable as precast components should be manufactured and transported to sites to fit in with the schedule of on-site assembly in seamless connection manner, and most risks are interrelated and associated with various stakeholders.

Despite the adoption of several waste management strategies, waste reduction to landfill continues seeming an insurmountable challenge. This paper explores factors impeding the effectiveness of existing waste management strategies, as well as strategies for reducing waste intensiveness of the construction industry. Drawing on series of semi structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading construction companies, this paper combines phenomenological approach with a critical review and analysis of extant literatures. Five broad categories of factors and practices are responsible for ineffectiveness of construction and demolition waste management strategies, which subsequently results in waste intensiveness of the industry. These include end of pipe treatment of waste, externality and incompatibility of waste management tools with design tools, atomism of waste management strategies, perceived or unexpected high cost of waste management, and culture of waste behaviour within the industry. To reduce waste intensiveness of the construction industry, the study suggests that six factors are requisites. These are tackling of waste at design stage, whole life waste consideration, compliance of waste management solutions with BIM, cheaper cost of waste management practice, increased stringency of waste management legislation and fiscal policies, and research and enlightenment. The proposed strategies are not only important for achieving low waste construction projects, they are important for reducing waste intensiveness of the construction. Implementation of the suggested measures would drive waste management practices within the construction industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938863440

These are some of the most progressive environmental targets for the built environment in the western world. However, there are also other sustainability issues that need to be addressed by the UK construction industry, particularly negative impacts from the generation of waste. Currently, 100 million tonnes of construction waste, including 13 million tonnes of unused materials, is generated each year, with only 20% currently capable of being recycled. The majority of this waste ends up in landfill, contributing to further pollution of the biosphere. The literature suggests that these negative impacts result from a variety of causes, including ineffective leadership, ingrained cultures, outdated technologies and poor logistics. There are a number of innovative projects within the UK, particularly at a local level, that pose the question as to whether bottom up approaches may be more successful than top down policies, as set by national and local government. This paper presents a case study demonstrating the former approach within the construction industry.

To support decision making in the early design stage, we propose an approach using Building Information Modeling (BIM) to assess a wide range of construction options and their embodied environmental impact. We use a conceptual BIM model to evaluate a variety of material compositions for different building elements and the potential contribution of elements to the total embodied impact of the building design.

Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life.

Waste intelligence advocates retrospective measures to manage waste after it is produced. Existing waste intelligence based waste management software are fundamentally limited and cannot facilitate stakeholders in controlling wasteful activities. Paradoxically, despite a great amount of effort, the waste being produced by the construction industry is escalating. This undesirable situation motivates a radical change from waste intelligence to waste analytics (in which waste is propose to be tackle proactively right at design through sophisticated big data technologies). This paper highlight that waste minimisation at design (a.k.a. designing-out waste) is data-driven and computationally intensive challenge. The aim of this paper is to propose a Big Data architecture for construction waste analytics. To this end, existing literature on big data technologies is reviewed to identify the critical components of the proposed Big Data based waste analytics architecture. At the crux, graph-based components are used: in particular, a graph database (Neo4J) is adopted to store highly voluminous and diverse datasets. To complement, Spark, a highly resilient graph processing system, is employed. Provision for extensions through Building Information Modelling (BIM) are also considered for synergy and greater adoption. This symbiotic integration of technologies enables a vibrant environment for design exploration and optimisation to tackle construction waste. The main contribution of this paper is that it presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first Big Data based architecture for construction waste analytics. The architecture is validated for exploratory analytics of 200,000 waste disposal records from 900 completed projects. It is revealed that existing waste management software classify the bulk of construction waste as mixed waste, which exposes poor waste data management.

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014878028

The LCA was carried out on a life case study of a 2100 m2 two-floor primary-school building, as well as a variability analysis, by varying the material specification in terms of whole building materials.

Data analyses include Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, mean testing using significance index, and exploratory factor analysis. The result of the factor analysis reveals that an underlying factor structure of five DfD factors groups that include ‘stringent legislation and policy’, ‘deconstruction design process and competencies’, ‘design for material recovery’, ‘design for material reuse’, and ‘design for building flexibility’. These groups of DfD factor groups show that the requirements for DfD goes beyond technical competencies and that non-technical factors such as stringent legislation and policy and design process and competency for deconstruction are key in designing deconstructable buildings. Paying attention to the factors identified in all of these categories will help to tackle impediments that could hinder the effectiveness of DfD.

Despite an adoption of several waste management strategies, and introduction of various legislative measures, reducing waste generated by the industry remains challenging. In order to understand cultural factors contributing to waste intensiveness of the industry, as well as those preventing effectiveness of existing waste management strategies, this study examines cultural profile of construction industry. Drawing on four focus group discussions with industry experts, the study employs phenomenological approach to explore waste inducing cultural factors. Combining findings from phenomenological research with extant literatures, the study suggests that in order to reduce waste intensiveness of the construction industry, five waste inducing cultural factors need to be changed. These include (i) ""make-do"" understanding that usually result in ""make-do waste"" (ii) non-collaborative culture, which results in reworks and other forms of wasteful activities (iii) blame culture, which encourages shifting of waste preventive responsibilities between designers and contractors, (iv) culture of waste behaviour, which encourages belief in waste inevitability, and (v) conservatism, which hinders diffusion of innovation across the industry. Changing these sets of cultural and behavioural activities is not only important for engendering waste management practices; they are requisite for effectiveness of existing strategies. Improvement in the identified areas is also required for overall improvement and general resource efficiency of the construction industry. Thus, this paper advocates cultural shift as a means of reducing waste landfilled by the construction industry, thereby enhancing sustainability and profitability of the industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the reports suggest the adoption of innovations including off-site manufacture and emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) to overcome the challenges facing the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of off-site manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of off-site manufacture, the benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture have been widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction. However, studies about impacts of BIM on off-site manufacture are scarce with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates the implications of BIM systems on off-site manufacture and traditional construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of BIM for off-site manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support off-site manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of off-site manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture and traditional construction is undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on off-site manufacture, off-site manufacture and BIM on traditional construction. The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on off-site manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient and one of the best ways to improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the construction industry for generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031763679

This is evidenced by the unrelenting release of national BIM initiatives; new BIM protocols; and candidate international standards. This paper is the second part of an ongoing Macro BIM Adoption study: the first paper “Macro BIM Adoption: Conceptual Structures” (Succar and Kassem, 2015) introduced five conceptual models for assessing macro BIM adoption across markets and informing the development of BIM adoption policies. This second paper clarifies how these models are validated through capturing the input of 99 experts from 21 countries using a survey tool; highlights the commonalities and differences between sample countries with respect to BIM adoption; and introduces sample tools and templates for either developing or calibrating BIM adoption policies. Survey data collected indicate that all five conceptual models demonstrate high levels of ‘clarity’, ‘accuracy’ and ‘usefulness’, the three metrics measured. They also indicate (1) varying rates of BIM diffusion across countries with BIM capability near the lower-end of the spectrum; (2) varying levels of BIM maturity with - the mean of - most macro BIM components falling below the medium level; (3) varying diffusion dynamics across countries with the prevalence of the middle-out diffusion dynamic; (4) varying policy actions across countries with a predominance of the passive policy approach; and (5) varying distribution of diffusion responsibilities among player groups with no detectable dominant pattern across countries. The two papers provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of BIM adoption dynamics across countries. Future research can build upon the models and tools introduced to enable (a) an expansion of benchmarking data through surveying additional countries; (b) identifying BIM adoption changes in surveyed countries over time; (c) correlating changes in adoption rates/patterns with policy interventions; (d) identifying BIM policy variations within the same country; (e) establishing statistical correlations between the conceptual models; and (f) developing new tools to facilitate BIM policy development and encouraging BIM adoption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018274103

BIM can be utilized as a less expensive, virtual, and computational environment to enable designers to ponder different design options, or contractors to evaluate different construction schemes, both with a view to minimizing construction waste generation. However, existing debate on this topic too frequently treats BIM as a cure-all silver bullet; without some major hurdles being adequately addressed, the applications of BIM will remain rhetorical. This paper aims to demystify BIM's computational application to CWM. Based on a critical literature review, a prototypical framework of a computational BIM for CWM is delineated, within which the two key prerequisites of ‘information readiness’ and ‘computational algorithms’ are highlighted. Then, the paper details the required information and how it can be organized in a standalone database or encapsulated in existing BIM for CWM. Learning from the historical development of data infrastructure in the field of BIM-based cost management, the process to develop the required information is likely to be tortuous but is unavoidable. The paper further explores computational BIM algorithms that can manipulate the information to facilitate decision-making for CWM. Finally, the operation of computational BIM is elaborated by relating it to various prevailing procurement models within which BIM applications are contextualized. Although the framework reported here has been substantially developed for experimental application, it is not to be taken as an immediately applicable solution but rather as an illustration of the kind of platform on which future development of computational BIM for CWM can proceed in a more efficient and effective fashion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993990049

A qualitative approach is used to revisit the design, construction, and demolition stages of prefabricated buildings; in so doing, the circular-economy framework is applied to foster circular prefabricated modi operandi. Prefabrication of buildings can be divided into four entities: elements and components, panels (or non-volumetric elements), volumetric, and entire modules. Through an analysis of published research on how the circular economy can be applied to different industry sectors and production processes, seven strategies emerged, each of which revealed the potential of improving the circular economy of buildings. The first strategy is reduction of waste through a lean production chain. By reusing the waste, the second strategy investigates the use of by-products in the production of new components. The third strategy focuses on the reuse of replacement parts and components. The fourth strategy is based on design toward adaptability, respectively focusing on reusability of components and adapting components for a second use with a different purpose. Similarly, the fifth strategy considers the implications of designing for disassembly with Building Information Modeling so as to improve the end-of-life deconstruction phase. The sixth strategy focuses on design with attention to recyclability of used material. Finally, the seventh strategy considers the use of tracking technologies with embedded information on components' geometric and mechanic characteristics as well as their location and life cycle to enable second use after deconstruction. It is demonstrated that prefabricated buildings are key to material savings, waste reduction, reuse of components, and various other forms of optimization for the construction sector. By adopting the identified strategies in prefabricated buildings, a circular economy could be implemented within the construction industry. Finally, seven guidelines were distilled from the review and linked to the identified strategies. Owing to their degree of adaptability and capacity of being disassembled, prefabricated buildings would allow waste reduction and facilitate a second life of components. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053866943

The aim of this paper is to describe a new efficient single-target selective disassembly sequence planning method developed for adaptive reuse of buildings. Finding a global optimum disassembly planning solution for buildings can be time consuming and physically impractical due to the high number of possible solutions. The method developed seeks to minimize environmental impact and removal costs using rule-based recursive analyses for planning recovery of target components from multi-instance building subsystems based upon physical, environmental and economic constraints. Rule-based recursive methods have been demonstrated to be an efficient alternative to find near-optimal disassembly sequences by eliminating uncommon or unrealistic solutions. Validation is achieved through functional demonstration with case studies, where high quality, practical, realistic, and physically feasible solutions for single-target selective disassembly of buildings are found by using the new method.

The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario.

Furthermore, greenhouse gases (GHG) are one of construction emissions that should be investigated to calculate the overall emissions. Therefore, estimating construction emissions is very important in order to keep emissions at an acceptable level. This paper presents a building information modeling (BIM)-based model that enables the estimation of six types of emissions including: greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, particular matter, eutrophication particles, ozone depleting particles and smog. As such, the total direct and indirect emissions can be calculated where these emissions are produced from construction activities during the overall project life cycle phases which are: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, operation phase, maintenance phase, and deconstruction/demolition phase. The methods of calculating direct and indirect emissions are extensively described in the paper.

These principles recognize the importance of the End-of-Life stage in existing buildings, including adaptive reuse as an attractive alternative in a circular economy.

Therefore, there are limitations in the existing literature for estimating DW with a consistent classification system. Building information modeling (BIM) is a technology that can generate and manage all the information required during the life cycle of a building, from design to demolition. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of research regarding its application to the demolition stage of a building. For an effective waste management plan, the estimation of the type and volume of DW should begin from the building design stage. However, the lack of tools hinders an early estimation. This study proposes a BIM-based framework that estimates DW in the early design stages, to achieve an effective and streamlined planning, processing, and management. Specifically, the input of construction materials in the Korean construction classification system and those in the BIM library were matched. Based on this matching integration, the estimates of DW by type were calculated by applying the weight/unit volume factors and the rates of DW volume change. To verify the framework, its operation was demonstrated by means of an actual BIM modeling and by comparing its results with those available in the literature.

This study therefore reviews waste interventions. Multiple case studies, spanning new builds and refurbishment, were undertaken to examine systemic mechanisms that lead to components being discarded. Evidence from fieldwork observations, waste documentation, and interviews indicates that the generators of unwanted components effectively decide their fate, and a failure to identify components in advance, uncertainty over usefulness, the perception of cost and programme risk in reclamation, and the preferential order of the waste hierarchy mean that the decision to discard to waste management goes unchallenged.

At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And, modifications and deviations of the original building structure, equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete, obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning. To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings, buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment. Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building information as it occurs in existing buildings. We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with software modules for building information acquisition, 3D reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally. For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements. From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction information is used for optimized project planning with a solution algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) at hand. In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities. Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification, onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options. Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and will further improve the systems’ quality, effectiveness and accuracy. Future research and application areas are seen in the quantification and analysis of the effects of missing data, the integration of material classification and sampling sensors into the system, the system connection to Building Information Modelling (BIM) software via a respective interface and the transfer and extension to retrofit project planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044162615

In addition, decisive roles required of designers in designing out waste remains inadequately addressed. As such, this study aims to map out attributes of waste effective design and design documents. Drawing on series of semi-structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading design and construction companies, this paper employs qualitative approach to explore design and design document qualities for waste efficient construction projects. The study suggests that for a design to assist in reducing construction and demolition waste, it needs to fulfil five key requisites, while its documentation is expected to fulfil four key requisites. A waste efficient design would incorporate standardization and dimensional coordination, employ principles in modern methods of construction, provides measures for spatial and components flexibility, make provisions for end of life deconstruction and employs techniques in BIM for design coordination. Waste efficient design documentation, on the other hand, is characterised by completeness and clarity, certainty and timeliness, freedom from error, and incorporation of set of plans and schedules that are waste militating. A validation of these findings in a case study of waste-to-energy project confirmed that the strategies are essential to preventing construction waste. Measures through which design and design documents could achieve the identified waste effective attributes are highlighted and discussed. Findings of this study could assist in understanding a set of measures that should be taken at project planning and design stages in order to mitigate waste intensiveness of the construction industry.

However, this technology currently is not sufficient to fulfil the needs of construction practitioners in terms of proactive design and planning for boarding of light-frame residential buildings. This is partially due to the fact that boarding design and planning requires trades’ know-how and substantial manual effort in developing the building information models. Current manual and ad hoc decision making for boarding of light-frame buildings leads to the generation of a significant amount of material waste. This research thus proposes a rule-based automated building information model (BIM) approach for designing boarding layout and planning material sheet cutting, resulting in practically feasible solutions with minimal material waste. In this research, object-based computer-processable layout design rules are comprehensively formalised based on trades’ know-how. On this basis, rule-based design algorithms are further developed and integrated with mathematical algorithms in order to automatically generate design and planning alternatives while minimising material waste. Rich information in the BIM is leveraged to automate the rule-based boarding design and planning. A prototype system is developed based on Autodesk Revit via Application Programming Interface. A typical wood-framed residential building is used as a case study to test the developed prototype system.

Circular economy would provide the strategic key for addressing this issue: construction industry may, in fact, become an elective consumer of its own waste, where construction materials are circular and eco-designed. A comprehensive case study has been built, starting from evaluation of different management options for this waste to be applied in the municipality of Bologna and prosecuting with the design of concrete mixes, implementing construction and demolition derived aggregates as partial replacement for natural aggregates. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been applied to evaluate the environmental impact of the options designed, in comparison with standard concrete already on the market. In particular, 25% replacement of natural aggregates leads to almost equal decrease in respiratory inorganics related impact and more than 39% decrease in land occupation indicator, even though ozone layer depletion impact indicator shows a negative performance. Nevertheless, partial aggregates replacement should be coupled by a limited cement replacement, in order to trigger a substantial decrease of the environmental impact in concrete production. © 2018 The Authors.

Their main focus has been on the design of new buildings. However, these movements have neglected the life span of existing buildings and the long-term management of building stocks. The reasons why are considered: the changing interpretations of sustainability, the evolution of different forms of tacit knowledge, lack of a metabolic framework covering the built environment and lack of a consistent multi-scale building information modelling (BIM). The transition toward a ‘risk society’, with an increasing diversity and frequency of threats, challenges the current optimistic definition of sustainability. Resilience addresses fast- and slow-moving threats that can lead to unknown consequences and new risks. Alternative planning approaches (e.g. scenario planning, adaptive change and resilience heuristics) are discussed. The differences between anticipation- and resilience-based strategies are considered. Possible heuristics can be found in social–ecological systems, in resilience engineering and in the historic evolution of the built environment. Resilient solutions generally lead to a higher level of complexity and carry additional environmental costs. In the creation of resilience capacity, new knowledge will be co-produced through transdisciplinary research, scenario planning and design experiments under conditions of uncertainty. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027839613

This paper is performed in three main steps. First, the current state of piping prefabrication, the attitude of MEP contractors to piping prefabrication, and the challenges of piping prefabrication are identiﬁed through a comprehensive data collection process that included semi-structured interviews, case studies, site visits, and questionnaires. The second step included suggesting a pattern and roadway of piping prefabrication. The results showed that: (1) The attitudes to feasibility of piping prefabrication differ in piping systems, piping connector modes, and types of project; and (2) building information modelling (BIM) promotes the adoption of piping prefabrication. Integrated project delivery (IPD), and distributor's early involvement into projects have signiﬁcant effects on the successful implementation of piping prefabrication. (3) The main barriers and challenges were identiﬁed including the low level of standardization of design, lack of preferential policy, economies of scale, low-skilled workers, as well as the availability of ﬁttings and valves. In the ﬁnal step, a four-phase route of piping prefabrication is suggested for MEP contractors to expand the prefabrication capacity incrementally. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) This paper proposes a route for MEP contractors to improve their piping construction through the Modular and offsite construction (MOC) method. (2) This paper ﬁnds that the level of feasibility of piping prefabrication differs in piping systems, connection modes, and types of project.

Through this, the sustainability level of China's construction industry is expected to be enhanced from the economic, social and environmental perspectives. So far, there has been limited understanding of how BIM, as a digital technology, would affect other contemporary sustainable construction practices from the industry professionals' point of view. Limited studies have been carried out to study the regional differences of these contemporary sustainable practices in China. This study adopted a questionnaire-based approach targeting industry professionals from three different metropolitan cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wenzhou).The follow-up comprehensive statistical analysis revealed that with regards to these contemporary sustainable construction practices, survey participants held much varied views on the growth of renovation projects, traditional Design-Bid-Build delivery, and conventional on-site construction methods. These three types were also generally perceived to have weak correlation with BIM application. Regional comparison further conveyed information on differences in perceptions among survey respondents from these three cities. For example, respondents from Wenzhou perceived more positive effects of BIM use in conventional construction projects. This research addressed the inter-correlation among these emerging sustainable construction practices, as well as the regional differences in China's construction market. The findings provide insights and the big picture for both governmental authorities and industry practitioners on the latest sustainable practices of China's construction industry. Recommendations are also offered towards improved economic, social and environmental sustainability performance for construction projects in the country. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055548365

Lean thinking is a relatively new process improvement philosophy which approaches inefficiency by reducing the waste. Although the inefficiency of design stages has been associated with the poor results of construction projects, less attention has been paid on the relationship between lean thinking and architectural design process. While there is a strong potential for improvement in the design processes via application of lean thinking, an analysis of waste items has never been done. Thus, this study aims to identify, categorize, and rank the waste items in architectural design sector. In the first stage of the study 28 design waste items were identified and classified under 8 lean production waste categories as a result of semistructured interviews conducted with senior architects performing in Ankara, Turkey. In the second stage, a questionnaire was executed over a larger population of architects to examine the ""frequency of occurrence"", ""impact over cost"", ""impact over duration"", and ""impact over quality"" for each design waste item. The findings were statistically analysed and an evaluation of risk was completed. The statistical analysis of the questionnaires shows that there is a shared understanding of impacts of waste items over architectural design processes, with strong statistical evidence over their validity. The results of the study can be utilized for the strategical implementation of lean production philosophy in architectural design process.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976384913

There are however still financing opportunities for building projects that are perceived as less risky. Buildings that are not only sustainable, but also flexible and adaptive, are becoming attractive alternatives for traditional buildings. Many innovative concepts are combined in a new form of contracting, called the Living Building Concept. In this concept, buildings are continuously adapted to changing user and/or client needs in the form of Product/Service combinations. In this paper we will zoom in on the implications for building information modelling and construction ICT. Object based, parametric design technologies become more important than ever before. The new business concepts require a life-cycle modeling approach in which individual components and materials play a central role. Buildings are considered as temporary configurations of these components and materials. The functional life of buildings, which strives for higher and sustainable end-user value, becomes detached from the technical life of building components and materials, offering new opportunities for reuse, remanufacturing and recycling. © 2009 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349116259

These tasks are onerous and error prone. Moreover, they do not allow effective detection of design issues and validation of project information quality for handover which lead to waste of resources when performing maintenance and repairs during operations. Building Information Modeling has the potential to help owners overcome these challenges by enabling seamless exchange of project information between design, construction, and operations while supporting and proving opportunities for automated design reviews. However, this practice has yet to fully take root in the industry due to its relative novelty. The research project presented in this paper set out to understand how owners could adopt and implement BIM to support design and information handover review. Two large public owner organizations were investigated over five years to support this aim. The findings are articulated around three levels of compliance for the owner’s project and BIM requirements. The findings on compliance review suggest three elements: model structure verification, model content verification and design compliance review. These three elements rely on model queries which are identified through investigation of owner’s operational requirements. The presented research connects modeling practice to support facilities maintenance, owner’s information requirements, and owner’s design requirements and leverages this information for model based compliance review. © 2018 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056596036

Mostly actual quantum of waste generation exceeds the percentage envisaged initially, causing needless utilization of both natural and human resources. It is understood from project and construction managers during site survey that there is plenty of scope for enhancing project productivity simply by minimizing waste out of construction and also saving the cost as well as extraction of natural resources. This paper attempts to identify the causes towards generation of waste of different types of building materials during various stages of construction in different power plant projects in India. Subsequent to identification, methods are proposed to mitigate the generation of construction wastes by adopting appropriate construction and management checks and methods, which allow waste reduction. The use of various building materials in different types of projects has different impact on the amount of waste generation, environment, and cost. Research data were gathered from the analysis of five power plant projects under construction or already completed in different states in India. The causes of such occurrences of each item and details have been analysed from the questionnaire survey and the same was processed for normalizing, data cleaning, and reliability analysis done through SPSS. The result of the first questionnaire was used along with site inputs/factual data to project the tabulation of perception versus reality. Furthermore, a second questionnaire was initiated for the validation of the above using non parametric statistic test and suitable recommendations were given to reduce wastage. The research paper reveals the major root causes for material wastage in construction of power plant projects and proper awareness to be created to the relevant project team by training. The findings of this paper would help in enhancing project productivity during construction, cost savings to the extent of 1.667% to 1.941% of total project cost and minimizing the extraction of natural resources. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043449286
