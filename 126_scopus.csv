They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

During this transformation, a multi-disciplinary knowledge base, created from studies and research about the built environment aspects is fundamental: historical, architectural, archeologically, environmental, social, economic, etc., and critical. Although there are a growing number of applications of 3D VR modelling applications, some built environment applications such as disaster management, environmental simulations, computer-aided architectural design and planning require more sophisticated models beyond 3D graphical visualization such as multifunctional, interoperable, intelligent, and multi-representational. Advanced digital mapping technologies such as 3D laser scanner technologies can be enablers for effective e-planning, consultation and communication of users' views during the planning, design, construction and lifecycle process of the built environment. These technologies can be used to drive the productivity gains by promoting a free-flow of information between departments, divisions, offices, and sites; and between themselves, their contractors and partners when the data captured via those technologies are processed and modelled into building information modelling (BIM). The use of these technologies is a key enabler to the creation of new approaches to the ""Whole Life Cycle"" process within the built and human environment for the twenty-first century. This paper aims to look at this subject. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the research towards BIM for existing structures via the point cloud data captured by the 3D laser scanner technology. A case study building is used to demonstrate how to produce 3D CAD models and BIM models of existing structures based on designated techniques. Findings - The paper finds that BIM can be achieved for existing structures by modelling the data captured with 3D laser scanner from the existing world. This can be accomplished by adapting appropriate automated data processing and pattern recognition techniques through applied science research. Practical implications - BMI will enable automated and fast data capture and modelling for not only in design and planning, building refurbishment, effective heritage documentation and VR modelling but also disaster management, environmental analysis, assessment and monitoring, GIS implementation, sophisticated simulation environments for different purposes such as climate change, regeneration simulation for complexity and uncertainty and so on. As a result, it will increase the capability for fast production of virtual reality models and comprehensive and sophisticated simulation platforms. Originality/value - The paper provides useful information on BMI for existing structures.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949107149

Current BIM software is almost completely focused on new buildings and has very limited tools and pre-defined libraries for modelling existing and historic buildings. The development of reusable parametric library objects for existing and historic buildings supports modelling with high levels of detail while decreasing the modelling time. Mapping these parametric objects to survey data, however, is still a time-consuming task that requires further research. Promising developments have been made towards automatic object recognition and feature extraction from point clouds for as-built BIM. However, results are currently limited to simple and planar features. Further work is required for automatic accurate and reliable reconstruction of complex geometries from point cloud data. Procedural modelling can provide an automated solution for generating 3D geometries but lacks the detail and accuracy required for most as-built applications in AEC and heritage fields. © Authors 2017.

The recent developed Building Information Modelling (BIM) technique combines 3D modelling and information management. One of its modern application is heritage documentation and has generated a new concept of Historic/Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM). This paper summarises the applications of these information techniques on the built heritage documentation. We utilise Web of Science Collection to monitor the publications on built heritage documentation. We analyse the research trend in heritage modelling by comparing the attention paid by researchers before and during the 2010s. The results show that photogrammetry is always the most popular method in heritage modelling. More and more works in heritage modelling have begun to use laser scanning, computer science, GIS and especially BIM techniques. Ontologies and 3D computer graphics are traditional ways for heritage documentation. Moreover, we pay attention to the roles of BIM on heritage documentation and conduct a detailed discussion on how to extend the HBIM capabilities by integrating with other techniques. The integration provides possible enhanced functions in HBIM, including accurate parametric modelling from computer graphics, automatic semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud from reality-based modelling, spatial information management and analysis by GIS, and knowledge modelling by ontology. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087929392

The ""DNA"" of Preventive Conservation. Various authors so far support the argument that preventive conservation is an effective way to respond to the challenges society faces with the preservation of its Cultural Heritage (Van Balen, 2013). A few decades of experiences with the application of preventive conservation in the field of immovable heritage in the form of Monumentenwacht in The Netherland and in Flanders have shown that a good monitoring of the state of preservation with a strong push for maintenance activities contributes to more preservation of authenticity, to more cost-effective preservation and to empowering society in dealing with heritage preservation. (Cebron, 2008) An analysis of these and similar experiences demonstrates that these ""Monumentenwacht"" activities represent only a part of what could be named a preventive conservation system. Other fields in which prevention is advocated for its higher efficiency, show the importance of system thinking in the development of improved strategies. Applying this approach to the field of the immovable heritage, referring to the initial results shown by the Monumentenwacht practices, it becomes clear that different dimension are at stake simultaneously: The preservation of authenticity or integrity, the management of resources and the connection with society. It shows that the analysis of challenges in heritage preservation and the development of strategies is à priori multifaceted and therefor has a certain level of complexity. The sustainability of the preservation of cultural heritage buildings and sites can be measured according to its multiple economic, social, environmental and cultural support. The Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe report shows that the more diverse the support is for cultural heritage preservation actions, the more those actions will contribute to sustainable development and the more sustainable the preservation of that heritage will be. This reasoning has led to the ""upstream approach"" which argues that cultural heritage preservation can benefit from a variety of resources which do not necessarily have to be earmarked for it à priori (CHCfE, 2015). It leads to arguing for an holistic and integrated approach for cultural heritage preservation that taps into different kinds of resources, which requires acknowledgement of the complex nature of understanding and managing heritage values into an overall societal development goal (Vandesande, 2017). © Authors 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030227912

We develop a set of discriminative features for the task, namely visual brightness, infrared opaqueness, and an occlusion indicator, within a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework to provide structured prediction for window or glass regions. A preprocessing classifier is trained on the features to produce node potentials, and large margin parameter training is used to boost performance. Our algorithm has been trained on data taken at the 3rd floor of Cory Hall at UC Berkeley, with a total façade area of 269.1 m2, and has been tested on walls taken on the 2 nd floor of Cory Hall, a Walgreens, and an office building in San Francisco, with a total exterior façade area of 454.6 m2.

Abundant researches have gradually proven that Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) is a relevant alternative for the collaborative management of information related to existing structures. Apart from the obvious benefits of HBIM for information exchange among stakeholders during conservation project, the potential of such processes to support preservation strategies should not be neglected. Moreover, the recent developments of HBIM web-interfaces illustrate the need for additional investigation in strengthening the relationships between the digital model and the real-world to better support preventive conservation of heritage places. Besides, values-based approaches for the elaboration of conservation strategies have been gradually adopted in the last decades, both in academic and professional sector. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology to structure and integrate the cultural significance of tangible and intangible elements into HBIM models to be further taken into account in the analysis and simulation of data. This article suggests the application of Digital Twin (DT) principles to support site managers in the preventive conservation of their assets. Based on the analysis and simulations of data captured by onsite sensors, threats to the site integrity and corresponding preventive solution can be predicted in the DT environment. The integration and structuration of Heritage Values in HBIM models allow further evaluation process to estimate the impact of each suggested interventions on the conservation of features of significance. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

As-built BIM refers to a BIM representation of the “as-is” conditions of built heritage at the time of a survey. Determining the level of development (LoD) is crucial for as-built BIM owing to its relevance to model effects and modeling efforts. This study addresses this issue from the viewpoint of a brick structure based on a case study of a fifteenth-century ruin in Nanjing, China. Three LoDs are proposed based on the combined use of a commercial platform and auxiliary tools: A host model linked with raster images composed using orthoimage and relief maps (LoD 1), an as-built volume with semantic skins (LoD 2), and a brick-by-brick model with custom industry foundation class parameters at local areas (LoD 3). The results reveal that LoD 1 caters to an efficient web-based workflow for brick-damage annotations; as-built dimensions can be extracted from LoD 2; and LoD 3 enables attributes, such as damage types, to be attached at the brick level. In future studies, the detection of brick shapes is expected to automate the process of as-built surface mapping. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076685703
