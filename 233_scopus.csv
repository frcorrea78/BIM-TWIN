In this way, the specification for an intelligent product is being built - one whose information content is permanently bound to its material content. This paper explores the impact of such development on supply chains, contrasting between simple and complex product supply chains. The Auto-ID project is on track to enable such connectivity between products and information using a single, open-standard, data repository for storage and retrieval of product information. The potential impact on the design and management of supply chains is immense. This paper provides an introduction to of some of these changes, demonstrating that by enabling intelligent products, Auto ID systems will be instrumental in driving future supply chains. The paper also identifies specific application areas for this technology in the product supply chain.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036970034

The approach seeks to give a customer greater control over the processing of an order - by integrating technologies which allow for greater tracking of the order and methodologies which allow the customer [via the order] to dynamically influence the way the order is produced, stored or transported. The paper examines developments from four distinct perspectives: conceptual developments, theoretical issues, practical deployment and business opportunities. In each area, existing work is reviewed and open challenges for research are identified. The paper concludes by identifying four key obstacles to be overcome in order to successfully deploy product intelligence in an industrial application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the PI approach, the goods are encapsulated in modularly dimensioned, reusable or recyclable, and smart containers, called PI-containers. This paper focuses on the informational context of such containers and more particularly on their associated activeness. This capability allows the PI-container to have an active role in achieving its mission and in the PI management and operation. After a presentation of the physical and informational aspects associated to PI-containers in hyperconnected logistics, a state-of-the-art review of the field of smart containers is provided. The limitations of actual solutions for fulfilling the informational requirements are highlighted. The notion of activeness is detailed and a descriptive framework is introduced. Finally, a grouping application of containers in a PI-hub is used to illustrate the proposed framework. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955512392

Auto-ID technologies such as RFID are a good example of that. The actual limits of these new systems are relative to their granularity, since items are the smallest parts of an ubiquitous system (Internet of things).

The idea of using intelligent products to ensure an information continuum all along the product life cycle is more and more shared today. However, it is not that easy to identify the information that must be linked to the product. As a result, this paper proposes an information dissemination process for selecting information sensitive to the context of use of the product. This information is then stored on the products themselves using a new type of augmented material, referred to as ""communicating material"". © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906946506

These communication nodes are attached to a thing or directly included in the material of the thing to form a communicating material. In communicating material, one of the desired objectives is to merge the logical data with its physical material, thus simplifying the monitoring of its life cycle, the maintenance operations, and the recycling process. In this context, the initial form of the communicating material can evolve during its lifecycle. It can be split, aggregated with other materials, or partially damaged. However, the entire information in the material should always be accessible after each change. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop specific algorithms for efficient dissemination of information in the material in order to limit information losses. Two dissemination algorithms hop-counter-based and probabilistic-based are proposed for storing data by using WSNs, and non-localized and localized storage is considered. Non-localized storage ensures that information can be retrieved from each piece of the material by using a uniform data replication process. Localized storage ensures that the information is stored in a limited region of the material. Castalia/OMNeT++ simulator is used to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with other similar protocols such as DEEP, Supple, and RaWMS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
