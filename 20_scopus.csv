This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449122114

Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers. A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context of the task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer. Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers' data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers' experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework. Copyright © 1996 M.E.

This requires the acquisition of data from various sources followed by the transformation of these data into an appropriate format. The integration and representation of heterogeneous data in a GIS are very important for use cases involving both BIM and GIS data, such as in the management of municipal facilities. We propose a BIM/GIS-based information Extract, Transform, and Load (BG-ETL) architecture that separates geometrical information from that related to the relevant properties. The property required for each use-case perspective is extracted and transformed from information for the BIM with FM to GIS using the ETL concept. In consideration of the viewpoint of geometry, the surface model for several representations in the GIS, we designed BG-ETL, developed a prototype, and verified the results through interviews. The results show that BG-ETL considering BIM/GIS integration issue has benefits such as reusability and extensibility. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. Elsevier B.V.

To make effective use of UGC, it is necessary to understand information quality (IQ) in this setting. Traditional IQ research focuses on corporate data and views users as data consumers. However, as users with varying levels of expertise contribute information in an open setting, current conceptualizations of IQ break down. In particular, the practice of modeling information requirements in terms of fixed classes, such as an Entity-Relationship diagram or relational database tables, unnecessarily restricts the IQ of user-generated data sets. This paper defines crowd information quality (crowd IQ), empirically examines implications of class-based modeling approaches for crowd IQ, and offers a path for improving crowd IQ using instance-and-attribute based modeling. To evaluate the impact of modeling decisions on IQ, we conducted three experiments. Results demonstrate that information accuracy depends on the classes used to model domains, with participants providing more accurate information when classifying phenomena at a more general level. In addition, we found greater overall accuracy when participants could provide freeform data compared to a condition in which they selected from constrained choices. We further demonstrate that, relative to attribute-based data collection, information loss occurs when class-based models are used.

These accumulated data have the potential to provide deep information that can help improve facility management. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

However, the implementation of BIM in building Operations & Maintenance (O&M) is still limited. Previous research only focused on identifying influential factors for the promotion of BIM use in building O&M without considering the systematic manner and the dynamic nature of technology evolution process. This study thus aims to establish an analytical activity system model (ASM) using the activity theory to analyze the BIM use in building O&M in a systematic and dynamic way. The ASMs (traditional and evolutionary) of two different statuses (i.e., without and with BIM-assisted O&M) and the corresponding evolution processes were established based on the critical process models with actors and activities identified in the 1st round interviews with 14 experts. Then, the contradictions as the drivers of evolution in the ASM from the traditional one to the evolutionary BIM-assisted O&M have been examined based on the 2nd round interviews involving the 14 experts and 32 questionnaire surveys. An ASM based driver model of evolution for the BIM-assisted O&M is finally constructed. 26 innovation-oriented internal drivers and six demand-oriented external drivers have been identified, and 21 recommended actions, with the context of social, political and technical influences, have been proposed correspondingly to enhance the identified drivers to achieve BIM-assisted O&M. These results provide a map for O&M practitioners, policy makers and researchers to promote the implementation of BIM in O&M, and are beneficial to the delivery of BIM in building O&M. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032807536

The main dilemma of maintenance scheduling is to avoid failures while preventing unnecessary maintenance. The technological advancements in real time monitoring and computational science make tracking asset health and forecasting asset failures possible. The usage and maintenance of assets can be planned more efficiently with the forecasted failure probability and remaining useful life (i.e., prognostic information). The prognostic information is time sensitive. Geographically distributed assets such as off-shore wind farms and railway switches add another complexity to the maintenance scheduling problem with the required time of travel to reach these assets. Thus, the travel time between geographically distributed assets should be incorporated in the maintenance scheduling when one technician (or team) is responsible for the maintenance of multiple assets. This paper presents a methodology to schedule the maintenance of geographically distributed assets using their prognostic information. Genetic Algorithm based solution incorporating the daily work duration of the maintenance team is also presented in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Managing the work of FM effectively is extremely difficult owing to the variety of environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of two-dimensional (2D) graphics when depicting facilities. Building information modeling (BIM) uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the facilities depicted in three-dimensional (3D) object-oriented computer-aided design (CAD). This paper proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FM that uses an integrated 2D barcode and the BIM approach. Using 2D barcode and BIM technologies, this study proposes a mobile automated BIM-based facility management (BIMFM) system for FM staff in the operation and maintenance phase. The mobile automated BIMFM system is then applied in a selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FM practice. The combined results demonstrate that a BIMFM-like system can be an effective mobile automated FM tool. The advantage of the mobile automated BIMFM system lies not only in improving FM work efficiency for the FM staff but also in facilitating FM updates and transfers in the BIM environment. © 2014 Yu-Cheng Lin et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933055939

As a prerequisite for meeting strategic business requirements, such as compliance with regulations, business integration, or integrated customer management, MDM comprises numerous activities. One of the central activities is designing and maintaining the master data architecture. Interestingly, though, the scientific community has remained almost silent with regard to the question as to how companies should proceed when designing the master data architecture. In order to shed light on this unexplored topic, the paper at hand presents the findings of a case study at Bosch Group. The case study shows that designing the master data architecture is a multidimensional task which requires balancing the interests of various organizational stakeholders, managing an array of technical opportunities, and meeting requirements of numerous master data classes. Also, the case study suggests that taking advantage of architectural design patterns may be an appropriate way to adequately address the complexity of the task. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Another reason is the growing importance of information systems supporting decision-making, requiring master data that is up-to-date, accurate and complete. While improving and maintaining master data quality is an organizational task that cannot be encountered by simply implementing a suitable software system, system support is mandatory in order to be able to meet challenges efficiently and make for good results. This paper describes the design process toward a functional reference model for master data quality management (MDQM). The model design process spanned several iterations comprising multiple design and evaluation cycles, including the model's application in a participative case study at consumer goods manufacturer Beiersdorf. Practitioners may use the reference model as an instrument for the analysis, design and implementation of a company's MDQM system landscape. Moreover, the reference model facilitates evaluation of software systems and supports company-internal and external communication. From a scientific perspective, the reference model is a design artifact; hence it represents a theory for designing information systems in the area of MDQM. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864411090

To overcome the drawbacks of conventional urban facilities management, this paper proposes an integrated approach to intelligent urban facilities management for real-time emergency response based on the integration of facilities-related information and the integration of management functions. For the verification of the proposed approach, a prototype of the Intelligent Urban Facilities Management System (IUFMS) has been developed and tested. Through information integration and functional integration, IUFMS is expected to detect any abnormalities in advance and take proper measures by performing a comprehensive analysis of urban facilities and their correlations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

BIM is both a process and a technology, offers wide solutions for facilities management. In order to monitor and manage facilities data in a BIM based simulated environment, this work reports upon a development of a system that uses BIM software and a wireless sensor technology to develop a proactive safety management system. However, to link BIM data with data values of wireless sensors motes will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and massive sensor data will contribute to the emerging model of big data.

The main objectives were to specify the access of data in Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) system, and to elaborate a methodology to gathering building O&amp;M costs data with the core outcome that is usable for further quantitative analysis included hypothesis testing. To achieve this objective, based on a questionnaire survey new sample of data collected on facility management factors, sites (n=76) and buildings on the sites (n=207) from the range of Hungarian Corporate Real Estates were participated. Data mining techniques included Descriptive Statistics, Correlation Analysis, one-way ANOVA and Box Plot was used to identify significant relationships to determine differences in annual O&amp;M costs by age, number of users and heritage.
