There are many views how to observe benefits of BIM in construction industry. It is clear that project management and optimization of management processes in construction projects is big challenge nowadays. The purpose of paper is to enhance efficiency of construction management practices. Paper follows up previous papers of authors that were focused on crucial points of construction management from view of structure and hierarchy of construction projects. There were defined crucial points in exchanging information and their insufficiency for concrete participant of construction project. This paper is focused on standardized environment for exchanging information in BIM. Generally, it is called Common Data Environment (further CDE). The paper observes influence of CDE on efficiency of construction projects and options of implementation into real projects. From practical experience of authors in project management in construction business were proposed possibilities of implementation to road projects in Czech Republic from view of feasibility. For several possible types of implementation of CDE (proposed by authors) were evaluated impacts on feasibility of construction projects primarily cost and benefits of implementation. From this evaluation were find out the most appropriate types of implementation for CDE and practical proposal of strategies of implementation of CDE into construction projects of multiple types of construction projects. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062445962

Requirements are very important in whole lifecycle of project. The one of the first activities in the project is a definition of a scope of the project. Usually the limited resources do not allow implement all set of requirements defined by customer. Project is almost always a compromise. But if project should be a good compromise, we have to select important requirements for implementation. Prioritization is very activity important for division of requirements by their importance. This paper brings simple method for scope definition based on this prioritization of requirements. The result of this method is scope defined in the way that prefers important requirements with respect to maximal use of available resources. Method also contains check aspects.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029751844

Organization of work on creation and using building information model during its whole life cycle is a key to get desirable effects of BIM approach. Specification of data that should be included in the model on which level of detail, responsibility for data acquisition and specification of data users is important part of building information modeling process. For the effective work with BIM models process models for various stages of information modeling are needed. Process models showing activities and data exchanges during Building Information Modeling are often part of BIM Execution Plan (BEP) and Information Delivery Manual (IDM). Used modeling languages are usually based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard but not making full use of its potential.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986898471

According to the spreading of a new trend in Building Design, Construction and Facility Management - using of Building Information Modelling Technology and its Management, there are going to be many changes in the way to develop the design process and other phases of building life cycle. BIM Technology use is present in the whole life cycle of buildings and other constructions and is able to connect all participants of building process in effective way. BIM Technology as a new trend in building design reveals the need to set up effective processes, their parts, participants, their responsibilities, goals and the way to reach goals, etc. The main philosophy of BIM Technology's implementation into the design processes lies in the BIM Execution Plan. This Plan should be specified for specific activities in specific environment and for specific participants in the whole construction process. These processes should be well conceived and managed. That's way we can undoubtedly replace the ""M"" in BIM (Modelling) by the ""M"" as a Management. This paper contributes to the further thoughtful strategy for the specific process of the design - from the designer's point of view and implementation of BIM Technology into this process in order to make the design process more effective. There are identified possible barriers for this implementation, their main causes, proposal to remove these obstacles and outlined a possible process of effective design using BIM technology and its principles. It is important to realize, that the implementation of BIM Technology in the design process will lead to a better virtual reality of the building and thus its transformation into physical reality will lead to a better construction and allow for greater cost savings not only during construction phase, but also in other phases of the building life cycle, especially during its use. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062451822

Inappropriate management can lead to increasing project costs, project delays, reducing productivity or loss of profit. The main goal of this paper is analysis of information insufficiency problems in construction projects. Paper gives overview of contemporary methods of management of construction projects from view of general contractor and describes current state of management in construction industry. Furthermore paper analyses general organization of construction company and describes dataflow and relationships among stakeholders of construction projects. Then problems during construction projects are investigated from external and internal view and their impacts and causes. When problems caused by insufficient information are identified, types of solutions are proposed together with methods of solution. Appropriate methods seem to be modern process modelling and building information modelling. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

The main topic of the article is the evaluation of 3D building scanning processes, photogrammetric surveying and subsequent processing of acquired data. From the acquired point clouds eventually produce project documentation of the current status of the building with minimal deviation from the actual building. This process demonstrates the possibilities of creating the current building documentation that is necessary for repairs and renovations within the building's life cycle. The difference in the measurement deviation between classical methods and the 3D scanning method, as well as the time required for measuring/scanning and the subsequent processing of the obtained data, is essential. Such data can serve as a useful basis for further work with data using BIM technology. This entire process, including all the steps, is demonstrated on a particular building. © SGEM2019.
