The insufficiencies caused by existing navigation approaches can be overcome by making use of the advanced semantic and geometric information included in intelligent building models. A key example of such models is Building Information Models (BIMs) which contain detailed geometric and semantic information about buildings. In fact, the BIMs' structure is very complex for facilitating navigation. This paper presents a new BIM Oriented Modeling methodology resulting in the definition of a new BIM based model (BO-IDM) dedicated for facilitating indoor navigation. The paper later describes the transformation of information from a standard BIM (IFC) into the new model (BO-IDM). The innovation aspects of BO-IDM can be summarized as follows: (i) it provides highly detailed semantic information for indoor navigation and (ii) it represents the non-geo-referenced structure and complex geometries of BIMs with ISO 19107 compliant representations. Therefore this model is well suited for indoor navigation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879452618

Typically, a grid is superimposed over a region, and a graph search is used to find the optimal (minimal cost) path. The most common scenario is to use a grid of tiles and to search using A*. This paper discusses the tradeoffs for different grid representations and grid search algorithms. Grid representations discussed are 4-way tiles, 8-way tiles, and hexes. This paper introduces texes as an efficient representation of hexes. The search algorithms used are A* and iterative deepening A* (IDA*). Application-dependent properties dictate which grid representation and search algorithm will yield the best results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974674579

Since 2001 ten terror attacks have been thwarted only in Great Britain. For that reason the aim of the presented research project is to develop a solution for response and recovery to support rescuers in finding the shortest way within a public building and provide them with important information in their particular spatial context. Existing building information models (BIM) are used for displaying plans on mobile devices and for routing purposes. The indoor navigation system is based on wireless LAN (WLAN), ultra-wide-band (UWB), and radio frequency identification (RFID). These technologies are described in detail and an overview on data formats which are used to retrieve building data out of the BIM for generating routing networks is given. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649089794

Contemporary applications require a path planner that is fast (to ensure real-time interaction with the environment) and flexible (to avoid local hazards such as small and dynamic obstacles). In addition, paths need to be smooth and short to ensure natural looking motions. Current path planning techniques do not obey these criteria simultaneously. For example, A* approaches generate unnatural looking paths, potential field-based methods are too slow, and sampling-based path planning techniques are inflexible. We propose a new technique, the Corridor Map Method (CMM), which satisfies all the criteria. In an off-line construction phase, the CMM creates a system of collision-free corridors for the static obstacles in an environment. In the query phase, paths can be planned inside the corridors for different types of characters while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Experiments show that high-quality paths for single characters or groups of characters can be obtained in real-time.

Now, a controller design can be developed, parameterized, tested and verified using so called Virtual Testbeds until they perform adequately in simulation. Then a stripped down version of the same simulation system uses the same simulation model and the same simulation algorithms on the real hardware implementing a real-time capable controller. This results in an integrated development approach, which brings simulation technology on the real hardware to bridge the gap between simulation and real world operation. In this way, Virtual Testbeds and control by 3D simulation provide major building blocks in the emerging field of eRobotics to keep manageable the ever increasing complexity of current computer-aided solutions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892851787

Traditional topology construction approaches for indoor space always based on 2D maps or pure geometry model, which remained information insufficient problem. Especially, an intelligent navigation for different applications depends mainly on the precise geometry and semantics of the navigation network. The trouble caused by existed topology construction approaches can be smoothed by employing IFC building model which contains detailed semantic and geometric information. In this paper, we present a method which combined a straight media axis transformation algorithm (S-MAT) with IFC building model to reconstruct indoor geometric topology network. This derived topology aimed at facilitating the decision making for different in-building navigation. In this work, we describe a multi-step deviation process including semantic cleaning, walkable features extraction, Multi-Storey 2D Mapping and S-MAT implementation to automatically generate topography information from existing indoor building model data given in IFC. © 2015, Copernicus.

We present a seamless workflow from industrial BIM generation to sampling-based planning of collision-free paths for mobile robots on 3D floor plans extracted from BIMs. Beyond robot motion planning, we apply the workflow to generate huge amounts of paths for floor plan analysis. We assume the paths to resemble walking patterns where many paths crossing a given floor tile match with heavy usage of this space. The resulting paths are sampled in heatmaps, where pixels then correspond to floor tiles and the color value corresponds to the number of crossing paths, yielding a semi-automatic, easy-to-use method to analyze floor plan layouts in different scenarios.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994357230
