These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes a hot topic. However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the features extracted by experts. The feature extraction process is an exhausted work and greatly impacts the final result. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the features of raw data automatically. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective DL method. In this study, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features. The proposed method which is tested on three famous datasets, including motor bearing dataset, self-priming centrifugal pump dataset, and axial piston hydraulic pump dataset, has achieved prediction accuracy of 99.79%, 99.481%, and 100%, respectively. The results have been compared with other DL and traditional methods, including adaptive deep CNN, sparse filter, deep belief network, and support vector machine.

This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios.

Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular ""Louvain algorithm"". The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature. © 2013 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888352905

Human's understanding may be an explicit input-output model representing the relationship among the system's variables. It may also be represented as knowledge implicitly (e.g., the connection weights of a neural network). Therefore, FDD is done through some kind of modeling, signal processing, and intelligence computation. In this paper, a variety of FDD techniques are reviewed within the unified data-processing framework to give a full picture of FDD and achieve a new level of understanding. According to the types of data and how the data are processed, the FDD methods are classified into three categories: model-based online data-driven methods, signal-based methods, and knowledge-based history data-driven methods.

In spite of availability of different efficient algorithms for fault detection, the wavelet analysis for feature extraction and Naïve Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for classification is taken and compared. This paper presents the use of Naïve Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for fault diagnosis through discrete wavelet features extracted from vibration signals of good and faulty conditions of the components of centrifugal pump. The classification accuracies of different discrete wavelet families were calculated and compared to find the best wavelet for the fault diagnosis of the centrifugal pump. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861900936

Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

In practice, due to harsh working environment and heavy working loads, multiple faults of an aircraft hydraulic pump may occur simultaneously after long time operations. However, most existing diagnosis methods can only distinguish pump faults that occur individually. Therefore, new method needs to be developed to realize effective diagnosis of simultaneous multiple faults on aircraft hydraulic pump. In this paper, a new method based on the layered clustering algorithm is proposed to diagnose multiple faults of an aircraft hydraulic pump that occur simultaneously. The intensive failure mechanism analyses of the five main types of faults are carried out, and based on these analyses the optimal combination and layout of diagnostic sensors is attained. The three layered diagnosis reasoning engine is designed according to the faults' risk priority number and the characteristics of different fault feature extraction methods. The most serious failures are first distinguished with the individual signal processing. To the desultory faults, i.e., swash plate eccentricity and incremental clearance increases between piston and slipper, the clustering diagnosis algorithm based on the statistical average relative power difference (ARPD) is proposed. By effectively enhancing the fault features of these two faults, the ARPDs calculated from vibration signals are employed to complete the hypothesis testing. The ARPDs of the different faults follow different probability distributions. Compared with the classical fast Fourier transform-based spectrum diagnosis method, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can diagnose the multiple faults, which occur synchronously, with higher precision and reliability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875250990

In recent years, keyword cooccurrence networks (KCNs) are exploited for knowledge mapping. In a KCN, each keyword is represented as a node and each co-occurrence of a pair of words is represented as a link. The number of times that a pair of words co-occurs in multiple articles constitutes the weight of the link connecting the pair. The network constructed in this manner represents cumulative knowledge of a domain and helps to uncover meaningful knowledge components and insights based on the patterns and strength of links between keywords that appear in the literature. In this work, we propose a KCN-based approach that can be implemented prior to undertaking a systematic review to guide and accelerate the review process. The novelty of this method lies in the new metrics used for statistical analysis of a KCN that differ from those typically used for KCN analysis. The approach is demonstrated through its application to nano-related Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) risk literature. The KCN approach identified the knowledge components, knowledge structure, and research trends that match with those discovered through a traditional systematic review of the nanoEHS field. Because KCN-based analyses can be conducted more quickly to explore a vast amount of literature, this method can provide a knowledge map and insights prior to undertaking a rigorous traditional systematic review. This two-step approach can significantly reduce the effort and time required for a traditional systematic literature review. The proposed KCN-based pre-systematic review method is universal. It can be applied to any scientific field of study to prepare a knowledge map. © 2017 Radhakrishnan et al.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for maintenance planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078707972

The proposed scheme fuses data from multiple sensors into a single system level performance metric using Mahalanobis Distance (MD), and generates fault clusters based on MD values. MD thresholds derived from the clustering analysis are used for fault detection and isolation. When a fault is detected, the prognostics scheme, which monitors the progression of the MD values over time, is initiated. Then, using a linear approximation, time to failure is estimated. The performance of the scheme has been validated via experiments performed on a mono-block centrifugal water pump testbed.

To date, BIM remains a relatively underutilized tool in horizontal construction. BIM has the potential, however, to significantly increase efficiencies, minimize waste, and increase sustainability across infrastructure projects throughout their life cycles. This research studies the impacts of the first implementation of BIM processes on one of two structurally similar concurrent bridge construction projects by comparing metrics related to substructure costs, requests for information, change orders, rework, and schedule. Findings suggest that negative cost impacts of approximately 70% may be associated with the first implementation of BIM during construction. However, additional findings suggest that the use of BIM may facilitate otherwise infeasible complex projects and reduce requests for information and change orders and has the potential to realize cost savings during follow-on projects. Specifically, findings from this case study suggest that BIM may have provided approximately 5-9% cost savings during construction by contributing to reduced change orders and rework. Revealing such impacts and benefits associated with using BIM on transportation infrastructure construction begins to inform the industry and, in particular, organizations such as DOTs and urban transportation districts about potential opportunities related to BIM implementation. Additional and potentially significantly greater benefits may be realized through future BIM-enabled operation and maintenance of such infrastructure.

Studies show that BIM is mainly used in the lifecycle stages of initiation, development and realisation.

Findings – This paper provides empirical insights into the sources of inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the activities of Dutch semi-public and public clients. It finds that the current added value of BIM in the operations stage is marginal. The main reasons for this are a lack of alignment between the supply of and demand for information and the context-dependent role of information.

For instance, both “Digital Twin” and “maintenance” concepts and strategies are described in detail, and then a literature review is carried out where these two concepts are involved. In addition to identifying and analyzing how DTs are currently being applied for maintenance, this paper also highlights future research lines and open issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092055078

The characterization and recognition of these faults are investigated in this paper to improve the efficiency and reliability of pumps. A time-frequency signal analysis method based on the cyclostationary theory is adopted to extract the frequency characteristic components from non-stationary vibration signals under cavitation and seal damage conditions. Specifically, the signal analysis was conducted preliminarily based on the calculation of cyclic autocorrelation functions (CAFs) for various signals. Corresponding slices are extracted from the CAFs and processed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. Consequently from the FFT spectra, indicators for characterization are extracted to demonstrate the occurrence and severity of faults. Results show that the indicators for seal damage characterization are 100 and 600-Hz frequency components in slice $\alpha =600$ Hz of CAF corresponding to shaft and blade passing frequency in the frequency domain of vibration signals. Meanwhile, the occurrence and development status of cavitation are indicated by the frequency component of 200 Hz in slice $\alpha =600$ Hz of CAF. Additionally, the effect of instability caused by off-design, seal damage, and cavitation operation conditions are distinguished by cyclic spectra analysis. Characteristic components are innovatively extracted at specific frequencies to avoid the effect from modulated and noise components in vibration signals. And the results about recognition of different types of faults could provide important evidences for fault detection during pump operation. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041830344

However, it would be interesting to investigate the alternative methods to bring down these requirements using the principle of sparse signal processing. In this paper, a low-complexity fault detection algorithm based on the sub-Nyquist sampling of the analytic current signal has been proposed and compared to other similar algorithms. The acquired current data is first converted into an analytic signal using a low-cost time-shift-based method. The processing of the analytic current signal has been performed at a rate 20 times lower than the Nyquist criterion using multicoset sampling technique. The computational complexity has been reduced further by partially reconstructing the spectrum only for the regions of interest. The regions of interest were found out from the estimated supply frequency and the armature current magnitude. The supply frequency has been estimated from the transformed analytic current signal. The algorithm has been tested for broken rotor bar (BRB), eccentricity, and broken bearing faults, using the recorded data from a 22-kW induction motor drive at various loading conditions in the laboratory. In addition, the BRB fault has also been tested for motors with 1.5- and 3.7-kW ratings. A receiver operating characteristic curve has been generated to test the performance of the algorithm.

Because of the abrasive nature, the impellers inside the pumps wear easily. Severe impeller wear may cause unexpected pump failure that leads to substantial oil production loss. To assess the impeller performance degradation and then estimate its remaining useful life (RUL), an efficient prognostic method has been designed. For assessing the impeller performance degradation, statistical features were extracted from vibration signals collected from on-site operating slurry pumps. Their corresponding frequency spectra were generated after the vibration signals were processed by a low-pass filter. Here, the low-pass filter aims to retain impeller-related vibration components, such as the pump vane-passing frequency and its harmonics. Principal component analysis was then applied to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features to one dimensionality, which was used to construct a health indicator to reflect the health evolution of the impeller over time. For estimating the impeller's RUL, a nonlinear state space model was designed to track its temporal health indicator. An efficient unscented transform method was employed to iteratively estimate the joint posterior probability density function of the parameters of the nonlinear state space model. After the proper nonlinear state space model had been determined, extrapolations of the nonlinear state space model to a specified alert threshold were used to estimate the impeller's RUL. Vibration signals captured from on-site operating slurry pumps were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed prognostic method. The results show that prediction accuracy of the estimated RULs have been improved as compared to those generated by other recently developed slurry pump prognostic methods. Moreover, the more the temporal vibration data is available, the better the performance of the state space model; hence, the higher the accuracy in predicting the impeller's RUL. © The Author(s) 2015.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021060383

Also, in a CP it is not only important to identify a fault, but it is also important to find the severity of it. In this research, causes of flow instabilities like, the blockage faults, impeller defects, pitted cover plate faults and dry runs are considered with varying severity. These faults are considered both independently and also in combinations with blockage faults. The CP vibration data and the motor line current data in time domain are used for the purpose of fault classification. The multi-fault diagnosis is attempted with the help of support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A fivefold cross-validation technique is used for the selection of optimum SVM hyper parameters. Wrapper model is used to select the best statistical feature(s). Novel features which give the best fault prediction performance of CP faults have been brought out in this work. The fault prediction from the experiments and the established approaches, aid the segregation of all the individual faults, fault combinations and their severities with promising execution, not only at the same training and testing speeds but also at the intermediate and overlying test speeds. The fault prediction of developed methodology has been inspected at various operating conditions of the CP and is found to be remarkably robust. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057057258

The parameter sparsity is imposed to deal with the performance degradation of OAA-SVM model as a result of the imbalanced dataset.

The reliability of petroleum artificial lifting systems that use Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) depends substantially on the performance of these pumps.

In recent years, real-time technologies based on machine learning algorithms have gained importance due to the capability to take advantage of historical data for future predictions. The present work proposes a particular assembly of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for the detection and classification of incipient faults in a pumping system.

Faults on critical components, such as large pumping systems, can lead to material damage and opportunity losses. Pumps plays an essential role in various industries and as such clever maintenance can ensure cost reductions and high availability. Prognostics and Health Management, PHM, is the study utilizing data to estimate the current and future conditions of a system. Within the field of PHM, Predictive Maintenance, PdM, has been gaining increased attention. Data-driven models can be built to estimate the remaining-useful-lifetime of complex systems that would be difficult to identify by man. With the increased attention that the Predictive Maintenance field is receiving, review papers become increasingly important to understand what research has been conducted and what challenges need to be addressed. This paper does so by initially conceptualising the PdM field. A structured overview of literature in regard to application within PdM is presented, before delving into the domain of thermal power plants and pump systems. Finally, related challenges and trends will be outlined. This paper finds that a large number of experimental data-driven models have been successfully deployed, but the PdM field would benefit from more industrial case studies. Furthermore, investigations into the scale-ability of models would benefit industries that are looking into large-scale implementations. Here, examining a method for automatic maintenance of the developed model will be of interest.

As presented in this paper, the pump station is broken down to subsystems where each subsystem consists of several nodes with its own TCI value. The overall pump station's TCI number is then computed by aggregating a weighted sum of all the subsystems' TCIs. A method for early failure detection is also developed and is based on combining energy balance law together with the nonlinear extended Kalman filter to estimate model parameters for both the heating and the cooling phase of the pump. The model parameters are directly related to the temperature change and will give an indication of degradation during the transient phase even if the pump is working properly.

This research presents a real-time monitoring scheme based on multi-sensor data installed on the machine. Case studies from this research were carried out on excavator units in heavy equipment rental companies. The Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) method is used to handle multi-sensor data. Multi-sensor data is grouped into normal condition groups and abnormal condition groups. The variables used to monitor excavator conditions include vibration, pressure and temperature sensors. Based on the results of the calculation of the excavator threshold conditions using the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) measurement technique, the threshold of normal conditions is (-2.137 to 4.121). In contrast, in abnormal accumulator conditions (4, 331 to 39, 458), pump failure (40, 956 to 138, 048), valve failure (2708, 104 to 3404, 187) and the threshold in the condition of the cooler failure is (10736.160 to 11434.151). This research shows that the MD-based CBM scheme produced can detect, identify, and isolate the failure of excavator components under study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086402424

Common problems in a running ESP system can be diagnosed by examining patterns in the measured data compared to values associated with a system that is operating normally. Using Fuzzy Logic, patterns associated with specific problems can be detected long before they become obvious. This information can be used to respond to emerging conditions before they result in downtime, or can identify why a system is not performing as expected. This analysis is applicable to ESP systems operating in a stable state, where normal measurement ranges can be determined.
