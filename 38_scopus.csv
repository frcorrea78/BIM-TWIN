With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960269657

The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle. Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis, awareness raising and education and training are important activities to address the challenges of BIM usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881611317

VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a re-assessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Second, we analyze the views of the enhancement of BIM implementation. Although BIM visions and promises are needed for BIM implementation, they need to be complemented with a more realistic view of conditions of the implementation. For this we outline an activity-theoretical and evolutionary view by drawing conceptual tools from science and technology studies and other relevant social scientific literature.

Expanding upon previous research, this paper focuses on individual BIM competencies, the building blocks of organisational capability. The paper first introduces several taxonomies and conceptual models to clarify how individual competencies may be filtered, classified, and aggregated into a seed competency inventory. Competency items are then fed into a specialised knowledge engine to generate flexible assessment tools, learning modules and process workflows.

The growing popularity of building information modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily upon the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project life cycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. Therefore, we propose an acceptance model for BIM in construction organizations using structural equation modeling (SEM). The key components, including the BIM acceptance model (BAM), are identified through a literature review about technology acceptance-behavior related theories, and was then consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on the components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, and engineers) in South Korea. A total of 114 completed questionnaires were retrieved. We used SEM for hypothesis testing. The validated BAM can serve as a foundation for positioning and comparing BIM acceptance research and provides users with a framework for evaluating BIM acceptance. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927950502

However, the perceived high initial cost of implementing BIM has deterred many industry professionals from adopting this technology. This paper aims to facilitate the decision-making process in the adoption of BIM by presenting the cost savings associated with implementing BIM. In many cases, an owner's willingness to pay for the BIM is crucial in the contractor's decision to use BIM. Therefore, in order to show the returns on the investment (ROI) of paying additional fees, data was gathered from three case studies on three sets of similar projects, with each set consisting of one recently constructed BIM-assisted project and one earlier, similar project completed without BIM. The potential savings to an owner choosing to invest in BIM as an additional service were estimated based on the measurable cost benefits associated with reduced schedule overruns, fewer requests for information (RFIs), and reduced change orders. This research confirmed that BIM is a worthwhile investment in the context of the company studied. In the three case studies presented, the ROI of BIM varied greatly from 16 to 1,654%. Additionally, the total number of RFIs was reduced by 34% on a small tilt-wall project, 68% on a three-story assisted living facility, and 43% on a midrise commercial condominium project, and the number of change orders was reduced by 40, 48, and 37%, respectively. Though an owner's decision to invest in BIM should be weighed against the scale and complexity of a project, this research suggests that savings may be realized regardless of the size of a construction project. The paper presents a systematic approach for estimating the ROI realized in adopting BIM using standard project documentation.

This aspiration represents a partial turn away from a focus on managerialist agendas towards a belief in the power of digital practices to achieve the aspiration of integrated working, collaboration and innovation, a trend that is being reflected globally in relation to both national and firm-level policy interventions. This paper subjects this so-called ‘BIM revolution’ to critical scrutiny. By drawing on theories of the digital divide, a critical discourse is developed around the ways in which political reform agendas centred on BIM might not stimulate innovation on a wider scale, but could act to disenfranchise small firms that are unable (or unwilling) to engage with them.

Survey data collected indicate that all five conceptual models demonstrate high levels of ‘clarity’, ‘accuracy’ and ‘usefulness’, the three metrics measured. They also indicate (1) varying rates of BIM diffusion across countries with BIM capability near the lower-end of the spectrum; (2) varying levels of BIM maturity with - the mean of - most macro BIM components falling below the medium level; (3) varying diffusion dynamics across countries with the prevalence of the middle-out diffusion dynamic; (4) varying policy actions across countries with a predominance of the passive policy approach; and (5) varying distribution of diffusion responsibilities among player groups with no detectable dominant pattern across countries.

Many studies have investigated the process of BIM adoption and diffusion and in particular, the drivers affecting adoption at different levels, ranging from individual and team through organisations and supply chains to whole market level. However, in-depth investigations of the stages of the BIM adoption process and the drivers, factors and determinants affecting such stages are still lacking. A comprehensive classification and integration of adoption drivers and factors is absent as these are disjointedly identified across disparate studies. There is also limited attention to the key terms and concepts (i.e. readiness, implementation, diffusion, adoption) in this area of study. This aim in this paper is twofold: (1) to develop and validate a Unified BIM Adoption Taxonomy (UBAT); and (2) to identify the taxonomy's constructs (i.e. three driver clusters and their 17 factors) that have influence on the first three stages of the BIM adoption process namely, awareness, interest, and decision stages, and compare their effects on each of the stages. The research uses: a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesisation to develop the taxonomy; a confirmatory factor analysis for its validation; and an ordinal logistic regression to test the effect of the UBAT's constructs on the BIM adoption process within the UK Architectural sector using a sample of 177 organisations. The paper is primarily intended to enhance the reader's understanding of the BIM adoption process and the constructs that influence its stages. The taxonomy and its sets of drivers and determinants can be used to perform various analyses of the BIM adoption process, delivering evidence and insights for decision makers within organisations and across whole market when formulating BIM diffusion strategies. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056829674

Whereas innovations affect and are affected by organizational behavior, they are better observed at a project level because they are shaped by a network of various project actors. This study connected intra- (micro) and interorganizational (meso) levels of BIM implementation. To explore the relation between BIM adoption drivers and BIM implementation in projects, three case studies were analyzed qualitatively through the theoretical lens of loosely coupled systems. The findings showed that although individual firms had strong external or internal BIM motivations and visions to adopt BIM innovation, the project networks rarely coordinated to support BIM implementation. Consequently, the project networks that were motivated by internal BIM adoption drivers (e.g., quality assurance) implemented BIM collaboratively and flexibly. Contrariwise, networks of firms that adopted BIM simply to comply with external demand (e.g., macroscopic market pressures or client demand) were rigid and competitive during BIM implementation and hindered knowledge transfer and innovation change management. Drawing upon the empirical data, other factors affecting BIM implementation and in need of further interorganizational alignment were corporate compatibility, interfirm knowledge mobility, and interfirm power dynamics. The implication is the need for further alignment of visions about BIM innovation decision making across firms to support effective BIM implementation in projects. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050195910

While many benefits (drivers) of BIM are mentioned in literature there is little by way of research to evaluate their importance. The objective of the survey reported in this paper is therefore to fill this knowledge gap by identifying and prioritizing the factors driving BIM adoption to enable those seeking to adopt BIM to gain an understanding of the relative importance of each of these drivers in order to inform their strategic and operational decision making. The research sample was limited to the top 100 UK construction contractors with international business activity. Online survey respondents were asked to score on a Likert-type scale of 1-5 the level of importance they would place on the identified factors driving BIM adoption. Responses to the online survey were analysed using relative importance index and rank agreement factor. The study concluded that those who had adopted BIM ranked the drivers for BIM differently than those yet to implement a BIM solution. Overall, the study found that the three most important drivers for BIM implementation are ""Clash Detection"", ""Government Pressure"" and ""Competitive Pressure"". The top drivers for non-users of BIM could be grouped under pressure from external sources while operational drivers were more important for users of BIM. © 2013 The authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890510999

As a factor leading to information system success and indicating the continuance intention after their initial adoption, BIM user satisfaction is studied in this work. Based on the data collected from 118 BIM engineers, this study examined the influence of five potential variables (such as attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, top management support and management by objective) on BIM user satisfaction in AEC industry. The result from PLS (partial least square) showed that the perceived usefulness, top management support and management by objective are significantly associated with BIM user satisfaction, and the influence of management by objective on BIM user satisfaction is much stronger than top management support and perceived usefulness. Besides, perceived ease of use and attitude have a significant influence on perceived usefulness. Moreover, top management support is found to be positive associated with management by objective.

Hierarchical regression results provide evidence that after controlling for related organizational characteristics (including organizational experience in participating in large and influential projects, organizational ownership type, organization age, and organization size), degree and eigenvector centrality in relationship networks in an earlier period as a group significantly predicts organizational success in winning new project contracts in a later period. The results also provide evidence that due to their differences in BIM capability and innovation reputation, the competitiveness of designers and general contractors relate differently to the structure of their project-based interfirm relationship networks, with the competitiveness of designers more associated with the quantity of collaborative ties, whereas the competitiveness of general contractors relates more to the collaborative ties with high-status partners. As an exploratory effort at using longitudinal data to investigate the associations between interfirm relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness in the construction industry, this study contributes to the construction literature not only by validating the value of project-based interfirm relationships in generating social capital and thus relating to organizational competitiveness, but also by providing evidence for how the specific association between project-based relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness is contingent on the attributes of the network actors. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040726482

However, there is evidence to suggest that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are currently lagging behind and are losing out in winning publicly funded projects. Guidance and frameworks to assist SMEs to make an informed decision about BIM adoption are currently lacking. There has been no systematic effort to date to bring together the results of research in SMEs’ BIM adoption. Consequently, this paper seeks to bridge this gap and provide a conceptual framework to give a theoretical foundation to the study of brokering risks and rewards in the adoption of BIM for project delivery. This framework is comprehensive and includes trading off risks and rewards associated with several criteria, such as stage of involvement, project value, funding, and the procurement route chosen. The approach has been validated by a representative sample of BIM users and the findings of the validation are also presented. The findings of the framework validation reveal that early design stage, project size between £5 m and £50 m, private funding, and integrated project delivery procurement are the best opportunities that enable SMEs to maximise the benefits and minimise the risks, when adopting BIM. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by VGTU Press and Informa UK Limited, [trading as Taylor & Francis Group].",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019174694

In spite of the recent decrease in construction spending, it is estimated that healthcare construction will rise dramatically in the next 10 years. Therefore, there is a great opportunity for improvements to be made in this market segment. Healthcare facilities are amongst the most complex facilities to design, construct and operate. Green healthcare can enable improved clinical outcomes, lower operating costs, energy consumption and water use. Lean principles emphasize whole process optimization through collaboration, continuous improvement, elimination of waste and a focus on delivering the value desired by the end-user (patients). Patients are a very special category of end-users, and their needs and health are the highest priority. The complicated healthcare building delivery system can benefit from focusing on the value adding activities and eliminating the wasteful ones. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be very beneficial for healthcare projects because of the complexity within the building systems in terms of indoor environmental quality, cooling and heating loads, and also the large quantity of medical equipment. This paper examines the synergies existent in the healthcare construction market segment in terms of greening strategies, lean principles and BIM during the programming and early design stages of a project to provide a combined benefit greater than the sum of their individual benefits.

In this paper, BIM postadoption usage behaviors are classified into two categories: exploitation and exploration. To investigate whether and how confirmation, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness influence BIM usage behaviors, the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) of information technology (IT) continuance was adapted for an empirical study, and personal innovativeness with IT (PIIT) was incorporated as a moderator. A questionnaire survey was conducted, and 151 samples from nine companies were used in the analysis.

This paper focuses on the technical and engineering perspectives of BIM and smart cities, by extending building and urban morphology studies as to respond to the challenges posed by Big Data, and smart infrastructure. The proposed framework incorporates theoretical and modelling descriptions to verify how network-based models can act as the backbone skeletal representation of both building and urban complexity, and yet relate to environmental performance and smart infrastructure. The paper provides some empirical basis to support data information models through building dependency networks as to represent the relationships between different existing and smart infrastructure components. These dependency networks are thought to inform decisions on how to represent building and urban data sets in response to different social and environmental performance requirements, feeding that into void and solid descriptions of data maturity models. It is concluded that network-based models are fundamental to comprehend and represent the complexity of cities and inform urban design and public policy practices, in the design and operation phases of infrastructure projects.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959208486

This paper examines the impact of building information modeling (BIM) and public private partnerships (PPP) on the integration between different stakeholders, project phases, and projects. It analyzes a single qualitative case study on a PPP project adopting BIM in Finland. The findings show that both BIM and PPP had a positive impact on integration on all three levels; vertically, horizontally, and longitudinally. There were, however, various challenges with both BIM and PPP that resulted in a negative impact on integration as well. The study introduces a paradoxical view on increasing integration with BIM and PPP. Thus, when facing projects with BIM adoption and different project organization models, managers should be aware of possible paradoxes between BIM and project governance model and plan the projects accordingly from the beginning. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863510551
