Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts. © 2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155167085

This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach. © 2017 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017566936

The findings raise fundamental, practical questions about the role of ubiquitous computing in shaping our future cities. The findings show that there are more challenges ahead than prospects, despite the fact that the u-city has all the advanced technological components for a positive development.

In some cases, cyber-attacks on critical industrial equipment are able to undermine the corporate business model. Knowing and evaluating in advance the main critical assets to be protected from potential cyber-attacks and the business impacts that could occur is a source of competitive advantage. Through the analysis of literature and an ethnographic research approach, this study proposes a structured classification of critical industrial assets within Industry 4.0 and potential adverse impacts on business performance due to breaches of cybersecurity. In particular, cybersecurity is analysed in terms of loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data associated with networked manufacturing machines. It is also suggested how critical assets and business impacts are correlated and how business impacts can be assessed. The proposed results can be organized in four steps for supporting companies in making decisions on cybersecurity policies.

Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case.

We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs.

BIM models are increasingly used as an object-based information hub for storing, integrating and managing building information in different aspects. Over the building life cycle, stakeholders - like the owner, designers and subcontractors - keep reviewing and commenting on different building components; but, these social interactions are often not recorded and managed in a structured manner. This paper presents a distributed cloud-based BIM framework that was designed to support collaboration among project participants and information sharing. The framework - namely, BIMCloud - was developed based on Apache Cassandra, which can be deployed on public cloud servers like Amazon EC2 or private cloud servers hosted in their own infrastructures. A schematic data structure was also developed to capture the building component-based social interactions which could be used for mining and post-processing to generate knowledge in the future. The BIMCloud framework stores BIM models based on the IFC schema and the developed schema for Social BIM. Therefore, people can make changes to the BIM models in the BIMCloud framework by transferring only a partial BIM model.

Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyber-physical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities. © 2021 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105588737

The IDP creates an active IDP session and stores its information in the user’s web browser. Each SP also creates and maintains one active service session. Using state-transition diagrams, we illustrate sign-in and sign-out processes. An information security vulnerability situation is created because users are unaware of an active IDP session in the user’s browser and signs-out only from SP sessions. One solution to this problem is educating users. Another solution is to implement the SSO that ensures the termination of the IDP session as soon as user signs-out from all services that the IDP authenticated. The first solution appears to be simple, but practically an impossible task to educate millions of web based SSO users worldwide. The second solution is better because one good implementation solves the problem for all users. In this article, we propose several solutions for terminating the hidden active IDP session. Also, we review the data storage-methods commonly used for storing information of SP and IDP sessions in the browsers. Moreover, we propose a browser extension for conveniently and efficiently managing active SP and IDP sessions. In our proposed browser extension, we have recommended IndexedDB browser storage for storing active session information. We believe our proposed browser extension is simple, but efficient solution for eliminating hidden active IDP session. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..
