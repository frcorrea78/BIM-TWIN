As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development.

This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of socio-technical change. This article highlights that smart city governance is not a technological issue: we should study smart city governance as a complex process of institutional change and acknowledge the political nature of appealing visions of socio-technical governance. Points for practitioners: The study provides practitioners with an in-depth understanding of current debates about smart city governance. The article highlights that governing a smart city is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of information and communication technologies. City managers should realize that technology by itself will not make a city smarter: building a smart city requires a political understanding of technology, a process approach to manage the emerging smart city and a focus on both economic gains and other public values. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973345825

The emergence of massive scale spa-tial data is due to the proliferation of cost effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, development of high resolution imaging technologies, and contribution from a large number of community users. There are two major challenges for managing and querying massive spatial data to support spatial queries: the explosion of spa-tial data, and the high computational complexity of spatial queries. In this paper, we present Hadoop-GIS - a scalable and high per-formance spatial data warehousing system for running large scale spatial queries on Hadoop. Hadoop-GIS supports multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through spatial partitioning, cus-tomizable spatial query engine RESQUE, implicit parallel spatial query execution on MapReduce, and effective methods for amend-ing query results through handling boundary objects. Hadoop-GIS utilizes global partition indexing and customizable on demand local spatial indexing to achieve efficient query processing. Hadoop-GIS is integrated into Hive to support declarative spatial queries with an integrated architecture. Our experiments have demonstrated the high efficiency of Hadoop-GIS on query response and high scal-ability to run on commodity clusters. Our comparative experi-ments have showed that performance of Hadoop-GIS is on par with parallel SDBMS and outperforms SDBMS for compute-intensive queries.

In the language layer, SpatialHadoop adds a simple and expressive high level language for spatial data types and operations. In the storage layer, SpatialHadoop adapts traditional spatial index structures, Grid, R-tree and R+-tree, to form a two-level spatial index. SpatialHadoop enriches the MapReduce layer by two new components, SpatialFileSplitter and SpatialRecordReader, for efficient and scalable spatial data processing. In the operations layer, SpatialHadoop is already equipped with a dozen of operations, including range query, kNN, and spatial join.

Properties of topological relations are determined by analyzing the nine intersections to detect, for instance, symmetric topological relations and pairs of converse topological relations. Based upon the standard rules for the transitivity of set inclusion, the intersections of the composition of two binary topological relations are determined. These intersections are then matched with the intersections of the eight fundamental topological relations, giving an interpretation to the composition of topological relations. The result of this study is the complete set of binary toplogical relations which result from the composition of two topological relations between n-dimensional point sets embedded in an n-dimensional space.

In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model.

While the IoT deployment in the built environment is growing exponentially, there exists a gap in integrating these two in a systematic way through open standards and systems. From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models. The paper describes the design criteria, the system architecture, the workflow and a proof of concept with potential use cases that integrate IoT with the built environment.

Building Information Models (BIM) and geospatial technologies offer 3D data models that provide information about buildings and the surrounding environment. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML are today the two most prominent semantic models for representation of BIM and geospatial models respectively. CityGML has emerged as a standard for modeling city models while IFC has been developed as a reference model for building objects and sites. Current CAD and geospatial software provide tools that allow the conversion of information from one format to the other. These tools are however fairly limited in their capabilities, often resulting in data and information losses in the transformations. This paper describes a new approach for data integration based on a unified building model (UBM) which encapsulates both the CityGML and IFC models, thus avoiding translations between the models and loss of information. To build the UBM, all classes and related concepts were initially collected from both models, overlapping concepts were merged, new objects were created to ensure the capturing of both indoor and outdoor objects, and finally, spatial relationships between the objects were redefined. Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations were used for representing its objects and relationships between them. There are two use-case scenarios, both set in a hospital: ""evacuation"" and ""allocating spaces for patient wards"" were developed to validate and test the proposed UBM data model. Based on these two scenarios, four validation queries were defined in order to validate the appropriateness of the proposed unified building model. It has been validated, through the case scenarios and four queries, that the UBM being developed is able to integrate CityGML data as well as IFC data in an apparently seamless way. Constraints and enrichment functions are used for populating empty database tables and fields. The motivation scenarios also show the needs and benefits of having an integrated approach to the modeling of indoor and outdoor spatial features. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907326401

An inventory of the point cloud data management user requirements has been compiled using structured interviews with users from different background: government, industry and academia. Based on these requirements a benchmark has been developed to compare various point cloud data management solutions with regard to functionality and performance. The main test dataset is the second national height map of the Netherlands, AHN2, with 6-10 samples for every square meter of the country, resulting in 640 billion points. At the database level, a data storage model based on grouping the points in blocks is available in Oracle and PostgreSQL. This model is compared with the 'flat table' model, where each point is stored in a table row, in Oracle, PostgreSQL and the column-store MonetDB. In addition, the commonly used file-based solution Rapidlasso LAStools is used for comparison with the database solutions. The results of executing the benchmark on different platforms are presented as obtained during the increasingly challenging stages with more functionality and more data: mini (20 million points), medium (20 billion points), and full benchmark (the complete AHN2). During the design, the implementation and the execution of the benchmarks, a number of point cloud data management improvements were proposed and partly tested: Morton/Hilbert code for ordering data (especially in flat model), two algorithms for parallel query execution, and a unique vario-scale LoD data organization avoiding the density jumps of the well-known discrete LoD data organizations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While such requirements cannot be satisfied via independent use of BIM or GIS, their integration can potentially be used for this purpose. The current BIM-GIS integration methods, however, are limited or application-specific. Therefore they fall short in satisfying the micro-level FDA information requirements.

ST-Hadoop is a comprehensive extension to Hadoop and SpatialHadoop that injects spatio-temporal data awareness inside each of their layers, mainly, language, indexing, and operations layers. In the language layer, ST-Hadoop provides built in spatio-temporal data types and operations. In the indexing layer, ST-Hadoop spatiotemporally loads and divides data across computation nodes in Hadoop Distributed File System in a way that mimics spatio-temporal index structures, which result in achieving orders of magnitude better performance than Hadoop and SpatialHadoop when dealing with spatio-temporal data and queries. In the operations layer, ST-Hadoop shipped with support for three fundamental spatio-temporal queries, namely, spatio-temporal range, top-k nearest neighbor, and join queries. Extensibility of ST-Hadoop allows others to extend features and operations easily using similar approaches described in the paper. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale dataset of size 10 TB that contains over 1 Billion spatio-temporal records, to show that ST-Hadoop achieves orders of magnitude better performance than Hadoop and SpaitalHadoop when dealing with spatio-temporal data and operations. The key idea behind the performance gained in ST-Hadoop is its ability in indexing spatio-temporal data within Hadoop Distributed File System. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049576414

Typically, a BIM model contains detailed geometric and semantic information for design evaluation, simulation, and construction of the building. If, as on the regional and city levels, more than one building is considered, the information content of detailed BIM models might be too high. For applications like noise simulation or emergency management, representing buildings as block models, reduced outer-shell models or simplified indoor models are more suitable. Such models are typically found in Geospatial Information System (GIS) applications.

While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time. © 2018 The Authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054102886

For accomplishing such sophisticate decision tasks, there is a large demands for building multi-scale and multi-sourced 3D urban models. Currently, Building Information Model (BIM) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are broadly used as the modelling sources. However, data sharing and exchanging information between two modelling domains is still a huge challenge; while the syntactic or semantic approaches do not fully provide exchanging of rich semantic and geometric information of BIM into GIS or vice-versa. This paper proposes a novel approach for integrating BIM and GIS using semantic web technologies and Resources Description Framework (RDF) graphs. The novelty of the proposed solution comes from the benefits of integrating BIM and GIS technologies into one unified model, so-called Integrated Geospatial Information Model (IGIM). The proposed approach consists of three main modules: BIM-RDF and GIS-RDF graphs construction, integrating of two RDF graphs, and query of information through IGIM-RDF graph using SPARQL. The IGIM generates queries from both the BIM and GIS RDF graphs resulting a semantically integrated model with entities representing both BIM classes and GIS feature objects with respect to the target-client application. The linkage between BIM-RDF and GIS-RDF is achieved through SPARQL endpoints and defined by a query using set of datasets and entity classes with complementary properties, relationships and geometries.

The traditional geographic information system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS) and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access.

Then the objects are assumed to be sampled at arbitrary but fixed instances of time, and their evolution between these instances is modeled by appropriate interpolation.

For example, Rasdaman was developed to handle raster data and GeoSpark/SpatialHadoop were enhanced from Spark/Hadoop to handle vector data. However, there are few studies to systematically compare and evaluate the features and performances of these popular data containers.

A unique 4D SFC key is generated from each xyzl with this library, and then only the keys are stored as flat records in an Oracle Index Organized Table (IOT). The key-only schema benefits both data compression and multiscale clustering. Experiments show that the proposed nD SFC library provides complete functions and robust scalability for massive points management. When loading 23 billion Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) points into an Oracle database, the parallel mode takes about 10 h and the loading speed is estimated four times faster than sequential loading. Furthermore, 4D queries using the Hilbert keys take about 1∼5 s and scale well with the dataset size. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051709103

Therefore, the development of a geospatial database is essential to characterize site-specific geotechnical information in multiscale areas and to optimize geospatial zonation methods with potentially high degrees of spatial variability based on trial-and-error geostatistical assessments. In this study, a multi-source geospatial information framework, which included the construction of a big data platform, estimation of geostatistical density, optimization of the geostatistical interpolation method, assessment of seismic site effects, and determination of geospatial zonation for decision making, was established. Then, this framework was applied to the Seoul metropolitan area, South Korea. The GIS-based framework was established to develop the geospatial zonation of site-specific seismic site effects before considering the local characteristics of site effects dependent on topographic or geological conditions, based on a geospatial big-data platform in Seoul. The zonal conditions were composed of geo-layers, site effect parameters, and other multi-source geospatial maps for each administrative area, and infrastructure was determined based on the integration of the optimized geoprocessing framework. © 2017 by the authors.

The proliferation of EO data poses great challenges in current approaches for data management and processing. Nowadays, the Array Database technologies show great promise in managing and processing EO Big Data. This paper suggests storing and processing EO data as multidimensional arrays based on state-of-the-art array database technologies. A multidimensional spatiotemporal array model is proposed for EO data with specific strategies for mapping spatial coordinates to dimensional coordinates in the model transformation. It allows consistent query semantics in databases and improves the in-database computing by adopting unified array models in databases for EO data. Our approach is implemented as an extension to SciDB, an open-source array database. The test shows that it gains much better performance in the computation compared with traditional databases. A forest fire simulation study case is presented to demonstrate how the approach facilitates the EO data management and in-database computation. © 2017 by the authors.

This leads to an issue in combination with geometry, as the geometric model necessarily has an underlying topology. In order to allow topological queries to rely on the incidence graph only, a new notion of topological consistency is introduced that captures possible topological differences between the incidence graph and the topology coming from geometry. Intersection matrices then describe possible types of topological consistency and inconsistency. As an application, it is examined which matrices can occur as intersection matrices, and how matrices from topologically consistent data look. The analysis of CityGML data sets stored in a spatial database system then shows that many real-world data sets contain many topologically inconsistent pairs of polygons. It was observed that even if data satisfy the val3dity test, they can still be topologically inconsistent. On the other hand, it is shown that the ISO 19107 standard is equivalent to our notion of topological consistency. In the case when the intersection is a point, topological inconsistency occurs because a vertex lies on a line segment. However, the most frequent topological inconsistencies seem to arise when the intersection of two polygons is a line segment. Consequently, topological queries in present CityGML data cannot rely on the incidence graph only, but must always make costly geometric computations if correct results are to be expected. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068617528

As IFC contains plenty of building information, further spatial analysis can be applied in geographical information system (GIS) with these information. Current research has mainly discussed the requirements about data translation from BIM to GIS. However, more specific requirements on the functionalities of a generic 3D indoor framework need to be considered with IFC data. Although this research is in the initial stage, we investigate the use of BIM IFC for the 3D indoor framework, especially on the data translation from IFC to the framework, data management in the framework and IFC data for 3D spatial analysis. Requirements are analysed in four aspects: 1) automation of indoor vector map generation; 2) data management for the framework; 3) environmental analysis of the framework; and 4) safety analysis of the framework.

The overwhelming volume of remote sensing imagery requires automated methods or systems for feature discovery. Existing research focuses on automatic extraction of isolated or elementary features, such as buildings and roads. It is rather understudied to discover complex geospatial features, which is spatially composed of elementary features. From the e-Science perspective, service computing technologies have shown great promise for widespread automation of data analysis and computation. The discovery of complex features would benefit from service computing technologies by computing spatial relations and their fuzziness among elementary features using geoprocessing services. The discovery process can be automated using an ontology approach. The paper presents how ontologies for complex geospatial features, enriched with fuzzy sets of spatial relations, can automate the workflow generation. Spatial computation functions, fuzzy membership functions, and mathematical fuzzy logical operators, are provided as services, and plugged into workflows on demand to enjoy the benefits of service computing technologies.

This exposes mathematical principles of spatial data design. The first consequence is a mathematical definition of topological ""dimension"" for spatial data. Another is that every topology for spatial data is an Alexandrov topology. Also, version histories have a canonical Alexandrov topology, and generalizations can be consistently modeled by continuous foreign keys between LoDs. The result is a relational database schema for spatial data of dimension 6 and more, seamlessly integrating space-time, LoDs, and version history.

Especially the handling of time as a fourth dimension usually requires terabytes of storage space. Therefore, an appropriate data management model for an efficient handling of such data is required and a key concept for any 3D/4D GIS. Within this paper, a comprehensive data management model is presented that optimizes the handling and storage of spatio-temporal data. The concept of time-dependent Net Components is introduced to handle regions that are monitored and modelled in individual time steps. Combined with the concept of Point Tubes the resulting data management model is used to manage spatio-temporal data based on d-simplicial complexes with dimensions d ϵ {0,1,2,3}. It is shown that the model is capable of handling various kinds of spatio-temporal applications. These include the proper handling of variable temporal discretizations of partial regions within a 4D model. The storage requirements are reduced and spatial as well as spatio-temporal operations are accelerated significantly.
