However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent trend in the manufacturing. Embracing the concept of 'Manufacturing-as-a-Service,' manufacturing is provided as service for users. Because of the characteristics of interoperability and platform independence, services pave the way for large-scale smart applications and manufacturing collaboration. Combining New IT and services, this paper proposes a framework - New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing (SoSM). SoSM aims at facilitating the visions of smart manufacturing by making full use of New IT and services. Complementary to the framework of SoSM, the New IT driven typical characteristics of SoSM are also investigated and discussed, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029168787

This paper addresses a version with hard time windows which is tackled by a mixed stochastic program with recourse and chance constraints. The recourse policy aims to deal with the costs generated when a customer time window is missed due to the stochastic nature of the problem. Moreover, the stochastic constraints guarantee a service level for each customer. A log-normal approximation is used to estimate the arrival times. The approximation considers previous customers failures to improve the estimation of the mean and variance of the arrival times. The problem is solved by means of a Multi-Population Memetic Algorithm (MPMA) and is tested on modified instances initially proposed for the deterministic problem. Furthermore, a comparison against related problems found in the literature is presented showing the performance of our solution approach. The results depict that the MPMA outperforms different methods with different types of objectives so demonstrating its efficiency and flexibility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052297425

It is a catastrophic disaster that consists of grain-fluid mixtures and moves rapidly across three-dimensional terrain. Most debris flows move downslope as fluids. To predict the runout distance and extent of the hazard area of rainfall-induced debris flows, we proposed a depth-averaged two-dimensional mathematical model, in which the debris and water mixture is assumed to be uniform continuous, incompressible, unsteady Newtonian turbulence fluid. Based on mass balance equation and Navier-Stokes equations, the mathematical model is derived using the method of depth-integrated equations. The finite difference method is necessary to solve the all equations. Based on GIS, the two-dimensional mathematical model of debris flow can be used to estimate the flow range, the potentially dangerous homes and roads for hazard and risk analysis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447330123
