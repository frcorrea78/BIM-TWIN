Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference.

AR applications are becoming mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on four technologies - localization, natural user interface (NUI), cloud computing, and mobile devices - which have the potential to influence the development of AR applications. Advances in localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence, cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful, and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101 research efforts, and outlines the research trends and opportunities for applying AR in the fields of AEC/FM. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878410881

However, full realization of these benefits requires specialized functionality, including top-down modeling, objects with functional behavior, the ability to embed contextual design intent, automation of layout and detailing and appropriate management of similar objects. An effective system must provide such functionality while maintaining adequate response times.

Such manual data record keeping is, for example, progress tracking measurements and reporting of daily work status and process flows. Recent research on material tracking has demonstrated that the implementation of automated material tracking technology is feasible. Studies have yet to demonstrate whether the same or other technology can be used on other resource types, including workers, and furthermore, in advancing technology that works bi-directional: (1) collect and analyze data, and (2) return automated feedback to the decision makers at the management or even the workforce level.

However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions.

It is applicable to solving interoperability problems and to compilation of models from point cloud data. The SeeBIM (Semantic Enrichment Engine for BIM) prototype software encapsulates domain expert knowledge in computer readable rules for inference of object types, identity and aggregation of systems. However, it is limited to axis-aligned bounding box geometry and the adequacy of its rule-sets cannot be guaranteed. This paper solves these drawbacks by (1) devising a new procedure for compiling inference rule sets that are known a priori to be adequate for complete and thorough classification of model objects, and (2) enhancing the operators to compute complex geometry and enable precise topological rule processing. The procedure for compiling adequate rule sets is illustrated using a synthetic concrete highway bridge model. A real-world highway bridge model, with 333 components of 13 different types and compiled from a laser scanned point cloud, is used to validate the approach and test the enhanced SeeBIM system. All of the elements are classified correctly, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach to semantic enrichment. © 2017 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028567303

However, it is not uncommon to see misuses of IFC entities during the creation of BIM. Such misuses prevent a successful automation of BIM-supported tasks because misclassification of objects in BIM can lead to significant negative consequences in downstream applications due to incorrect semantic information provided. To address this problem, the authors propose a new data-driven, iterative method that can be used to develop an algorithm to automatically classify each object in an IFC model into predefined categories. The algorithm consists of multiple subalgorithms with each subalgorithm depicting a pattern matching rule that uses inherent features of the geometric representation of an architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) object. The method was tested in an experiment in which IFC models from three different sources were collected and 1,891 AEC objects were extracted and divided into training and testing data for use. By comparing the classification results of the algorithm developed based on training data and applied to testing data with a manually developed gold standard, 84.45% recall and 85.20% precision were achieved in common building element categories, and 100% recall and precision were achieved in detailed beam categories. The sources of errors were found to be (1) different objects sharing the same geometric shape and (2) uncovered geometric shape representation in the training data. By adding locational information into consideration in addition to geometric information and making sure training data covers all geometric shape representations, 100% precision and recall can be achieved for all categories. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069052731

However, due to the lack of formal rigidity, data exchanges can often be arbitrary and susceptible to errors, omissions and misrepresentations. This research applied support vector machines (SVM), a technique of machine learning, to check the semantic integrity of mappings between BIM elements and IFC classes. The SVM was trained to distinguish model elements from a dataset of 4187 unique elements collected from six architectural BIM models, based on their geometric and relational features. Using a two staged approach, the SVM was first tested to classify the elements with respect to eight IFC classes. Secondly, the SVM was further tested to distinguish between the element subtypes within individual IFC classes. Results of high accuracy (ACC) and F1 scores in both stages attested to the power and generality of the algorithm.

The approach is based on comparison of the values of various characteristics, calculated for each equipment operation, against preset filters of characteristic values for all expected basic construction activities. The composition of the set of characteristics is different for each data stream monitored and is dependent on the nature of the construction activities. The method has the distinct advantage of ensuring the uniqueness of each filter within the collection of filters when the system is calibrated at the start of any project, rather than during online data processing.

The systems that produce complex, one-off products in mature, fragmented industries such as construction lack many of the typical organizational features that researchers have deemed critical to product development success (e.g., team familiarity, frequent communication, and strong leadership). In contrast, the complexity of these products requires a diverse knowledge base that is rarely found within a single firm. The one-off nature of construction’s products further requires improvization and development by a distributed network of highly specialized teams. And because the product is complex, significant innovations in the end product require systemic shifts in the product architecture. Riitta Katila, Raymond E. Levitt and Dana Sheffer use an original, hand-collected dataset of the design and construction of 112 energy-efficient “green” buildings in the United States, combined with in-depth fieldwork, to study these questions. A key conclusion is that the mature US construction industry, with its particularly fragmented supply chain, is not well suited to implementing “systemic innovations” that require coordination across trades or stages of the project. However, project integration across specialists with the highest levels of interdependence (i.e., craft, contract integration) mitigates the knowledge and coordination problems. There are implications for research on how technology shapes organizations (and particularly how organizations shape technol-ogy), and on the supply chain configuration strategies of firms in the construction industry as well as building owners who are seeking to build the best buildings possible within their budgets. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064432767

This processing of data typically causes the construction manager to be distracted from the more important task of supervising and controlling the project. Current trends indicate that the quantity of construction data will most likely continue to expand in the future, creating more of a burden on the construction manager. New, innovative data management systems that use the latest in computerized and automatic identification technologies should be developed to solve this impending problem. This paper offers recommendations for developing such a system for state departments of transportation. The goal of the system is to create, as much as possible, a ""paperless"" environment for DOT personnel involved with the construction program. This system will provide better data organization and flow, resulting in reduced paperwork processing time and more time for managing the construction process. © ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026898621

Given the cost involved, both for initial layout and for later rework where errors occur, researchers have sought to automate the layout task. Some have adopted marker-less augmented reality methods using heads-up displays or cameras, and others have proposed robots capable of marking out the works. The former encumber the workers, the latter are expensive to set up and are sensitive to site conditions, and neither has yet achieved the required accuracy. In this paper, we propose a more efficient approach to project relevant information from a building information model (BIM) onto the construction surface, directly augmenting the construction site with the design information. This is done using a portable system consisting of a 2-D laser scanner, an angled adjustable projector, and a camera. The system localizes itself within the already built outer walls using the laser scanner and the BIM model using a method derived from robotic mapping; it calibrates the projection correction parameters (keystone correction) using image analysis; and it projects the information with the angled projector. Testing results showed that the localization was accurate within a few millimeters and less than 3°, and the final projected image's error was approximately 1 cm. Initial calibration requires less than 1 min and does not require specialist skills. The system automates the layout task, preserves accuracy, and can provide rich model information on any interior surface. Note to Practitioners-Measuring and marking up of the interior works during building construction is time consuming and error prone. Layout must be repeated for each trade: Partitions, false ceilings, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and flooring and furnishings all require accurate marking of locations on floors, walls, and ceiling surfaces. Current automation is limited to the use of robotic total stations, but these only locate specific predetermined points. We propose a simple solution for automated layout, in which images from a building information model are projected directly onto the work surface. The system projects any desired information-drawings and images-onto the work surface (floor, walls, or ceiling) in the correct location, scale, and orientation. The prototype apparatus consists of a laser range scanner, a projector, and a camera. Projection of the work instructions directly onto the work surface is accurate and immediate. It saves the time required for workers to interpret and then mark up the dimensional information and it avoids the human error involved. The prototype is limited to environments in which computer projection is practical and currently requires planar surfaces. © 2019 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077511539
