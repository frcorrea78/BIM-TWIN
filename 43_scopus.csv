DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054374767

These data were compared to the energy use of the general US commercial building stock. We also examined energy use by LEED certification level, and by energy-related credits achieved in the certification process. On average, LEED buildings used 18-39% less energy per floor area than their conventional counterparts. However, 28-35% of LEED buildings used more energy than their conventional counterparts. Further, the measured energy performance of LEED buildings had little correlation with certification level of the building, or the number of energy credits achieved by the building at design time. Therefore, at a societal level, green buildings can contribute substantial energy savings, but further work needs to be done to define green building rating schemes to ensure more consistent success at the individual building level. Note, these findings should be considered as preliminary, and the analyses should be repeated when longer data histories from a larger sample of green buildings are available.

The most important decisions regarding a building's sustainable features are made during the design and preconstruction stages. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) is the most widely adopted sustainable building rating system in the United States. For projects pursuing LEED® certification, designers have to conduct in-depth sustainability analyses based on a building's form, materials, context, and mechanical-electrical-plumbing (MEP) systems. Since Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one model, it creates an opportunity to conduct these analyses accurately and efficiently as compared to the traditional methods. In this exploratory research, a case study was conducted on Salisbury University's Perdue School of Business building to demonstrate the use of BIM for sustainable design and the LEED® certification process. First, a conceptual framework was developed to establish the relationship between BIM-based sustainability analyses and the LEED ® certification process. Next, the framework was validated via this case study. The results of this study indicate that documentation supporting LEED® credits may be directly or indirectly prepared using the results of BIM-based sustainability analyses software. This process could streamline the LEED® certification process and save substantial time and resources which would otherwise be required using traditional methods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551681843

Nonetheless, we argue that the concept and practice of sustainable development (SD)-as guiding institutional principle, as concrete policy goal, and as focus of political struggle-remains salient in confronting the multiple challenges of this new global order. Yet how SD is conceptualized and practiced hinges crucially on: the willingness of scholars and practitioners to embrace a plurality of epistemological and normative perspectives on sustainability; the multiple interpretations and practices associated with the evolving concept of ""development""; and efforts to open up a continuum of local-to-global public spaces to debate and enact a politics of sustainability. Embracing pluralism provides a way out of the ideological and epistemological straightjackets that deter more cohesive and politically effective interpretations of SD. Using pluralism as a starting point for the analysis and normative construction of sustainable development, we pay particular attention to how an amalgam of ideas from recent work in ecological economics, political ecology and the ""development as freedom"" literature might advance the SD debate beyond its post-Brundtland quagmire. Enhanced levels of ecological degradation, vast inequalities in economic opportunities both within and across societies, and a fractured set of institutional arrangements for global environmental governance all represent seemingly insurmountable obstacles to a move towards sustainability. While these obstacles are significant, we suggest how they might be overcome through a reinvigorated set of notions and practices associated with sustainable development, one that explicitly examines the linkages between sustainability policies and sustainability politics. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation. © 2017 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030721949

This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The specific objectives are: 1) discover how interest and research in green rating systems have developed; 2) identify the similarity, difference, strength and weakness of green rating systems; 3) examine whether they fully assess the projects in all aspects of sustainability. Specifically, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Assessment Method), CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency) and Green Star NZ were analysed in this paper. The results indicate that BREEAM, LEED, and CASBEE have been utilized since late the 2000s while Green Star NZ is still in its earlier stages. 70% of the research papers focusing on BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE are developed geographically in the USA, Canada, the UK, China, and Australia. Although these four rating systems were initiated in different contexts with different standards, Indoor Environment Quality, Energy, and Material are core common categories for all. Environmental concerns are the main focus in New Construction manuals while Society is emphasized in Neighbourhood Development manuals.

In this scenario, several sustainable development indicators have been proposed. The worldwide diffusion of sustainability rating systems and that of their structures are considered as proxy variables for the evaluation of sustainable constructions. Available rating systems span from energy consumption evaluation systems to life cycle analysis and total quality assessment systems. In these last systems, a multi-dimensional approach is proposed, as several building ratings are evaluated separately before being considered together. The description of assessment results from a sample of 490 buildings provides data to discuss construction characteristics that, currently, aim at being defined as sustainable. The paper shows that building energy performance is considered the most important criterion in sustainability rating systems, and the least achieved one in sustainability assessments.

It is recognized that public attitudes and views towards green building may affect its application in daily lives, although studies on consumers' cognition are rarely carried out. The social problems related to green building such as consumer's basic understanding, purchase intention, social and humanistic needs, public attitudes and behaviors, rebound effects and furthermore social acceptance are therefore studied, based on three research methods including literature review, questionnaire and inductive analysis. Through the analysis, following results can be obtained: (i) green building's sustainable design has quite important influence over consumers' decision making process. The general public maintains a high regard for the advantages of green building, where better ventilation and lighting is a major benefit, saving energy and water are the second rated, and then land and construction material saving. (ii) Although the general public is not being familiar with the concept of green building, the majority of participants would pay more for green buildings over the standard building when they know the environmental impacts of them. (iii) Green building should not only be limited to energy performance-oriented, but also be user-oriented, the social and humanistic needs model is thus well established based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. In the life cycle of green building, social and humanistic needs show a trend of dynamics, which means social processes with consumer engagement and participation needs to be considered in aspects of conceptual design, planning and design, operation and maintenance to improve users' happiness and productivity. (iv)Current user-oriented solutions to green building are always based on a hypothesis that consumers are readily motivated or prefer expensive goods for reducing energy use, to really reflect preference and influenced actions, social acceptance should be analyzed to fully gauge interest and perspective of the people. (v) Rebound effects of post-occupant building performance, including energy performance, human comfort, indoor environmental quality, greenhouse gas emission and workplace productivity can be divided into two stages. At present, it is necessary to establish appropriate samples, methods and parameters for an unbiased and valid post-occupant evaluation system.

From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models.

To achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, from which 15 prevailing GBRSs were identified. The review reported that the earliest GBRS was launched in the 1990s and then a surge occurred in the 2000s. It also revealed that a large number of particular versions of GBRSs had been created to assess the sustainability of different types of built structures or the projects at different stages. Moreover, the review identified seven essential evaluation criteria that were commonly used by different GBRSs, and found that the most important evaluation criterion was “energy” followed by “site” “indoor environment” “land and outdoor environment” “material” “water” and “innovation.” Additionally, this paper revealed the major research efforts conducted by the existing GBRS studies and proposed the directions for the future research as well. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042703043

While “going green” is more likely to be seen as profitable from the building life cycle perspective, economic viability, from the perspective of developers and occupants, remains unclear due to information, behavior and policy factors.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach.

First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design.

Existing BIM-based green building evaluation techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the ""green template"") for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials. Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2D takeoff), and its reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of ≤5%.

To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952333230

It is difficult to account for this uncertainty in the design phase when operational and occupancy profiles are unknown. The relevant “performance gap” usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance is clearly connected to biased assumptions in modeling, especially in the initial design phase. A probabilistic modeling approach is proposed to improve simulation reliability and robustness with respect to variability in occupancy patterns. The case study presented is the eLUX lab of the “Smart Campus” of Brescia University in Italy. Occupancy dependent input parameters such as air change rates (i.e. mechanically controlled ventilation) and internal heat gains (i.e. due to people, lighting and appliances) are described by means of probability distributions to obtain probabilistic thermal demand and load profiles as output. Probabilistic results enables a more reliable identification of energy saving strategies (operational and environmental settings) with respect to highly variable operating conditions. Further, simulation data are processed to obtain a weather-adjusted energy demand visualization, suitable for establishing a continuity between modeling in design and operation phases, with calibration purpose. Calibrated energy models can be used for several specific tasks in the operation phase, in particular condition monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, supervisory control and energy management. For the case study presented, a detailed data acquisition scheme has been designed to enable an effective monitoring activity in the operation phase, aimed at experimenting model-based approaches for the tasks reported. The proposed research is the point-of-departure for a general activity aimed at assessing critically the issues of reliability and robustness of simulation results obtained with conventional modeling approaches, in particular with respect to occupants’ behaviour, exploiting at the same time the possibility of using measured data as a direct feedback to promote behavioural change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978039449

Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin-enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio.

As of 2013, for example, there were over 13,000 green buildings certified with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) in the United States alone. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and computer simulations are adopted largely for green building design. However, while information sharing and automated, collaborative design review are important for the design of green buildings, the current way of BIM-based green building design relies mainly on individual file transfer and does not support collaboration in the distributed environment of construction projects. On the other hand, as the Internet becomes ubiquitous, the web provides convenient and cost-efficient means for multi-location cross-organizational collaboration. Energy analysis and validation against standard building codes are two major processes in green building design evaluation. This paper presents a modular web service based framework which integrates the information necessary for green building design, automates the building design evaluation processes, and facilitates simple updates on the building model on a common but distributed platform. This framework is based on BIM data models like gbXML (Green Building XML) which contain information for green building design like geometry of the building, material, and sensor information from more than one source. The BIM data models act as a single source of building information for all processes. Building design evaluation and updating are iterative in green building design and require information and inputs dispersed among various project participants. Since our framework follows a distributed architecture and is easily accessible from the Internet, it makes the information required to facilitate the iterative process and its results conveniently available to a multi-participant environment.

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059346336

There exist today several possible strategies to model building performance through the life cycle. The increase of available computational capacity and of data acquisition capability is opening new scenarios for practical applications, which can contribute to the reduction of the gap usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance. This article aims to investigate an approach for probabilistic building performance simulation to be used across life cycle phases, employing reduced-order models for performance monitoring and energy management. The workflow proposed aims to establish a continuity among design and operation phases. Design phase simulation is generally subject to relevant temporal and economic constraints and a successful workflow should incorporate elements from current design practices but should also add new features, which have to be reasonably automated to reduce additional effort. Therefore, the workflow proposed is automated and tested for robustness using Monte Carlo technique. In the design phase, the approach can be used for identifying probabilistic performance bounds suitable for risk analysis in energy efficiency investments, employing cost-optimal or life cycle cost accounting methodologies. In the operation phase, it can be used for performance monitoring and energy management based on daily energy consumption analysis, similarly to other multivariate regression-based methods at the state of the art, addressing the problem of maintaining energy consumption and related costs constantly under control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019441541

LEED is the most widely used certificate worldwide. However, recently some critics have raised doubts about LEED and whether it actually implies sustainability. Most of the criticism has been targeted to the energy aspects of LEED. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the usefulness of LEED: is it really beneficial for the environment, and is it worth of the money and time invested on the certification process? In this study a critical analysis of the literature to find an answer to this question is presented. Altogether 44 peer reviewed articles dealing with the abovementioned issue were selected out of 164 search result. Based on the studied material, the different aspects of LEED from the viewpoint of energy-efficiency are discussed. From the 44 reviewed articles, ten articles state that LEED certificate indicates energy efficiency while eight papers end up with an opposite conclusion. The rest of the papers do not take any stand on this matter. The study showed that energy efficiency of LEED-certified buildings is questionable especially at lower levels, i.e., certified.

As a complete information model, a digital twin integrates the information of a project from different stages of the life cycle into a model, in order to facilitate better asset management and communicate through data visualizations with participants. This paper unprecedently introduces a digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station. Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the project is the highest, accounting for 78% of the total cost. However, the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is higher than the amount during the production of building materials, accounting for 67%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66% of the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73% and 17.64%, respectively. In addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life cycle cost and carbon footprint.

The value chain of an uninterrupted information for energy models based on design data (e.g. for new buildings) or on paper documents and additional surveys (e.g. for existing buildings) is crucial to perform a reliable design optioneering process. The present research applies a BIM2BEM approach to provide a public administration with a model for facility management (i.e. BIM) and a model to assess energy improvement and check the choices (i.e. BEM), as a pilot project on school buildings renovation. Schools are frequently out-of-date buildings in harsh need of structural and energy refurbishment and public administrations require consistent economic evaluations considering the payback time of the proposed solutions. Additionally, O&M (Operation & Maintenance) costs should be included in a life cycle evaluation of the buildings.

The workflow empowers the energy simulation results highlighting the accuracy of energy modelling in different situations and it introduces possible tuning strategies to decrease uncertainty. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

Research works in this direction mention that with 1000 ppm of CO2 concentration, a reduction of the users' cognitive performance about 11-23% is reported and, for a concentration of 2500 ppm, the decrease reaches 44-94% compared to the performance at 600 ppm. Consequently, a correct buildings ventilation is crucial. The use of mechanical systems seems possibly to avoid the problem but indeed the existing buildings often have outdated and not flexible systems to face changing needs. Thereby, the ventilation rates are not related to people density and the static setup of HVAC systems might be an issue to maintain an acceptable level of CO2 concentration. Moreover, in school buildings, mechanical ventilation is not diffusely adopted and insufficient rates of fresh air supplied to the classrooms are connected with inappropriate IAQ, occurrence of SBS symptoms among pupils. Current technology provides easy measurement of CO2 through dedicated sensors networks. The present research uses the pilot educational building eLUX, located in the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia, to investigate the possibility to integrate IAQ data generated by IoT sensors to improve the estimation of occupancy rate in the educational spaces. The aim is to underline the relevance of the parameter to regulate properly the HVAC systems and to define opening/closing patterns for automated windows to enhance IAQ. The data collected during the monitoring phase are useful to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that through an IoT communication protocol could actuate the ventilation rate control. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074440898

The methodology includes an efficient information management process in a BIM-oriented framework. BIM processes are frequently considered too much expensive and effort consuming for being applied in the retrofit or in the management of existing buildings because they demand a lot of data. The proposed methodology is founded on the idea that a COBie collection of spreadsheets is a BIM model even if it does not have any 3D geometrical information, which are often very expensive to collect for existing buildings. The COBie model may be populated of data coming from different sources, like the analysis of existing documents, inexpensive visual survey, interviews with peoples living the asset, etc.. The COBie model is used to store both information to be used in sustainability rating and the (partial) results coming from calculations. The methodology is presented here with the help of a case study: the rating of an existing building in the north of Italy, currently used as a private gym, using the CESBA protocol. The existing documents, managed in a Document Management System, have been analyzed and then all the information needed for the CESBA protocol have been transferred to the COBie spreadsheet, being able to satisfy (in terms of data requirements) the 85% of the CESBA criteria. The innovation in this research does not lie in the computation of the sustainability score itself, but in the way in which data both used for and obtained from calculation are organized, stored and shared among the stakeholders. The COBie spreadsheets, as well as the mapping of the sustainability data contained in them, allows for the creation of an Asset Information Model (AIM), even if not geometrical, well integrated in a BIM process. This methodology for sustainability assessment is well fitted in the BIM Bronze approach by UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to create and manage existing assets data in a BIM environment. Moreover, thanks to its simple but robust data structure, COBie data can be easily imported in current Computer-Aided Facility Management software. © SGEM2017 All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063108201
