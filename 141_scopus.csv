The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of “shape complexity,” one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given “model” shape and a sensed “data” shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. © 1992 IEEE",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026821209

The potential to improve on current construction methods is significant. One of such methods being explored currently, both in academia and in construction practice, is the additive manufacturing of concrete (AMoC). Albeit a steadily growing number of researchers and private enterprises active in this field, AMoC is still in its infancy. Different variants in this family of manufacturing methods are being developed and improved continuously. Fundamental scientific understanding of the relations between design, material, process, and product is being explored. The collective body of work in that area is still very limited. After sketching the potential of AMoC for construction, this paper introduces the variants of AMoC under development around the globe and goes on to describe one of these in detail, the 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) facility of the Eindhoven University of Technology. It is compared to other AMoC methods as well as to 3D printing in general. Subsequently, the paper will address the characteristics of 3DCP product geometry and structure, and discuss issues on parameter relations and experimental research. Finally, it will present the primary obstacles that stand between the potential of 3DCP and large-scale application in practice, and discuss the expected evolution of AMoC in general. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980338880

Timely geometric QA is able to prevent construction delays and cost overruns, maintain the performance of in-service facilities, and extend their service life. Geometric QA based on manual measurement has been proven to be time-consuming, unreliable and costly. Therefore, non-contact sensing technologies have been widely deployed for more efficient and accurate geometric QA. While a large number of techniques and algorithms have been developed in previous studies for non-contact sensing-based geometric QA, relatively little work has been done to systematically study and review their performance. This study reviews recent research on non-contact sensing-based geometric QA of buildings and civil structures in three project phases: 1) manufacturing, 2) assembly/construction, and 3) operation/maintenance phase. For each phase, the geometric QA is further categorized based on different QA purposes, including dimensional QA, surface QA, and deflection/deformation QA. Based on collected papers, two parts of analysis, consisting of 1) the adoption of different sensors for different project phases and 2) the performance of the QA algorithms/methods, are discussed in detail. Following the literature review and in-depth discussions, research gaps and future research directions are suggested, including improvement of QA techniques in each project phase, improvement of QA techniques applicability, and improvement of photogrammetry accuracy. This technical review is expected to have not only academic value by suggesting technical research directions based on the research gaps, but also practical values that allow contractors and subcontractors to automate and improve their current geometric QA practice. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059964352

While the HoloLens has sufficient real-time inside-out tracking capacity to provide a spatially correct and stable visualization of virtual content relative to its surroundings, the placement of virtual objects normally has to be done actively by the user. Beyond reliable tracking capacity, augmenting an indoor environment with corresponding building model data requires a one-time localization of the AR platform inside the local coordinate frame of the building model to be visualized. To this aim, we present a simple marker-based localization method for the HoloLens that is sufficient to overlay indoor environments with virtual room-scale model data with a spatial accuracy of few centimeters. Furthermore, an evaluation method suitable for the proposed scenario is presented, that does not rely on the HoloLens ""Live Capture"" camera which turned out to produce deviant placements of virtual content in relation to the perception of the user wearing the HoloLens device. © Authors 2018.

One possibility to capture the necessary 3D data is to make use of Mobile Mapping Systems (MMSs) which rely for instance on SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). In most indoor environments, MMSs are by far faster than classic static systems. Moreover, they might deliver the point clouds with higher degree of completeness. In this paper, the geometric quality of point clouds of a state-of-the-art MMS (Viametris iMS3D) is investigated. In order to quantify the quality of iMS3D MMS, four different evaluation strategies namely cloud to cloud, point to plane, target to target and model based evaluation are employed. We conclude that the measurement accuracies are better than 1 cm and the precision of the point clouds are better than 3 cm in our experiments. For indoor mapping applications with few centimeters accuracy, the system offers a very fast solution. Moreover, as a nature of the current SLAM-based approaches, trajectory loop should be closed, but in some practical situations, closing the local trajectory loop might not be always possible. Our observation reveals that performing continuous repeated scanning could decrease the destructive effect of local unclosed loops. © Authors 2018.

The advantage of these methods is the value added through greater geometrical freedom because a mould is not needed to create the form. In recent years, research has focused on material properties both in the wet and hardened state, while less attention has been paid to verifying printed forms through geometry measurement. Checking conformity is a critical aspect of manufacturing quality control, particularly when assembling many components, or when integrating/interfacing parts into/with existing construction. This paper takes a case study approach to explore applications of digital measurement systems prior to, during, after manufacture using 3DCP and after the assembly of a set of 3DCP parts and discusses the future prospects for such technology as part of geometry quality control for the procurement of 3DCP elements for the built environment. © 2020, RILEM.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088263451

The current discussions concerning the method of Building Information Modeling (BIM) are driven by visionary and idealistic approaches. The emphasis is placed on the opportunities offered by the model-based documentation and exchange of project data in the entire project life cycle. On the one hand this vision is important, because only the promotion of numerous advantages of alternative und collaborative methods will lead to a necessary change in the construction industry. On the other hand these big pictures of future project realisation methods leave the impression that those ideas have nothing in common with the actual situation in construction projects. However especially general contractors try to benefit from the use of digital methods and generate own 3D-models for the cost estimation – independent of existing structures. In this report the current practice of a modelbased tender phase will be described to emphasise the special view oft he construction companies and the resulting advantages. Finally two ways to ensure a consistent digital chain are briefly described. Copyright © 2018 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.
