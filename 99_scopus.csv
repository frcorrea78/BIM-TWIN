With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed.

Analysis of bilateral trade data confirms the importance of infrastructure and gives an estimate of the elasticity of trade flows with respect to the trade cost factor of around -3. A deterioration of infrastructure from the median to the 75th percentile raises transport costs by 12 percentage points and reduces trade volumes by 28 percent.

Second, total global megaproject spending is assessed, at US$6 to US$9 trillion annually, or 8% of the total global gross domestic product (GDP), which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history. Third, four ""sublimes"" - political, technological, economic, and aesthetic - are identified and used to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects. Fourth, the ""iron law of megaprojects"" is laid out and documented: Over budget, over time, over and over again. Moreover, the ""break-fix model"" of megaproject management is introduced as an explanation of the iron law. Fifth, Albert O. Hirschman's theory of the ""Hiding Hand"" is revisited and critiqued as unfounded and corrupting for megaproject thinking in both the academy and policy. Sixth, it is shown how megaprojects are systematically subject to ""survival of the unfittest,"" which explains why the worst projects get built rather than the best. Finally, it is argued that the conventional way of managing megaprojects has reached a ""tension point,"" in which tradition is being challenged and reform is emerging. © 2014 by the Project Management Institute.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898737377

However, the estimates of magnitudes and direction of economic impacts of infrastructure by various macroeconomic models are sharply different, and these models shed little light on causal mechanisms linking transport and the economy. This paper has two aims: first, to highlight the wider economic benefits of transport infrastructure from the observed role of railroads and waterways in economic development, and two by reviewing recent theoretical developments to identify the multiple causal mechanisms which link transport and economic growth such as: market expansion, gains from trade, technological shifts, processes of spatial agglomeration and processes of innovation and commercialization of new knowledge in urban clusters (made possible by transport improvements).

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure.

This decomposition scheme has the advantages of simplicity, exhaustiveness, lucidity of interpretation, and intuitive appeal. Its application to U.S. transportation data reveals that the growth in people's propensity to travel, population, and gross domestic product (GDP) were the three most important factors driving up U.S. transportation energy use and CO2 emissions in the 1970-1991 period. The effects of changes in modal structure were smaller, but not trivial. The actual increases of U.S. transportation energy use and CO2 emissions were substantially less than the sum of the effects of the above four factors due to improvements in transportation energy efficiency and decreases in the transportation intensity of GDP.

Therefore, this research aims to analyze and compare the adoption and use of BIM in infrastructure projects, particularly in constructing major road projects in Australia and the People's Republic of China. The related BIM uses and associated technologies of the projects were analyzed based on a case study approach. Subsequently, a number of comparative analyses were conducted on the cultural and managerial aspects between the projects, as well as different BIM uses between buildings and infrastructure projects. The results show both case studies had quite similar uses of BIM, yet the adopted managerial strategies and issues encountered were rather different. The evolution of BIM uses from buildings to infrastructure projects is also discussed.

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), one of the key technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) development, enables objects and devices to sense and communicate environmental conditions; Building Information Modeling (BIM), a revolutionary technology in construction, integrates database and geometry into a digital model which provides a visualized way in all construction lifecycle management. This paper integrates BIM and WSN into a unique system which enables the construction site to visually monitor the safety status via a spatial, colored interface and remove any hazardous gas automatically. Many wireless sensor nodes were placed on an underground construction site and to collect hazardous gas level and environmental condition (temperature and humidity) data, and in any region where an abnormal status is detected, the BIM model will alert the region and an alarm and ventilator on site will start automatically for warning and removing the hazard. The proposed system can greatly enhance the efficiency in construction safety management and provide an important reference information in rescue tasks.

The model combines use of conventional cost-benefit analysis to produce aggregated single point estimates, with quantitative risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation to produce interval results. The embedded uncertainties within traditional CBA such as ex-ante based investment costs and travel time savings are of particular concern. The paper investigates these two impacts in terms of the Optimism Bias principle which is used to take account of the underestimation of construction costs and the overestimation of travel time savings. The CBA-DK methodological approach has been used to apply suitable probability distribution functions on the uncertain parameters, thus resulting in feasibility risk assessment moving from point to interval results. The proposed assessment model makes use of both deterministic and stochastic based information. Decision support as illustrated in this paper aims to provide assistance in the development and ultimately the choice of action, while accounting for the uncertainties surrounding transport appraisal schemes.

However, coverage of the theory of BIM diffusion (which combines contextual and technical issues of the applications) remains scant and underdeveloped. Compatibility is one of the key contextual factors of Diffusion of Innovation theory that involves predicting BIM adopters' behaviours and identifying what components require extra effort for successful BIM implementation. However, this important theoretical concept has not been developed in pertinent BIM literature nor used correctly to extend existing knowledge because compatibility variables are not understood in a construction context. This seriously impedes the correct usage of BIM in construction. This study systematically and critically reviews BIM compatibility (BIM-COM) literature to distinguish compatibility issues at the organisational level and the concept of interoperability at the technical level. A sample of 57 out of the 131 articles constituted secondary data and each paper represented the unit of analysis. Bibliographic analysis techniques were used to identify co-authoring network and contents' concentration in the created bibliography. Content analysis and text mining approaches were employed using a thematic clustering analysis for grouping authors and themes within articles. The findings illustrate that the concept of compatibility is surprisingly poorly understood and often overlooked in the literature. The paper argues that interoperability issues prevail as the key practical barrier to BIM implementation. The paper identifies a large knowledge gap in terms of improving compatibility measures, which should be employed by innovators to assess their BIM applications before they offer it to construction companies. The findings presented will help to extend BIM applications and speed up the adoption rate among stakeholders with different needs and using different file formats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078567856

Regional agronomic diagnosis has led to several major advances such as (1) the assessment of the effect of preceding crop and soil structure on malting barley quality in France and (2) the assessment of the effects of ploughing, nematicide use and fertilisers on soil properties in intensive banana plantations in the West Indies. Improvements have also been gained in methodology, particularly by the selection of indicators for assessing the effects of crop management, soil and weather conditions, and data analysis.

Like all major infrastructure clients, highways administration authorities are under pressure to use such platforms for better management of data that, in addition to creating other opportunities, allows improved life cycle management of asset data and predictive analytics. This paper aims to review such opportunities and the value that can be generated through integrated life cycle data management by leveraging Big Data and building information modelling (BIM). Design/methodology/approach: A literature review is initially performed to systematically gather information to identify and understand BIM as a collaborative platform. Data management applications in other industries are also reviewed. Interviews were conducted and two industry workshops were organised to understand BIM implementation challenges within highways development projects and the role BIM can play in bridging inefficiencies resulting from loss of information at handover phases. The overall understanding lead to drawing up user needs, gathering system requirements and eventually a system architecture design to promote efficient information management throughout the asset lifecycle. Findings: It is observed that data from the design and construction phases of projects can be used to inform asset registers from an earlier stage. This information can be used to plan maintenance schedules. Moreover, it can also be integrated with data generated from numerous other sensors to develop a better picture of network operations and support key decision-making. Effective road network management involves collection and analysis of huge data from a variety of sources including sensors, mobiles, assets and Open Data. Recent growth in Big Data analytics and data integration technologies provides new opportunities to optimise operations of highways infrastructure.

The relationship between access to multimodal transportation and safety in urban environment is complex, as non-motorized user vulnerability becomes a predominant risk factor when they are involved in a crash, even at lower vehicle speeds. This paper aims to evaluate the relationship between multimodal transportation infrastructure, expressed through the presence of multimodal facilities and user exposure, and traffic safety outcomes. Using Chicago as a case study, a comprehensive dataset is developed that significantly contributes to the existing literature by including socio-economic, land use, road network, travel demand, and crash data. Area-wide analysis on the census tract level provides a broader perspective about safety issues that multimodal users encounter in cities. Negative-binomial regression models with fixed and random effects are estimated to account for data overdispersion and spatial effects. Total vehicle-only crashes, total crashes with non-motorized users, and fatal vehicle-only crashes are modeled. The results show strong association between the variables related to multimodal transportation availability and usage, and both motorized and non-motorized crashes. Although simplified in terms of some spatial correlation assumptions, demonstrated methods prove to be a beneficial and computationally efficient tool for estimating and easily interpreting modeled relationships.

The paper firstly addresses the definition of intelligent pavement. Accordingly, the architecture of intelligent pavement is explicitly specified, which is divided into the following layers: information perception and acquisition, information integration and processing, integrated service, and energy supply. Then, the major technologies of intelligent pavement are highlighted, including information acquisition technology, information management and analysis technology, energy collection and utilization technology, self-adaptive technology, and cooperative vehicle and infrastructure technology based on intelligent pavement. Moreover, the design and construction methods of intelligent pavement are discussed. Finally, the problems and shortcomings of the status of current research are specified, as well as prospects for the future development of intelligent pavement. Results show that intelligent pavement is composed of specific structural materials, perceptive networks, information centers, communication networks, and energy systems that possesses various intelligent capabilities to provide services for humans, vehicles, and the environment. The development of intelligent pavement will help develop the road network potential and help it to adapt to future vehicles. In terms of the process of pavement information acquisition, the technical difficulties involved with the durability and practicability of sensors still need to be solved. Various energy collection and self-adaptive technologies of intelligent pavement should focus on low cost and high performance issues. The Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, and various artificial intelligence methods have broad application prospects in the monitoring and management of intelligent pavement. As a new type of pavement, the design and construction of intelligent pavement can be combined with building information modeling, modular road construction, 3D printing technology, and intelligent compaction technology to integrate a new set of construction technologies. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

As part of this, they invest extensive funds in large infrastructure projects which are challenging to deliver as they require an e efficient communication among different professions, in order to share information efficiently throughout the lifecycle of the project, thus highlighting the importance of standardization to maintain consistency and integrity during data exchange. Building Information Modelling (BIM) aims to facilitate the above- mentioned requirements by describing the life-cycle of the project and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the Standard for BIM that enables an efficient storage, management, exchange and visualization of information. However, there are two important challenges that need to be addressed: (i) IFC focuses particularly on buildings and provides limited support for infrastructure elements and (ii) the information exchange aims to describe mostly the construction phase; highlighting the lack of classes that refer to the operation and maintenance phase.

BIM modeling aims at bringing improvements to all design stages. The use of BIM modeling will also provide cost reduction and control, increase awareness to data, design information availability and usability in each phase of infrastructure life cycle. Although the advanced modeling of the building components and systems leads to advantages well highlighted by practice and literature, in case of transportation infrastructures a critical analysis could show if this design methodology carries out the same benefits. The limited availability of infrastructure components libraries and the difficulty in assigning parameters to the geometries of the objects (many of them with unique characteristics) have been frequently quoted as main obstacles to the BIM use for the transport infrastructures. With this background, the problem is to understand which BIM-for-building features must be preserved in the production and management practices of each infrastructure model (classes, information exchanges and relationship between the classes and the spatial decomposition). This work is focused on the study of the I-BIM methodologies for the transport infrastructures (in particular railway infrastructures), analyzing a case study related to the port of Venice. The upward trend of goods quantity daily passing through the port infrastructures, led to the need to expand the container loading/unloading ship areas and, at the same time, to find a new and faster goods exit from the port areas, compared to the existing railway infrastructures. The authors developed a pre-feasibility study to identify the railway connection between the new port station and the existing line Padova-Mestre and to evaluate the difficulties and the ripeness of available means for an integrated design with the BIM tools. © 2020 The Author(s).",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083455212

Research status and deficiency of transportation data standards were discussed from management and overall planning, data definition, data storage, data exchange and decision support application.

Considering nodes' heterogeneity, the elements in the system are identified as MS, VS and SN. The detailed routing algorithm as well as its initialization phase is presented. In order to accelerate response speed, a routing strategy with prediction is introduced. After receiving the packets from SNs, VS computes the target VS base on gathered mobility information. In addition, a data-cashing mechanism is utilized to further optimize the results. Compared with the existing mechanism for the same application scenario, the proposed solution demonstrates better scalability and less delivery latency.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894719073
