The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of “shape complexity,” one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given “model” shape and a sensed “data” shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. © 1992 IEEE",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026821209

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

Although each of these strategies was proposed under different circumstances, one of the common purposes of these strategies was to achieve the interconnection, interoperability between physical world and the information world of manufacturing and the intelligent operation of manufacturing. As one of bottlenecks to achieve this purpose, the communication and interaction between the physical world and the information world of manufacturing must be solved. To solve the problem, a novel concept of Digital Twin Workshop (DTW) based on digital twin was proposed. Complementary to the concept, the characteristics, architecture, system composition, operating mechanism and enabling key technologies were also elaborated and discussed respectively. On this basis, the theory and implementation of the communication and interaction between physical and information world of workshop based on workshop digital twin data were discussed. © 2017, Editorial Department of CIMS.

The term might have been coined some time ago, today the concept is increasingly being used in the field of smart manufacturing. Digital Twin provides advantages in different fields of manufacturing, such as production and design, remote diagnostics and service. Digital Twin relies on the continuously accumulated data and real-time presentation of the collected data to simultaneously update and modify with its physical counterpart. However, presenting a huge amount of collected data and information in a Digital Twin in an intuitive manner remains a challenge. Currently, augmented reality (AR) has been widely implemented in the manufacturing environment, such as product design, data management, assembly instructions, and equipment maintenance. By integrating graphics, audios and real-world objects, AR allows the users to visualise and interact with Digital Twin data at a new level. It gives the opportunity to provide intuitive and continual visualisation of the Digital Twin data. In this paper, an AR application that uses Microsoft HoloLens to visualise the Digital Twin data of a CNC milling machine in a real manufacturing environment is presented. The developed application allows the operator to monitor and control the machine tool at the same time, but also enables to interact and manage the Digital Twin data simultaneously, which provides an intuitive and consistent human machine interface to improve the efficiency during the machining process. The proposed application paves the way for further development of intelligent control process through AR devices in the future. © 2019 The Authors.

Context-awareness can improve the usability of such AR systems through adapting the information rendered to the contexts so that the provided information can be more useful to the users. However, many AR product maintenance systems lack an authoring system that requires little programming skills to create context-aware AR contents. In this paper, an authoring system, authoring for context-aware AR (ACAAR), which provides concepts and techniques to author AR contents for context-aware AR applications, is proposed. Using ACAAR, the users can add and arrange various contents spatially, e.g., texts, images and computer-aided design (CAD) models, and specify the logical relationships between the AR contents and the maintenance contexts. In addition, a user study has been conducted to demonstrate the usability of the proposed system. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909638833
