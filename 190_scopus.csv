However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing.

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019987476

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called ""health factors,"" or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs.

In relation to such a growth, many approaches that leverage dimensions of information stored in BIM model are being developed. Through this, it is possible to allow all stakeholders to retrieve and generate information from the same model, enabling them to work cohesively. To identify gaps of existing work and evaluate new studies in this area, a BIM application framework is developed and discussed in this paper. Such a framework gives an overview of BIM applications in the construction industry. A literature review, within this framework, has been conducted and the result reveals a research gap for BIM applications in the project domains of quality, safety and environmental management. A computable multi-dimensional (nD) model is difficult to establish in these areas because with continuously changing conditions, the decision making rules for evaluating whether an individual component is considered good quality, or whether a construction site is safe, also vary as the construction progresses. A process of expanding from 3D to computable nD models, specifically, a possible way to integrate safety, quality and carbon emission variables into BIM during the construction phase of a project is explained in this paper. As examples, the processes of utilizing nD models on real construction sites are described. It is believed to benefit the industry by providing a computable BIM and enabling all project participants to extract any information required for decision making.

As a result sub-standard products and services often emanate, which inadvertently result in rework. Typically, rework is caused by errors made during the design process. These errors appear downstream in the procurement process and therefore have a negative impact on a project's performance. The lack of attention to quality, especially during the design process, has meant that rework has become an inevitable feature of the procurement process, and the costs have been found to be as high as 12.4% of total project costs. Such costs could be even higher because they do not represent schedule delays, litigation costs and other intangible costs of poor quality. To reduce the cost and effect of rework, an understanding of its causal structure is needed so that effective prevention strategies can be identified and the effects of rework reduced or eliminated. A case study approach based upon deductive and inductive reasoning is used to identify the major factors that influence rework in projects. From the findings and with reference to recent literature, the concept of system dynamics is used to develop a series of influence diagrams, which are then integrated to develop a conceptual causal loop model that is used to determine the overall causal structure of rework. Once an understanding of the causal structure of rework events has been acquired, effective strategies for rework prevention can be designed and implemented in order to improve project performance. This paper contributes to study of quality in construction by capturing the complexity and dynamism of those factors that influence rework and project performance in a holistic manner. © 1999 E&FNSpon.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001187120

NVAE is considered the main contributor to schedule delays and cost overruns in design and construction projects. Microlevel analyses such as work sampling and resource balance charts have been applied extensively to identify and minimize NVAE. These methods can pinpoint unnecessary steps in a highly repetitive construction activity and are most effective when analyzing activities with low performance variation in each cycle. However, microlevel analyses lack the capabilities to deal with errors and changes that usually result in significant performance variations, although they are a major trigger of NVAE in design and construction projects. To address this deficiency, this paper outlines the development of a system dynamics-based model for analysis on a macrolevel. The model's application to a bridge project in Massachusetts revealed that it can effectively identify and quantify NVAE particularly triggered by errors and changes, and can capture the propagation of NVAE between interrelated activities. On the basis of results, this paper concluded that the developed model can be utilized as a management tool to bring a more comprehensive understanding of NVAE in design and construction projects, which in turn can lead to a greater reduction in NVAE. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892164429

Fuzzy mathematical models that allow the multiobjective optimization of project schedules considering constraints such as time, cost, and unexpected materials shortages were used to verify commonly used methodologies for finding the minimum completion time for projects. The research also used a heuristic procedure for material allocation and sensitivity analysis to test five cases of material shortage, which increase the cost of construction and delay the completion time of projects.

It is very important to be able to estimate the delay that would result from such severe weather because construction contracts generally differentiate between weather delays that can be anticipated and those that cannot. Only delays caused by abnormal and unforeseeable severe weather are granted a time extension. Normal and foreseeable weather delays in construction contracts are usually estimated as a monthly average of the severe weather days as determined from historical weather data, which are measured at the ground level. In high-rise building construction, however, this approach may be inappropriate because weather conditions generally vary with an increase in altitude and the height of high-rise buildings has become so great that those conditions can actually affect the construction of the upper floors. Therefore, weather delays estimated using this approach could be subject to this error. For such reasons, a simulation model capable of analyzing weather delays with consideration for altitudinal variations in the weather conditions is proposed for high-rise building construction projects. To achieve this goal, the literature addressing the types of weather variables, the threshold criteria causing weather delays, and the duration of weather delays was first reviewed. Then, a weather-generation model using a k-nearest neighbor time-series method and vertical weather profiles was developed to estimate the weather conditions at high altitudes. A simulation model was finally developed by integrating the weather generation model and a construction schedule simulation model by using a discrete event simulation method, and a case study was conducted to validate the results of weather delay estimation and to analyze the degree to which vertical weather variations affect the schedule of building construction projects. The contribution of this study is the proposal of a method based on a vertical weather profile that is capable of reasonably estimating weather delays in high-rise building constructions, and analyzing the pattern of weather delays in building construction projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969913334

One way to cut down the costs is through improving and optimizing the facility management processes. This paper aims to focus on the issues surrounding this. Design/methodology/approach: To demonstrate the application of the research, service management (SM) process which deals with the building services related requests from the customer, one of the facility management (FM) processes, is taken as the focus of this paper. The study applies the lean principles to the SM process to identify the value added and non-value added activities in the process. Process logistics flow is modified to comply with the lean theory. The collected data from six participating hospitals in Germany for the two months of the year 2002 are also used as inputs for the simulation model. Findings: Simulation is used to quantify the impact of the lean principles proposed changes on the system performance. The simulation analysis has proved to be an effective tool in the selection of optimum resources for the SM process in hospitals.

Despite the high level of uncertainty and risk involved in construction, current construction planning relies on traditional deterministic scheduling methods that cannot clearly ascertain the level of uncertainty involved in a project. This, subsequently, can prolong a project's duration, particularly when that project is high-rise structural work, which is not yet a common project type in Korea. Indeed, among construction processes, structural work is notable, as it is basically performed outdoors. Thus, no matter how precisely a schedule is developed, such projects can easily fail due to unexpected events that are beyond the planner's control, such as changes in weather conditions. Therefore, in this study, to cope with the uncertainties involved in high-rise building projects, a probabilistic duration estimation model is developed in which both weather conditions and work cycle time for unit work are considered to predict structural work duration. According to the proposed estimation model, weather variables are divided into two types: weather conditions that result in nonworking days and weather conditions that result in work productivity rate (WPR) change. Obtained from actual previous data, the WPR is used with relevant nonworking day weather conditions to modify the actual number of working days per calendar days. Furthermore, on the basis of previous research results, the cycle time of the unit work area is assumed to follow the Β probability distribution function. Thus, the probabilistic duration model is valid for 95% probability. Finally, a case study is conducted that confirms the model can be practically used to estimate more reliable and applicable probabilistic durations of structural work. Indeed, this model can assist schedulers and site workers by alerting them, at the beginning of a project, to project uncertainties that specifically pertain to structural work and the weather. Thus, the proposed model can enable personnel to easily amend, and increase the reliability of, the construction schedule at hand. © 2009 ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450210414

The fact that various elements of postdisaster restoration conditions interact with each other and vary with a facility's surrounding damage and recovery situations over time makes many stakeholders' comprehension even more challenging. To support immediate and appropriate facility restoration planning under changing project conditions, this study developed a hybrid system dynamics (SD)-discrete event simulation (DES) framework. In this hybrid restoration simulation, SD allows for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic features of various restoration conditions, while DES enables an in-depth examination of facility restoration operations according to external condition changes. By allowing two simulations to seamlessly interact together, this study provides key insights into postdisaster restoration, including how complex and critical restoration conditions change over time depending on facility types and subregions, and to what extent these conditions adversely impact a project's performance and uncertainty throughout lengthy project durations, especially when restoration work scope and processes vary with damage patterns. A test tool for analyzing the effectiveness of managerial policies is also provided by showing experimental results. For instance, a project initiation, postponed to avoid unfavorable restoration conditions, can be delayed to reduce the project's uncertainty by alleviating possible increases in wasted time and cost of running an unproductive site. Therefore, the major contribution of this research to the body of knowledge in construction engineering resides in the capacity for the developed hybrid model to make facility restoration planning and execution deal with project uncertainties caused by chaotic and disrupting external conditions. As such, unexpected delays and additional costs common for postdisaster recovery can be alleviated. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978906745

A comparison of the influences of classified design errors on the project revealed that the total cost of the design errors leading to schedule delay was 194.69% higher than that of the simple design errors and the direct design error costs due to errors leading to demolition and rework. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045103485

Design/methodology/approach: The risk parameters and performance measures applicable in the construction industry have been identified through extensive literature review and discussions with experts from the construction industry. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire was designed and 64 responses were considered. The list of 20 risk parameters and 32 performance measures relevant for a construction industry is reduced to five risk factors and five performance measure factors using factor analysis. IRP modelling is employed to examine the contextual relationships among risk factors and to rank them with respect to performance measure factors. Subsequently, the results of IRP model were utilised as inputs to SD analysis. The SD analysis is conducted for two models, namely, risk factor model and risk variable model to understand the impact of interventions offered by project management team on risk reduction and mitigation. Findings: The developed IRP model shows that the risk factor dimension “construction management” has a high likeliness to occur during the construction phase. Research limitations/implications: The research demonstrates an application of proposed approach for a typical construction environment and hence the results cannot be generalised. Originality/value: This research addresses real life complexities in construction project by modelling critical risk factors using an integrate approach of IRP and SD. The proposed approach would facilitate project managers to devise appropriate risk mitigation strategies for a construction project. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031801941

Few have attempted to explore the other capabilities of 5D CAD. Project cost control and schedule control are very important for successful project delivery, while existing studies on computer based project control tools have largely focused only on schedule control. This paper fills the gap by investigating the possibility of using 5D CAD for project cost and schedule control. Initiated by Woodside Energy Ltd, a prototype of a 5D CAD system has been developed specifically for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) industry. The system was tested with the project data of an example module from an LNG plant provided by Woodside Energy Ltd. The functions of the system include: visualization of schedule data and verification of cost in real time and facilitation of periodic planning and progress reporting. It is concluded that 5D CAD could be a very powerful project cost and progress control tool. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902124617

This choice process, the arrival process of vehicles and the service characteristics of the toll-booths, affect the queues and delay the drivers. In this paper, queueing at a toll plaza is modelled as a multiple-queue queueing system where the arrival process to a queue (toll-lane) is dependent on the state of all the queues. In the past, such systems have been modelled mathematically only for two queues and are not applicable for toll plazas with three or more toll-lanes. The proposed model determines the steady-state probability density function (pdf) for the queues at large toll plazas. This study is used to determine the number of toll-lanes or the length of the upstream queueing area required to achieve certain user-specified levels-of-service.

However, few studies have systematically addressed how and to what extent lean construction practices influence construction safety. To bridge this gap, a conceptual model is developed and validated using a system dynamics approach. The construction system in this model comprises four sub-systems (i.e., environment system, equipment system, management system, and employee system). Data were collected from 448 projects in China. Simulations were conducted to determine the correlations between five types of lean tools and the four construction sub-systems. The results show that: (a) 5S management has significant positive impacts on the control of key locations and facilities at construction sites, and contributes to the mitigation of environmental impacts; (b) visual management can significantly improve safety compliance and safety management; (c) just-in-time management has significantly positive influences on the safety facilities layout and formulation of the safety plan; and (d) the Last Planner® System and conference management are effective in improving safety training and the implementation of the safety plan.

Although the majority of these models take into account stochastic variation of the inputs, they do not necessarily take into account seasonal variations and other stochastic effects that might arise. One of the major applications of OR lies within healthcare, where ever increasing pressure on healthcare systems is having major implications on those who plan the provision of such services. Coping with growing demand for healthcare, as well as the volatile nature of the number of arrivals at a healthcare facility makes modelling healthcare provision one of the most challenging fields of OR. This paper proposes the use of a relatively modern time series technique, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), to improve existing algorithms that give required staffing levels. The methodology is demonstrated using data from a large teaching hospital's emergency unit. Using time dependent queueing theory, as well as SSA, staffing levels are obtained.

By means of the collected data from actual cases, four ANN models have been trained and tested for estimating the duration of installing column reinforcements, installing beam reinforcements, column concreting and beam concreting activities. Finally, a web-based program was designed and tested as an automated tool for suiting engineers to estimate the duration of scoped activities based on ANN method.

Allocation of human resources as an effective managerial tool and improvement factor in the progress of performing a project can strongly influence project performance in terms of cost and time. Therefore, allocation process can be improved by the estimation of labour need and assessment of different human resources allocation strategies.
