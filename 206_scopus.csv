This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion.

Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards-the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is based around two main themes-the publication and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: Architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments.

But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m′, the search algorithm transforms m′ by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m′. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions.

Appropriate or correct and suitable algorithms will fulfill its function fast enough, that is, to find an optimal path for the robot to traverse in, even if there are a large number of obstacles cluttered in a complex environment.

As the declarative knowledge is represented by a graph-based structure, an artificial intelligence method in the form of a heuristic search of this structure is applied. A modified shortest-path search algorithm used to calculate the optimal route with regard to costs incurred by the robot during passing through different spaces and opening doors is proposed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066750348

Within this work, a model-based method is proposed that relates human motion behavior perceived from RGBD input to the constraints imposed by the environment by considering typical human routing alternatives. Multiple hypotheses about routing options of a human towards local semantic goal locations are created and validated, including explicit collision avoidance routes. It is demonstrated, with real-time, real-life experiments, that a coarse discretization based on the semantics of the environment suffices to make a proper distinction between a person going, for example, to the left or the right on an intersection. As such, a scalable and explainable solution is presented, which is suitable for incorporation within navigation algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.
