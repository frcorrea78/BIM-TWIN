Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS. © 2014 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921300723

In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of the Digital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016457439

The paradigm shift in Intelligence indicates the ''new normal'' of cyber-social-physical systems (CPSS), in which the system behaviors are guided by Merton's Laws. Thus, the ACP-based parallel intelligence consisting of Artificial societies, Computational experiments and Parallel execution are introduced to bridge the big modeling gap in CPSS. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992153332

This issue has become a focus of recent vision computing research. Currently, the ACP theory that comprises artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution is playing an essential role in modeling and control of complex systems. This paper introduces the ACP theory into the vision computing field, and proposes parallel vision and its basic framework and key techniques. For parallel vision, photo-realistic artificial scenes are used to model and represent complex real scenes, computational experiments are utilized to train and evaluate a variety of visual models, and parallel execution is conducted to optimize the vision system and achieve perception and understanding of complex environments. This virtual/real interactive vision computing approach integrates many technologies including computer graphics, virtual reality, machine learning, and knowledge automation, and is developing towards practically effective vision systems.

Genesis, the system described in this paper contains large heterogeneous cases with metalevel knowledge. A multi-level indexing scheme with both preallocated and dynamically computed indexing capability has been implemented. A user interface allows dynamic creation of similarity measures based on modelling of the user's intentions. Both user aiding and problem solution facilities are supported, a novel feature is that risk estimates are also provided. Performance testing indicates that the case base produces on average, better predictions for new well developments than company experts. Early versions of the system have been deployed into oil companies in 6 countries around the world and research is continuing on refining the system in response to industry feedback. ©2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-21244471400
