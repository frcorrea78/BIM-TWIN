Despite its potential benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive systematic literature review and case study research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model.

BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions.

It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain. We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy. We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030479533

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062655898

Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066326523

This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic -the smart contracts- and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too.

A blockchain Technology (BCT) is, in essence, a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. It was introduced as the working mechanism that formed the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain extensive mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. It was evident that the underlying principles characteristic of BCT functional attributes and secure digital infrastructure could find application in nearly any conceivable industry. BCT aims at creating a system that would be a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring and cyber-resilient system that assures the facilitation and protection of truly efficient data exchange system. This research depicts a survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and examines the potential incorporation within the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process. Furthermore, the paper investigates how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM workflow by emphasizing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The focus on collaboration and the distributed nature of both technologies imply the suitability for implementing an integrative framework, and in extension, posit that effectively leveraging DLT's robust, reliable, and secure network infrastructure, and BIM workflow processes can be significantly enhanced. The paper examines the fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their prospective future applications and current advances, and their categorization based on intrinsic characteristics of consensus reaching and permissions. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the design review process such as using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas.

To address this issue rigorously, we consider it opportune to assess the current implementation and the associated improvement proposals, within a single coherent evaluation framework. This work addresses this specific question in the particular context of Ethereum, a prominent implementation of Blockchain, using a threefold approach. First, it maps the internal constituents of Ethereum onto a layered architecture inspired in the ISO/OSI model, so that its provisioning organization can be better understood. Second, it employs the AKF Scale Cube to analyze the pros and cons of the present specification of Ethereum, as well as of the current improvement proposals, so that the scalability challenges can be reasoned about in an orderly fashion. Finally, it uses an extensible test environment with synthetic benchmarks so that the transaction throughput of the current implementation of Ethereum can be evaluated in a private scenario, when no smart contract is to run. Our conclusions suggest that Ethereum respects the scalability trilemma being versed on security and decentralization renouncing scalability.

In recent years, the wide application and development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) promote the development of informatization and digitalization of AEC/FM industry. However, due to the limitation of a one single tool and lack of understanding of single source of truth, the problems of the industry cannot be solved completely. Therefore, the revolution and innovation of industry can be stagnated. Internet of Thing (IoT) and blockchain can be considered as two technologies that can be integrated with BIM for AEC/FM industry. The aim of this paper is to understand and analyse the basic principles and the applications of these three technologies in AEC/FM industry through literature review. With the integration of these three technologies, the virtual and realistic object and data during the whole building lifecycle can be managed and stored in a security, transparency and convenient decentralized common data environment (DCDE).

However, its utilization in resource-constrained mobile devices is limited due to high demands of resources and poor scalability with frequent-intensive transactions. Edge computing can be integrated to facilitate mobile devices in offloading their mining tasks to cloud resources. This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage. We based our study on peer-to-peer and blockchain to achieve an Internet of Things (IoT) design supported by edge computing to acquire security and scalability levels needed for the integration. We investigated existing blockchain and associated technologies to discover solutions that address anonymity, integrity and adaptability issues for successful integration of blockchain in IoT systems. The discovered solutions were then incorporated in our conceptual design of the decentralized application prototype presented for secure storage of IoT data and transactions. © 2019 by the authors.

Where the underlying business processes involve multiple independent parties, a blockchain platform can provide a common source of truth. If changes to the common state depend on IoT devices, the authenticity and integrity of the IoT input must be ensured. Employing a blockchain platform for authenticating devices makes the process independent of the device manufacturer. This paper shows how cryptographic keys derived from a device's physical fingerprint can be employed in a zero-knowledge protocol to authenticate a device. As the keys are regenerated at boot time rather than stored, the approach does not need an expensive secure element. An efficient implementation enables even lightweight devices to prove their identity and sign messages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084430776

Smart homes consist of home appliances and devices that communicate with each other to address the needs of the residents. These appliances generate, share and consume lots of data which are private and sometimes safety critical to the residents. Managing them is a challenging task. The current frameworks for managing home appliances are centralized in nature. Such frameworks force smart home residents to trust the service providers or a third party. These frameworks are also prone to hacking, compromise of data and a single point of failure. Availability of services can also never be guaranteed with such frameworks. Technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts can help to manage these appliances. In this paper, we study the scope of blockchain technology in smart homes. We propose, implement and evaluate a blockchain based approach using Proof-of-Authority as the consensus mechanism for managing appliances in smart homes. In addition, we compare the performance of our system with the traditional Proof-of-Work based system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067280779

This model includes main dimensions and critical contributing factors to assess the readiness for the iContract concept within the construction contract environment. Design/methodology/approach: Through an extensive literature review, the structure of a unique theoretical technology acceptance model for iContract implementation, within construction, was developed iContract acceptance model (iCAM). Relevant themes were assessed through the lens of the technology acceptance model framework and the four accepted dimensions of the technology readiness index (TRI) concept. The main components of the model were examined with selected practitioners, with relevant experience and understanding of the iContract concept, with thematic mapping of the discussions correlated back to 12 specific iContract contributing constructs of the four adapted TRI dimensions. Findings: The paper contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a novel iCAM for a trending technology based on the specific requirements of iContract adoption. The interviews show that while the desire to digitalise the contractual environment exists, the readiness of the sector for such a disruptive change is unknown. Practical implications: The findings and proposed conceptual iCAM offers a lens for the further development of the iContract concept by assisting practitioners to forecast digital readiness of the contract process in construction. Originality/value: This study offers a unique and theoretical framework, in an embryonic field, for predicting the success of iContract implementation within construction organisations through the digital, industry 4.0 and revolution. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081739920

The relevant information, regarding surface distresses too, is thus available in economical, high-speed and high-resolution forms, with limited disturbance on traffic and road agencies issues. However, the availability of such a mass of data poses interesting questions concerning the most efficient processing and analysis methods, for optimizing maintenance operation planning. Unfortunately, the PMS adoption is not very common and widespread, as they are significantly complicated and sophisticated, with critical consequences in their actual and intense practical use. Then, there is a need of simplifying the pavement maintenance process, by defining smart tools actually supporting the operators in the analysis and decisional phases. BIM (Building Information Modeling) procedures can absolutely represent a strategical solution. Indeed, BIM models, already widely adopted in the structural fields, have been recently introduced in the infrastructural design phases, simplifying the entire life-cycle of the construction, with representation clarity, mistake reduction, and money savings. However, although the BIM advantages have been significantly exploited in the design phases, pavement maintenance has not been directly involved in the BIM processes. Then, this paper focuses on a methodological analysis of the problem, aiming to propose a novel BIM-based approach for managing pavement maintenance. The goal is to define proper “smart objects”, based on specific relational databases, that may represent a more suitable instrument for handling pavement condition and quality information, in a user-friendly software environment. The potentialities of the modern survey technologies may be integrated and optimized in a BIM process, involving in parallel both design and maintenance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072107815
