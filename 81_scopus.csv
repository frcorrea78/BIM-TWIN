Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. © 2006 The Royal Society.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846995979

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

Emerged out of software engineering, the application fields have widened and maturity model research is becoming more important. During the last two decades the publication amount steadily rose as well. Until today, no studies have been available summarizing the activities and results of the field of maturity model research. Objective: The objective of this paper is to structure and analyze the available literature of the field of maturity model research to identify the state-of-the-art research as well as research gaps. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted. It included relevant publications of journals and IS conferences. Mapping studies are a suitable method for structuring a broad research field concerning research questions about contents, methods, and trends in the available publications. Results: The mapping of 237 articles showed that current maturity model research is applicable to more than 20 domains, heavily dominated by software development and software engineering. The study revealed that most publications deal with the development of maturity models and empirical studies. Theoretical reflective publications are scarce. Furthermore, the relation between conceptual and design-oriented maturity model development was analyzed, indicating that there is still a gap in evaluating and validating developed maturity models. Finally, a comprehensive research framework was derived from the study results and implications for further research are given. Conclusion: The mapping study delivers the first systematic summary of maturity model research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps. The proposed research framework supports researchers categorizing their own projects. In addition, practitioners planning to use a maturity model may use the study as starting point to identify which maturity models are suitable for their domain and where limitations exist. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

The evolution of computer-aided design (CAD) is used as the ""backbone"" for the assumptions made. The focus area of this paper is CAD and more widely digital ICT within the architecture, engineering and construction field (AEC), its development and available computer-aided design tools throughout the last 30-40 years. Architectural design is discussed in this paper from the viewpoint of complex design and construction projects and therefore the more complex information structures used in contemporary design and construction. Complexity has also resulted in a more complex, curved and ""free"" architectural building geometry, which has been enabled by modern CAD-tools. The main conclusion is, that information and communication technology has indeed enabled us to manage more complex building projects better and more comprehensively than earlier, and also more complex architectural expression can therefore be used in contemporary construction. Building product modelling (building information modelling, BIM) has been proposed to be a suitable method to manage all design and construction issues within current IT-oriented building projects and process environments. Product modelling is seen as a natural step in the evolution of ICT. Building product modelling is regarded in this paper to be a promising method to increase our ability to manage some more vague building and design criteria, such as design richness or even overall building quality.

The information system allowed the operators to make more effective use of the building control system and freeing up time to take care of other tenant needs. They report observing significant improvements in building comfort, potentially improving tenant health and productivity. The reduction in the labor costs to operate the building is about US$ 20,000 per year, which alone could pay for the information system in about 5 years.

They have the ability to take into account various phenomena ignored by one-node and multizone models, such as temperature and contaminants distributions, thermal integration with cold façade, draft, asymmetric thermal radiation, and cold or hot floor surfaces. Single and multizone models are inadequate to obtain information required for many applications because the fundamental assumption of heat and mass balance models is that the air in each zone is well stirred with uniform temperature and contaminant concentration. Zonal models are based on an approximate partitioning of a room into a number of subzones and have been used for modeling indoor and outdoor environments.

A novel interactive mechanism between the continuous internal degradation and the stochastic external shock damage is established on the hazard rate of the equipment with integrating the imperfect effect of maintenance. Two improvement factors are defined for the modeling of imperfect maintenance. The number of failures resulting from internal degradation and from external shocks are both mathematically deduced based on this interactive mechanism.

Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081715350

Various projects have been carried out successfully during the last years and demonstrated the power behind the overall concept - and the practical problems to reach the ambitious overall goals. Whereas the first steps of MBSE like the iterative modeling of requirements, designs, behaviors, and tests became standard procedures in Systems Engineering (SE), the transition to simulation often is still restricted to quite simple scenarios. Although elaborated system models deliver all the information needed, the simulation of the overall system in prospective working environments interacting with other systems is rather an exception. The problem is that there is still quite a gap between the first SE steps and the various algorithms simulation technology can offer today. Major reasons for this seem to be the resulting complexity of the system model when modeling complex interactions, the complexity of using state-of-the-art simulation technology and the absence of simulation frameworks for simulations across multiple domains and disciplines.

This paper develops a conceptual framework for a new paradigm called smart factory based on CPS by applying virtual-real mapping and fusion, digital twin, big data-driven, virtualisation, and edge-to-cloud service technology to the manufacturing system. The definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on smart factory based on CPS are explained in detail. In the paradigm, the digital twin merges the physical system modelling and cyberspace simulation to provide an intelligence solution simulation analysis ability. This generates a variety of digital designs of production processes, quality, cost, efficiency and environmental impact analysis about smart factory business mode in the preproduction phase based on big data which can be analysed, and provide authoritative solutions for actual physical space.

Also, the production mode is shifting towards customized production, and more rental resources or services are introduced to the production system, therefore, the systems are becoming more complex. Compared with traditional production systems, such systems have some new features, this work calls this type of system as a synchronized production operation system (SPOS). Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective). From both qualitative and quantitative aspects to ensure the system is under an optimal target path for optimal operation procedure.

Traditional simulation uses historical data as input for task durations. Data is fed into activity cycle diagrams which many times do not consider any of the rapidly changing spatial constraints that are present on a construction site. Very little research has been conducted towards more realistic, real-time simulation involving data gathering from live actors and documenting the effect of potential changes to such a spatial-temporal work environment. Methods: Cell-based simulation, incorporating continuous spatial changes to the site layout during project operations and real-time Global Positioning System (GPS) location tracking data from equipment resources, is introduced for more realistic and rapid modeling. The potential of analyzing and visualizing the effects of spatial consideration of varying resource combinations in earthmoving cycles on productivity and site congestion are explored. It provides insight and awareness in decision making for resource management, site layout and internal traffic control planning. Results: The proposed cell-based simulation system handles complex and more realistic scenarios. Various cell parameters were tested in a case study of common earthmoving operations. The advantages of the cell-based over a traditional simulation model include ease of visualization and simplicity in modeling spatial constraints (e.g., ramp restricting traffic to one-way flow). The system provides full control over the flow of resources by using predefined rules or algorithms. It simplifies the design process since, except for some certain key cells, other ordinary cells followed the same rules without being programmed individually. Future research may involve multiple, non-interacting crews competing for resources and study of time-space conflicts in more detail. Conclusions: The presented cell-based simulation system is able to model and visualize the cyclic activities of earthmoving equipment that occur on a construction site in greater detail than previous simulation methods have done. Using near real-time location data from equipment as input value in the simulation helps construction site project engineers, planners, and managers to improve coordination and monitoring of such construction resources. © 2015, Pradhananga and Teizer.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946591478

A DT creates a link between physical products and their virtual models with more comprehensive data and accumulation of knowledge. Therefore, a DT may be applied to enhance simulation, traceability and to support the offering of value-added services along the lifecycle. However, the definition of a DT and its requirements are not yet fully established. The characteristics a DT model should possess to be widely used in manufacturing remains an open question in the literature. The concept is still broad and dependent on the lifecycle stage and industry sector of application.

The US-developed ""Levels of Development"" (LOD) have become increasingly popular in the Netherlands. However, more and more projects felt the need to develop an additional LOD250 and LDO350. It became clear that the Dutch design-and-engineering process needed different information levels to operate effectively. During an R&D project that involved 9 Dutch SME companies research was done focused on the levels needed in the Dutch AEC industry. During this project, the team also looked at several other information levels - the Danish, the Australian, and the UK RIBA information and the LOD concept in CityGML. The project team came up with 7 information levels. A matrix was developed on which construction objects were linked to the 7 levels. Several companies in different BIM projects tested this matrix in practice. Results from this test were concluded in a guideline for effective use of the information levels and the matrix. This paper will describe the test results and the resulting recommendations for practical use of the standard in the Netherlands. Furthermore, an experiment was conducted to automatically identify the detail of the geometry of an IFC model. This was done by analyzing several characteristics like number of objects per m, and number of geometrical triangles per object. The results of this geometrical test are also added in the paper. © ASCE 2014.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934268813

It will be able to transform a spatial design into a structural design. After structural optimisation, the structural design is interpreted as a spatial design. This spatial design is then modified to comply with the initial design requirements after which a new cycle starts. The transformation and optimisation processes within the toolbox can be altered, allowing automated design studies to be carried out. In this article, two processes for the structural optimisation are investigated to determine which is most suitable for specific conditions. These two processes are: (a) Topology Optimisation applied to complete structural systems for buildings; (b) Evolutionary Structural Optimisation for which only the first step is used. It can be concluded that: (a) although Topology Optimisation is formally more correct, One-Step Evolutionary Structural Optimisation will yield almost the same qualitative results, (b) quantitatively the methods cannot be compared exactly, however, it is likely that Topology Optimisation results in more efficient structures and (c) Topology Optimisation always leads to stable structures, whereas One-Step Evolutionary Structural Optimisation may yield a singular stiffness matrix, although this has no influence on the spatial design derived from the optimised structural design. It is intended to utilise the optimisation techniques in the virtual toolbox leading to design studies and to transcend additional transformation and optimisation processes in the virtual tool box via formal description. Fields of application are the academic study of spatial-structural design processes (i.e. design theory), the optimisation of all possible structural design types (i.e. design optimisation), and the generation of design instances (i.e. generative design). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a concept closely connected with Industry 4.0 that can form a basis for creating a Digital Twin. In this paper, a comprehensive model of a Digital Twin approach for a manufacturing environment and related production processes is proposed. The presented model is based on combining a 5-Dimensional definition for the Digital Twin and cloud-based CPS (C2PS) architecture. The model consists of five layers to replicate the physical object as a virtual object and to collect and convert data. Analysis of the virtual model for prediction of future development, decision-making, re-configuration, what-if analysis, and understanding of the effect of changes in the real time process is performed in the fourth layer. The user interface layer is the connection between the virtual and physical model. Use of a Digital Twin in manufacturing enables improvement in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing, leading to savings in resources such as cost and time. Uncertainties inherent in manufacturing processes mean that the Digital Twin approach is a more suitable method for optimization of the overall process and the sub-processes than pure simulation. An accurate Digital Twin model can improve safety, save costs, speed up manufacturing of new products and implementation of new processes, and provide global optimization results. In practice, however, provision of data is a challenge to use of the Digital Twin approach because modern manufacturing uses a variety of data in different formats with different owners.

Hole cleaning issues can be mitigated by using a digital twinning system that constantly monitors borehole condition with real-time data and process models, and suggests optimal actions. The solution space of possible actions, however, is very large causing computational hurdles for real time implementation. This paper describes a time-efficient digital twinning approach that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate scenarios corresponding to multiple hole cleaning actions. Digital twinning of cuttings transport in a wellbore requires the development of a system with multiple integrated physics and data-based models to quantitatively detect symptoms of impending issues early, and to take actions to mitigate these problems. First, the state of the borehole is quantified in terms of ECD, concentration of cuttings in flow, and cuttings bed height. Next, a solution space of all legal and feasible actions based on the current system state is obtained. Finally, the alternate action sequences are evaluated to suggest the most suitable path forward. To classify the state of the borehole in terms of ECD, cuttings bed height and cuttings concentration in the flow stream, hydraulics and cuttings transport models were implemented, tested and validated against real field and experimental data. Based on the state of the system, allowable actions were evaluated in terms of some combination of hole cleaning parameters that can be controlled in near real-time, such as flow rate, rotary speed, mud density, mud rheology and the weight on bit for rate of penetration (ROP) control. To limit the size of the solution space, those actions that were unrealistic for implementation in real-time were discarded. Also, any actions that violated the limits of the available drilling margin were discarded. Finally, by defining immediate rewards associated with different states-action pairs based on their effect on the wellbore stability and hole condition, the concepts of Markov reward process (MRP) and scenario realizations were used to suggest the optimal action for a given state. The predicted output of the algorithm for multiple operational scenarios was validated by comparing it with actions that a hole cleaning / extended reach drilling (ERD) expert would have taken when given similar scenarios. The automated process of identifying hole cleaning system states, generating multiple viable hole cleaning action sequences, and finally evaluating the probability of successful hole cleaning for multiple actions in real-time and deciding the best course of action, is a novel contribution of this work. It will benefit practitioners who struggle with hole cleaning / stuck pipe-related non-productive time and pave the way for hole cleaning automation. © 2020, IADC/SPE International Drilling Conference and Exhibition",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081659623

In the Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), the currently available current injection-based voltage control for PE converters are not suitable for voltage control in PE dominated systems due to the absence of continuous voltage control and ineffectiveness during islanding. Moreover, in such power systems, the conventional controllers are not suitable for frequency control due to the absence of dynamic frequency control. The paper presents the Direct Voltage Control (DVC) strategy in a real-time environment to mitigate challenges related to voltage and frequency stability during islanding of OWFs. The control strategy is implemented in the average Electro-magnetic Transient (EMT) model of Type-4 Wind Generator (WG) in RSCAD® Version 5.011.1. It is compared with the benchmark model of the control strategy in DIgSILENT PowerFactory™ 2019 SP2 (×64) in EMT platform. The comparison based on shortterm voltage stability and reactive current injection reveals that both the models provide similar results, confirming the validation of the RSCAD model. Moreover, the detailed representation of the converters in the RSCAD model provides a better depiction of the real-world operation. © 2020 by the authors.

A multiphase description of the BEP phenomenon is proposed for the numerical solution at the local scale and validated by means of full-scale experimental results available in the literature. Results of the local scale simulations are used as the training set for a multilayer machine learning (ML) model to bridge the information between the local and system scales. Accuracy of the trained ML algorithms is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from detailed physics-based numerical models. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in its capability of real-time predictions of the overall response at the system scale. A case study is presented where a portion of the Nashville Metro Levee System is analyzed over the span of a year, to assess the likelihood of BEP in the infrastructure. The capability of the model to accept water height data obtained from field measurements is exploited in the numerical simulations. © 2019 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070702943

Automatic semantic translation across information models and standards is an increasingly important problem that needs to be addressed to fulfill these demands in a cost-efficient manner under constraints of human capacity and resources in relation to timing requirements and system complexity. Here we define a translator-based operational interoperability model for interacting cyber-physical systems in mathematical terms, which includes system identification and ontology-based translation as special cases. We present alternative mathematical definitions of the translator learning task and mappings to similar machine learning tasks and solutions based on recent developments in machine learning.

This paper presents an approach that allows data-driven and schedule-oriented supply chain coordination in the face of demand fluctuations. The approach consists of two main steps that contractors should take: 1) monitor the demand fluctuations based on a 4D model that captures the as-built status and updated look-ahead schedules, 2) make decisions to modify original orders to accommodate the demand fluctuations where orders are determined by a heuristic evolutionary algorithm. As a proof of concept, the coordination approach is demonstrated using an example project featuring a five-day in-situ construction of concrete walls. Results from this example show that using the approach improves the responsiveness of concrete planning and ordering. As a result, this leads to improved collaboration between suppliers and contractors in construction projects. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092917257

During these stages, a structured set of data relevant to the operation of the building(s) is constantly updated. These data sets facilitate multiple use cases occurring during the operation phase, e.g. the operation, inspection and maintenance of technical equipment.

Here, rough environments often require robust sensor technologies such as radar, coupled with application-specific software evaluating the measured data. The rising complexity of underlying sensor systems (hard- and software) and complex physical interactions with dynamic environments require development-related validations that use virtual methods primarily focusing on close-to-reality sensor simulation. To allow for a wide range of applications, we propose the use of reusable building blocks that generically model and mimic the physical structure from the real world. This includes the whole path between sensor and 3D environment with respect to sensor-intrinsic characteristics as well as environmental influences such as rain. At the same time, computational scalability of each building block allows physical simulations generating reliable sensor data even in real-time applications. As a result, Digital Twins of relevant components, systems and environments are no longer acting on their own but interacting within Virtual Testbeds allowing for virtual validation of radar-based applications with respect to the operational environment. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099384252

In spite of its edge over conventional drilling, the techniques can be more complex as well. Thus, telemetry system is required to link downhole and surface while-drilling components transmitting and providing useful information under real time condition to the driller during drilling operations for more precise wellbore placement to ensure maximum reservoir exposure, ultimate production increment and monitoring conditions. A novel and systemic decision support system model based on distance-based approach (DBA) has been developed for performance evaluation and optimal selection of while-drilling telemetry systems for potential development of a depleted reservoir field. This aims at deliverable of reliable drilling performance resulting to deliverable of real-Time downhole data collection and most importantly places the matured well with minimal non-productive time during underbalanced drilling operations. This model is solved by effective algorithm integrating objective information as related to influential parameters that AIDS in the appropriate selection of telemetry systems. These parameters help to achieve an optimized underbalanced drilling operation at effective and efficient economic conditions. The scientific value of this study is the development of a simplified user-friendly decision support system for telemetry systems performance evaluation and selection optimization. The proposed framework was been validated and applied to a matured reservoir for an optimum selection of telemetry techniques in underbalanced drilling operation.
