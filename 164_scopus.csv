VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a re-assessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Safety has always been advocated by many construction companies, and they have been working hard to make sure their employees are protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training and evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of technical features and types that could be implemented in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated, while significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and identification, safety training and education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works. It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating the research and practice frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the latest VR/AR applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034043364

In the last decade, major progresses have been made and the AR technology is getting closer to being implemented in industry. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of AR have been explored and quantified in terms of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for industrial maintenance. Unfortunately, some technical issues still prevent AR from being suitable for industrial applications. This paper aims to show, through the results of a systematic literature review, the current state of the art of AR in maintenance and the most relevant technical limitations. The analysis included filtering from a large number of publications to 30 primary studies published between 1997 and 2017. The results indicate a high fragmentation among hardware, software and AR solutions which lead to a high complexity for selecting and developing AR systems.

This research tested the hypotheses that safety training in a virtual reality (VR) construction site would be feasible and more effective, in terms of workers' learning and recall in identifying and assessing construction safety risks, than would equivalent training using conventional methods. Sixty-six subjects were provided training in construction safety and their safety knowledge was tested prior to the training, immediately afterward, and one month later. Half of the subjects received traditional classroom training with visual aids; the other half were trained using a 3D immersive VR power-wall. Significant advantage was found for VR training for stone cladding work and for cast-in-situ concrete work, but not for general site safety. VR training was more effective in terms of maintaining trainees' attention and concentration. Training with VR was more effective over time, especially in the context of cast-in-situ concrete works. Given the need for improved training and the advantages of training using VR, incorporation of VR in construction safety training is strongly recommended. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887108669

AR applications are becoming mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on four technologies - localization, natural user interface (NUI), cloud computing, and mobile devices - which have the potential to influence the development of AR applications. Advances in localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence, cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful, and less expensive.

A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference.

This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management.

Some subjects were presented with photographs and construction documents, while others toured a virtual construction site using a 3-sided virtual reality CAVE. The method allowed both for analysis of differences in perception and assessment between distinct populations and for evaluation of the effectiveness of the virtual environment in demonstrating hazardous situations. Results show that construction superintendents with many years of experience are unable to identify all of the hazards in their work environment, and that there are important discrepancies between the way they assess risk levels and the way most formal safety risk assessment methods rate risk levels. Most subjects in the virtual environment assessed higher risk levels to hazards caused by moving equipment.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels.

Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help improve construction industry performance as well as meet new market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently improve industry performance. On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate 'experiential' learning, which is argued to be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual training context. In order to address the problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without the 'do-or-die' consequences often faced on real construction projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the 'scenes' of the VR environment take place on a construction site, the environment predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers, construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome 'knowledge silos' or 'knowledge compartmentation'. The VR environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by professionals' decisions, faulty work, and health and safety issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow 'things to go wrong' and consequently allows users not only to 'experience' the resulting implications but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the first development phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from industry, the research community, and academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the generalisability of results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially in complex or large-scale models, immersion is one of the major key factors for being able to intuitively perceive all aspects of the scene. A fully immersive system needs to give the user a large field-of-view with reduced latency for lifelike impression. Technologies such as VRwalls and shutter glasses can deliver high refresh rates, yet fail to give a large field-of-view. Head-mounted-devices for virtual reality fill this gap. Head tracking mechanisms translate movements of the user’s head into virtual camera movements and enable a natural way of examining models. Unlike a stereoscopic representation with projectors, point-of-view tracking can be achieved separately for each individual user. Hardware costs for such systems were very high in the past, but have dropped due to virtual reality systems now gaining traction in the mainstream gaming community. Methods: In this paper we present a way to build a low-cost, highly immersive virtual reality environment for engineering and construction applications. Furthermore, we present a method to simplify and partly automate the process of reusing digital building models, which are already used in construction, to create virtual scenes, instead of having to do parallel content creation for visualization. Using the Oculus Rift head-mounted display and the Leap Motion hand-tracking device, we show the possibilities of naturally interacting within a virtual space in different use cases. The software, based on the popular game engine Unreal Engine 4, will be used as a basis for further research and development. Results: Building Information Modeling data can be imported to UE4 with our presented plugin. Using an automated database for mapping materials to the geometry simplifies the process of importing Building Information Modeling entities. The refresh rate of the system stays within acceptable margins needed for virtual reality applications using head-mounted devices. Conclusions: Head-mounted devices present a great potential for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, as a person can experience realistic first-person situations without having to care about injuries. Automated processes for the simplification of content creation, leveraging existing models, and the usage of visual programming languages enable even nonprogrammers to create scenarios to their needs. © 2016, Hilfert and König.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994299770

However, these techniques primarily rely on RF-based location tracking technologies (e.g., GPS or WLAN), which typically do not provide sufficient precision in congested construction sites or require additional hardware and custom mobile devices. Method: This paper presents a new vision-based mobile augmented reality system that allows field personnel to query and access 3D cyber-information on-site by using photographs taken from standard mobile devices. The system does not require any location tracking modules, external hardware attachments, and/or optical fiducial markers for localizing a user’s position. Rather, the user’s location and orientation are purely derived by comparing images from the user’s mobile device to a 3D point cloud model generated from a set of pre-collected site photographs. Results: The experimental results show that 1) the underlying 3D reconstruction module of the system generates complete 3D point cloud models of target scene, and is up to 35 times faster than other state-of-the-art Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms, 2) the localization time takes at most few seconds in actual construction site. Conclusion: The localization speed and empirical accuracy of the system provides the ability to use the system on real-world construction sites.

To narrow this gap, this paper demonstrates the development and utilisation of a training program that is based on virtual reality (VR) simulation. The VR-based safety training program can offer a safe working environment where users can effectively rehearse tasks with electrical hazards and ultimately promote their abilities for electrical hazard cognition and intervention.

Currently, quality management on site is done by site managers through their visual senses. However, it is often challenging for a handful of site managers to perform quality management efficiently for an entire site based on inspected progress of construction works. As a consequence, inspections are often omitted, resulting in faulty construction and quality degradation which may necessitate rework. This may adversely affect project costs and schedule. This paper addresses these issues by utilizing BIM, image-matching, and augmented reality (AR) to develop two types of defect management systems including: 1) an image-matching system to enable quality inspection without visiting the real work site; and 2) a mobile DM-AR app which enables workers and managers to automatically detect dimension errors and omissions on the jobsite. The two systems are tested and evaluated by lab and site experiments for reinforcement concrete (RC) work to assess the benefits and limitations. Experimental results demonstrate the defect management system's effectiveness in automatic omission and error detection at real job sites. The study emphasizes the potential applicability of BIM, image-matching, and AR technologies that could be utilized to improve construction defect management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a vision-based hazard avoidance system that proactively informs workers of potentially dangerous situations. The system enables workers to recognize and consequently avoid dangers before accidents occur by displaying augmented hazard information on a wearable device. The system comprises of three modules; a vision-based site monitoring module that utilizes image capture device and wearable devices to identify site hazards, a safety assessment module that uses captured image data and fuzzy-based reasoning to evaluate the safety level of each object, and a visualization module that provides actionable information such as hazard orientation, distance, and safety level.

This relies mainly on the visualization of a BIM model, which can appear on different mediums. Visualization on mediums such as computer screens, lack some degrees of immersion which may prevent the full utilization of the model. Another problem with conventional collaboration methods such as BIM-Big room, is the need of physical presence of participants in a room. Virtual Reality as the most immersive medium for visualizing a model, has the promise to become a regular part of construction industry. The virtual presence of collaborators in a VR environment, eliminates the need of their physical presence. Simulation of on-site task can address a number of issues during construction, such as feasibility of operations. As consumer VR tools have recently been available in the market, little research has been done on their actual employment in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) practices. Case description: This paper investigates the application of a VR based workflow in a real project. The authors collaborated with a software company to evaluate some of their advanced VR software features, such as simulation of an on-site task. A case study of VR integrated collaboration workflow serves as an example of how firms can overcome the challenge of benefiting this new technology. A group of AEC professionals involved in a project were invited to take part in the experiment, utilizing their actual project BIM models. Discussion and evaluation: The results of the feedbacks from the experiment confirmed the supposed benefits of a VR collaboration method. Although the participants of the study were from a wide range of disciplines, they could find benefits of the technology in their practice. It also resulted that an experimental method of clash detection via simulation, could actually be practical. Conclusion: The simulation of on-site tasks and perception of architectural spaces in a 1:1 scale are assets unique to VR application in AEC practices. Nevertheless, the study shows the investment in new hardware and software, and resistant against adoption of new technologies are main obstacles of its wide adoption.

These applications are built upon Virtual Environments (VEs) in which artificial agents act autonomously while interacting in realtime with users. Semantic modelling of a VR environment makes it possible the knowledge-driven access from the description of VEs that simplifies the development of VR applications. It eases the development of these types of applications. Semantic modelling should provide a consistent representation of the following aspects: 1) The simulated world, its structure and the behavior of its entities, 2) Interactions and tasks, that users and agents can perform in the environment, 3) Knowledge items, that autonomous agents can use for decision-making or for communication with users. This paper presents MASCARET, a model-based approach, for the design of semantic VR environments. This approach is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In this approach, UML is used to provide a knowledge-driven access to the semantic contents of the VE and not for code generation, as in classical software development process. Interests of a UML-based approach are that its metamodel covers different views of the semantic modelling: ontology, structure, behaviors, interactions, activities. It is also an extensible language that can be specialized to provide formal operational semantics.

However, safety topics are not given adequate attention in most construction curricula and traditional pedagogic tools fail to provide practical experience or sufficiently engage students in acquiring safety knowledge. With this regard, this study proposes the VIrtual FIeld Trip System (VIFITS) for mobile construction safety education using a 360-degree panoramic virtual reality. The VIFITS utilizes a state-of-the-art 360-degree panorama-based Virtual Reality technology in order to bring construction field trips to the classroom and provide practical experience to improve students’ safety knowledge. VIFITS consists of three modules: (1) a Safety Information Dissemination module (SID) in which the educator disseminates safety information to the students through mobile learning; (2) a Virtual Field Trip Experience module (FTE) where students experience virtual construction field trips based on their own mobile devices; (3) and a Safety Knowledge Assessment module (SKA) designed for learners to play testing simulation games in order to assess their safety knowledge. The VIFITS prototype is developed and validated with virtual scenarios derived from real construction sites. The results reveal that the VIFITS is a powerful pedagogical method for effectively providing practical experience and safety knowledge for students. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049388920

The purposes are to improve the control and monitor of construction projects and to find the optimized solutions for construction processes. The authors have implemented a Building Information Model (BIM) and used it in a VR world. The details of the BIM model are the basis for the optimization analysis in construction. Using VR technology in the analysis helps the architect, engineer, and contractor (A/E/C) team to understand construction projects and plans. The team can gain experience by developing and critiquing construction sequences in a full-scale virtual environment. The team can also gain interactive operation, simulation, and optimization experiences. VR simulations in construction should not only focus on the pre-construction stage, but also record the site changes and update the system in real time. The real-time VR simulation in this study can be used throughout the entire construction process. In particular, the technology will help in the optimization of steel installation sequencing during construction. The real-time VR simulation is done via the use of RFID and its related database. In this study, the authors are experimenting with the use of a data hub for staging and cleansing the data before feeding it into the BIM database. This BIM/RFID enriched VR environment improves the straight forward representations which VR simulation can provide, automates construction data collection by acquiring RFID in real time, and accomplishes data integration through the use of BIM.

The authors employed augmented reality technologies to connect the BIM Table and the mobile devices as well as the public and private information.

This digital information model allows simulating the real energy behavior of the building and the improvement in the building’s lighting systems, both natural and artificial, in particular daylighting. In this way, the BIM 6D simulation allows us to make design and operation decisions for the building, not only for new buildings that must be, in accordance with current legislation, NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Building) but also for the rehabilitation of existing buildings. Particularly in buildings for sanitary use, BIM 6D allows an exhaustive analysis of the energy impact of said rehabilitation, guiding it towards an improvement in energy and light efficiency, which in turn provides greater quality and comfort in the use of the sustainable building. This subject of study is especially important in public buildings for hospital use. Buildings where energy efficiency and comfort, oriented towards optimal and efficient lighting, are two fundamental criteria highly appreciated by patients and citizens in general. Once the energy model of the building has been obtained, it is possible to study and identify possible alternatives to improve energy efficiency and improve lighting, as well as to analyze the possibilities of incorporating other more efficient forms of renewable energy, such as the use of daylight. In this work we can see how applying a set of simulated improvement actions in BIM 6D achieves an energy saving of 50% in general and up to 13% only by acting on lighting systems, allowing the decarbonization of buildings with high energy consumption, such as hospitals, and in turn, will lead to an improvement in the energy certification of these buildings; thus achieving a better and higher quality of habitability, using more efficient forms of lighting and transforming buildings into more sustainable spaces. © 2020 by the authors.

Consequently, the Architecture Engineering Construction and Operations sector is pursuing digitalization to improve project management, assist trade-crews and achieve a more efficient working environment. As a result, the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approaches towards a collaborative and integrated working process. Although BIM is improving the aforementioned problems, not all corporations are able to implement and use it effectively. As such, supportive tools to assist BIM in achieving its full potential are in high demand. To facilitate the deployment and application of BIM, easy-entry technologies such as Virtual Reality tools are establishing themselves as a promising addition to BIM methodology.

Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their 'control', the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders' perceptions - that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews - within the construction domain - state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document 'high risk' defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data.

Certainly, one of the goals of designers during the review process is to ensure the design solutions are well understood. Recently, virtual reality (VR) systems have been adopted in an effort to improve this shared understanding of ongoing designs. However, the effectiveness and suitability of such systems to design review practices has not been rigorously tested yet. In this context, this paper describes a systematic usability study consisting of a mix of empirical and inspection-based methods (user testing and heuristics evaluation) that aimed to investigate the implications and usability issues from the adoption of an immersive virtual reality system in design review. The usability testing comprised the evaluation of three main aspects from the user standpoint: Users' cognitive performance, users' interaction performance, and the system suitability to design review practices. The experiment consisted of expert designers performing tasks within the virtual environment and then responding to objective and subjective questions about their understanding of the virtual representation, their overall experience using the platform, and their personal assessment on heuristics regarding the system's user interface. The usability evaluation provided evidence that the immersive virtual reality system is indeed efficient in communicating design solutions, which could improve communication quality during design review meetings. However, the heuristics evaluation (alone) revealed that the system has significant usability flaws and still requires improvements in its user interface. Nevertheless, since issues were rated as ""minor usability problems,"" improvements to the system are very likely. In light of the evaluation findings, the last part of this article discusses the extent to which the immersive virtual reality system could benefit the decision-making in design review, and provides some insights on potential improvements. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

A prerequisite of contextual information display is the localization of objects and the device in the real world. In this paper, we present our approach to the problem of mobile indoor localization with a given building model. The approach does not use external sensors or input. Accurate external sensors such as stationary cameras may be expensive and difficult to set up and maintain. Relying on already existing external sources may also prove to be difficult, as especially inside buildings, Internet connections can be unreliable and GPS signals can be inaccurate. Therefore, we try to find a localization solution for augmented reality devices that can accurately localize itself only with data from internal sensors and preexisting information about the building. If a building has an accurate model of its geometry, we can use modern spatial mapping techniques and point-cloud matching to find a mapping between local device coordinates and global model coordinates. We use normal analysis and 2D template matching on an inverse distance map to determine this mapping.

Virtual reality (VR) provides an alternative to create immersive working environments without significant safety concerns. Working on elevated surfaces is a dangerous scenario, which may lead to gait and postural instability and, consequently, a serious fall. Previous studies showed that VR is a promising tool for measuring the impact of height on the postural sway. However, most of these studies used the treadmill as the walking locomotion apparatus in a virtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on natural walking locomotion to reduce the inherent postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate the impact of virtual height on gait characteristics and keep the level of realism and feeling of presence at their highest, we enhanced the first-person-character model with ‘virtual legs’. Afterward, we investigated its effect on the gait parameters of the participants with and without the presence of height. To that end, twelve healthy adults were asked to walk on a virtual loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th floor of an unfinished structure. By quantitatively comparing the participants’ gait pattern results, we observed a decrease in the stride length and increase in the gait duration of the participants exposed to height. At the ground level the use of enhanced model reduced participants’ average stride length and height. In other words, in the presence of VR legs, the level of realism significantly increases and thus results in a better virtual gait simulation. The results of this study help us understand users’ behaviors when they were exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm ground for gait stability analysis for the future height-related VR studies. We expect this developed VR platform can generate reliable results of VR application in more construction safety studies. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

The results of experiments in which groups of participants discussed and chose optimal design options indicated that there is no large statistical difference in IVR-based and FtF communication in terms of discussion quality (level of effectiveness and satisfaction experienced), communication richness (detailed responses and vivid messages), and openness (enjoyableness and open-mindedness) during the communication. However, for the accuracy of communication (information communicated correctly and understood properly), FtF communication was better than IVR-based communication, which is assumed due to weak human-human to interaction in IVR. In addition, the communication appropriateness (behavioral acts such as politeness or social norms), IVR-based communication was significantly less than FtF communication, indicating that communicating with others only seeing virtual avatar could make it difficult to discern participant’ reactions or identify appropriate moments to speak.

This paper identifies and discusses the various challenges of applying AR in the underground utility construction industry through a review of over 500 publications from 2006 to present and a Meta-analysis of the data. The challenges and barriers are categorized into: (1) data collection issues; (2) modeling alignment barriers; (3) hardware limitations; and (4) data storing and managing challenges. The main associated issues are discussed and further recommendations to overcome these challenges are presented. This paper provides a contribution by showing underground project stakeholders the barriers to overcome in applying AR. The main motivation of this research is to make the construction industry aware of the benefits of leveraging AR to prevent utility strikes, while enhancing productivity. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

The nature of interaction between the physical world and the virtual-world has changed forever. Fortunately for the AECO industry, the transition from traditional Computer Aided Design to virtual building design phrased as Building Information Modeling has created a tremendous potential to adopt Augmented Reality. The presented research is situated in the early design stage of project inception and focuses on supporting informed collective decision-making, characterized by a dynamic back and forth analytical process generating large amounts of data. Facilitation aspects, such as data-collection, storage and access to enable comparability and evaluation are crucial for collective decision-making. The current research has addressed these aspects by means of data accessibility, visualization and presentation. At the core of the project is a custom developed Augmented Reality framework that enables data interaction within the design model. In order to serve as a collaborative decision support engine, the framework also allows multiple models and their datasets to be displayed and exercised simultaneously.

However, a similar three-dimensional approach for the visualisation of the current state of the construction works is lacking. Currently, progress reports typically include numerous pictures of the construction site or elements, alongside the appropriate parts of the 3D as-design BIM model. If a proper transition to a 3D design versus 3D current state were achieved, the evolved type of reports would become more comprehensible, resulting in more well-informed decision-making. This requires a single, unique software platform that is able to import, process, analyse and visualise both the as-design BIM model as well as the recorded data of the current construction state. At present however, the visualisation and interpretation of the different datasets alone requires already multiple software packages. As a partial solution this work presents a platform to easily visualise and interpret various data sources such as point clouds, meshes and BIM models and analysis results. Recent advances of gaming engines focus on and allow for an excellent visualisation of mesh data. Therefore all of the aforementioned data sources are converted into mesh objects upon importing. Moreover, gaming engines provide the necessary tools to traverse the scene intuitively allowing construction site managers and other stakeholders to gain a more complete and better oversight of the construction project. Furthermore, these engines also provide the possibility to take the immersion to the next level: Incorporating the 3D entities into a Virtual Reality (VR) environment makes the visualised data and the executed analyses even more comprehensible. By means of a case study, the potential of the presented approach is showcased.

Because of the increasing complexity of the present-day building projects, FM activities, for example, maintaining a building facility or a system, normally involve enormous human multitasking across different knowledge domains. Lessons learned from the present successful FM instances manifest that the FM teams are increasingly interested in applying more viable technologies to achieve the effective management of massive information. Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology is one of the promising approaches, as it forms a platform for the users to manage the information of a facility and leverages virtual digital representations as a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle. Nevertheless, the fully immersive environments produced by BIM still lack the capability of mapping a virtual world into a real world, or vice versa. Augmented Reality (AR) is emerging as an advanced visualization which is possible to bridge the gap. It enables the demonstration of BIM context into the real world, and is envisaged to effectively improve the way of how information is displayed. Meanwhile, the virtuality-toreality changeover from BIM to AR is conductive to a better understanding of information about a facility from the human perception perspective. The objective of the study is to explore that the merging of AR with BIM is a way for improving the information search and management in FM applications.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of VR models for promoting learners engagement in construction studies. We created a virtual reality model of sustainable building features (earth building techniques, rainwater harvesting tank, dry toilet, solar panels, and green wall) to stimulate sustainability in construction studies.

Further, 71.5% of learners involved in this project believed that VR models are useful in construction studies due to their convenience and easy access and found it an asset to their learning.

The potential of BIM methodology to support a transformation of the processes of design and construction has been evident in the construction industry. A current topic that requires attention is the integration of BIM with Virtual Reality (VR) where the user visualizes a virtual world through interactive devices or a total immersion. VR combines several devices for interaction, creating virtual environment, and this must followed by studies concerning how to use devices or how to establish links for the presentation of information contained in a BIM model. By adding VR, the BIM solution can address retrieving and presenting information and increasing efficiency on communication and problem solving in an interactive and collaborative project. BIM + VR allow two main capacities: walkthrough and consulting data, and currently BIM tools allow links to VR plugins in order to achieve both capacities. As such, it is expected to be further explored in the near future. The text presents a review of actual perspective of the VR use applied over 3D/BIM models to supports multi-dimensional BIM applications, namely, 4D/BIM and 7D/BIM models. The objective of the study is to report the improvement of BIM uses with the addition of interactive capacities allowed by VR technology.

BIM allows nD information to be visualized simultaneously by architects, engineers and constructors to gain a synchronized understanding viewing from different perspectives. However, BIM is conventionally being operated on a desktop-based computer which makes collaboration less flexible, and it also creates an isolation gap between the model and reality. This isolation gap does not severely affect experienced and skilled professionals, as they can bridge the isolation gap with their intuition developed over the years. Nevertheless, users who are lack of such experience will feel the isolation gap between the digital realm and practicable reality, which could be the hurdle in project participation and decision making. AR allows virtual content to be mixed with real environment for user experience. In the context of our study, AR is functional to present the nD information of BIM, at the same time retaining users' connection with the reality. It is not just being utilized solely for presentation, but also to maximize the potential for communication, interaction and experience. This pilot study investigates effective technological approach of using AR as an effective collaboration technology combining with BIM through proposed key aspects of contextualization, customization and curation. Contextualization is significant to enable users to understand the AR content by making the presented information meaningful to the target audience, implemented thru the means of 2D annotations, animations and options comparison. This study compares both AR BIM with and without contextualization. Customization can generate unique virtual environment and content for different level of users tailored to their needs and preference to create intuitive interaction with AR BIM. Curation is crucial to provide users with a reliable experience, and to formulate a continually improving AR BIM thru log data and users' feedback. All in all, this paper explores the major aspects of contextualization, customization and curation, to distinguish effective approach in the currently 'free for all' AR BIM development. Finally, an implication is provided for future study in terms of balance in information sufficiency and complexity for AR BIM. © 2016 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016005025

Unfortunately, in most cases construction students are not exposed enough to realistic construction project experience during their time at today's universities, leaving them with a preparation that does not fully realize their capability to face the challenges of real-world project management. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of a pilot project that was carried out in order to address this problem. The project involved designing and creating an interactive learning experience within the Second Life virtual reality environment that gives construction students a realistic experience with construction event sequences and resource management. This project merged the use of virtual reality environments to simulate real-life construction projects with the perspective of using gaming tools as genuine means of education in the university setting. Once a playable interactive learning experience was completed it was tested with the help of a small sample of construction students. Due to the visual interactivity and gaming style, it was hypothesized that the use of a virtual reality environment such as Second Life to design and create an interactive learning experience would prove to be very useful for construction students to learn about and gain experiences in project scheduling. In support of this hypothesis, it was predicted that the results of the experiment would show that the construction students who participated did in fact learn something and gained construction experience from their time using the interactive learning experience. While the technical questions were inconclusive regarding whether or not the students learned anything, the opinion questions showed a very positive outlook. The participants, who each reported that they gained most of their construction experience from onsite work, unanimously agreed that they gained realistic construction project experience from their time using the interactive learning experience and would be interested in using virtual reality environments in the future. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029119492

This information was included in a data base that supports the periodic inspection needed in a program of preventive maintenance. The results are obtained interactively and visualized in the virtual environment itself. A second prototype based on VR technology with application to construction planning, was implemented.

Sustainable building design and optimization is a highly iterative and complicated process. This is mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different heterogenous but heuristic construction processes, building systems and workflows involved in achieving this goal. Augmented Reality (AR) has rapidly emerged as a revolutionary technology that could play a key role towards improving coordination of sustainable design processes. AR makes possible the real-time visualization of a three-dimensional (3D) building prototype with linked design information in a real-world environment based on a two-dimensional drawing. From past research, it is evident that this technology relies heavily on a common data environment (CDE) that syncs all construction processes with their related building information in one central model. However, due to the fragmented nature of the construction industry, different domain experts generate and exchange vast amounts of heterogenous information using different software tools outside a CDE. This paper therefore investigates the performance gap that exists within Malaysia’s construction industry towards using linked building data (LBD) with AR to improve the lifecycle sustainability of buildings. The results of this study clearly delineate how current construction practices in Malaysia do not favor the use of AR however, stakeholder perception is positive towards adoption of workflows that link heterogenous building data to streamline AR with sustainable building design and construction. ©BEIESP.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071372893

The major causation of the accidents in this industry is fall from height. In developing countries such as Thailand, there are too many unsafe conditions in construction activities performed at high elevation. Although, the government enforces safety rules and regulations, safety facilities are still provided inadequately. The involved parties such as construction engineers and supervisors do not pay much attention to unsafe conditions, which may be caused by ignorance and unawareness of those personnel regarding hazards and risks. To eliminate unsafe conditions and to reduce a number of accidents, in-charge personnel should definitely have knowledge related with the requirements of safety procedures and safety facilities of construction activities performed at high elevation. It is more effective to enable those personnel gain experiences and perceive inherent hazards and risks of those activities in the actual construction environment. Thus, an innovative approach is needed to provide the personnel with visualized information of those activities as they occur in real construction site. This study aims to develop a visualized approach for simulating the construction activities operated at high elevation using Augmented Reality to educate construction personnel. The improvement of construction personnel considerations in safety planning is investigated. The proposed system consists of the following: (1) hardware components, including a laptop computer, a video camera, and a head-mounted display (HMD), (2) three databases, i.e., database of virtual model of construction objects, database of hazards, risks, and consequences, and database of safe and unsafe scenarios, and (3) a computer program for generating and superimposing the simulations into the real world scene. This research is on-going and the prototype systems are under development. The prototype will be tested at a real construction site.
