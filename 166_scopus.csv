To facilitate existing-structure data acquisition for the as-built BIM, a terrestrial laser scanner, which is fast, simple to use, and yet highly accurate, is widely employed. However, as-built BIM creation of building interiors using scanned point clouds incurs critical difficulties: the complex design of indoor structures, not to mention obstacles, necessitates time-consuming manual operation and resultantly huge data sizes, which often leads to system slow-down or failure. To manage this problem, most of the recent and current research has looked to full automation; yet facility management personnel still rely on traditional field measurements because their qualitative results can only be obtained under ideal conditions or with some errors. Alternatively, in this paper, a more practical semi-automatic methodology for improved productivity of as-built BIM creation with respect to large and complex indoor environments is proposed. The proposed approach produces three-dimensional (3D) geometric drawings through three steps: segmentation for plane extraction, refinement for removal of noisy points, and boundary tracing for outline extraction. The experimental results for two test sites, a relatively simple corridor and a complex atrium, showed a high data-size reduction rate: to 3.8 and 4.3% of the original sizes, out of 51.5 and 111.5 million points, respectively. Based on the automatically produced geometric drawings and the remaining points, manual as-built BIM creation was conducted. Using the extracted lines as guides, each object and its relationship were more easily identified and modeled. At the same time, the great reduction in the point clouds' data sizes enabled the modeler, using the BIM software, to efficiently manipulate the geometric drawing without system slow-down or failure. The proposed approach was shown to be a potentially effective means of improving productivity and reliability in complex indoor as-built BIM production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896541031

Despite the growing use of Building Information Modelling and the improvement in as-built records, several more years will be required before guidelines that require as-built data modelling will be implemented for the majority of constructed facilities, and this will still not address the stock of existing buildings. A technical solution for scanning buildings and compiling Building Information Models is needed. However, this is a multidisciplinary problem, requiring expertise in scanning, computer vision and videogrammetry, machine learning, and parametric object modelling. This paper outlines the technical approach proposed by a consortium of researchers that has gathered to tackle the ambitious goal of automating as-built modelling as far as possible.

The procedure conceives of the point cloud as a stacking of point sections. The complexity of the clouds is arbitrary, since the procedure is designed for terrestrial laser scanner surveys applied to buildings with irregular geometry, such as historical buildings. The procedure aims at solving the problems connected to the generation of finite element models of these complex structures by constructing a fine discretized geometry with a reduced amount of time and ready to be used with structural analysis. If the starting clouds represent the inner and outer surfaces of the structure, the resulting finite element model will accurately capture the whole three-dimensional structure, producing a complex solid made by voxel elements.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902439119

Thus, the construction industry has been using point cloud data for a variety of purposes including 3D model reconstruction, geometry quality inspection, construction progress tracking, etc. Although a number of studies have been reported on applying point cloud data for the construction industry in the recent decades, there has not been any systematic review that summaries these applications and points out the research gaps and future research directions. This paper, therefore, aims to provide a thorough review on the applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry and to provide recommendations on future research directions in this area. A total of 197 research papers were collected in this study through a two-fold literature search, which were published within a fifteen-year period from 2004 to 2018.

Following the literature review, this paper discusses on the acquisition and processing of point cloud data, particularly focusing on how to properly perform data acquisition and processing to fulfill the needs of the intended construction applications. Specifically, the determination of required point cloud data quality and the determination of data acquisition parameters are discussed with regard to data acquisition, and the extraction and utilization of semantic information and the platforms for data visualization and processing are discussed with regard to data processing.

Millions of accurate 3D points (mm level accuracy) can be delivered by this technique with a high point density in a short time (up to 1 million points per second), which makes it a potential technique for large scale applications in engineering environments such as tunnels, bridges, and heritage buildings. Tunnels, in particular those with long lengths, create great challenges for surveyors to obtain the satisfactory scanned data. This paper presents a short history of TLS techniques used for tunnels. A general overview of TLS techniques is given, followed by a review of several applications of TLS for tunnels. These applications are classified as: detecting geological features of drilling tunnels, monitoring the geometry of tunnels during excavation, making deformation measurements, and extracting features. The review emphasizes how TLS techniques can be used to measure various aspects of tunnels.

To deal with a large variety of project data and information to support efficient and effective decision making, visualization, information modeling, and simulation (VIMS) has become critical in the development of capital facilities and infrastructures. The objective of this paper is to identify and investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges, examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future research. These research directions apply to technical issues and sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place, which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry. By incorporating the whole project lifecycle, not only project execution but also planning, operation, and maintenance, the analysis provides meaningful hints for VIMS challenges in architecture, engineering, and facility management industries. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992220783

A personal laser scanning (PLS) device combined with SLAM technology provides an effective solution for forest inventory under complex conditions with its light weight and flexible mobility. This study proposes a new method for calculating the volume of a cylinder using point cloud data obtained by a PLS device by fitting to a polygonal cylinder to calculate the diameter of the trunk. The point cloud data of tree trunks of different thickness were modeled using different fitting methods. The rate of correct tree trunk detection was 93.3% and the total deviation of the estimations of tree diameter at breast height (DBH) was -1.26 cm. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the estimations of the extracted DBH and the tree position were 1.58 cm and 26 cm, respectively. The survey efficiency of the personal laser scanning (PLS) device was 30m 2 /min for each investigator, compared with 0.91m 2 /min for the field survey.

Although many research efforts have been made on automatic point cloud registration, prior works have some limitations. Automatic registration was tested in a bounded region and required a large overlapped area between scans. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel method that achieves automatic point cloud registration in an unbounded region and with a relatively small overlapped area without using artificial targets, landmarks, or any other manual alignment process. For automatic point cloud registration, the proposed framework uses the feature detection algorithms commonly used in computer vision to identify geometric correspondences among the series of scans for the initial alignment. Then, it computes the overlapped area between scans and determines a method to use for the final alignment. If the overlapped area is sufficiently large, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to generate the proper transformation. Otherwise, a plane-matching algorithm is used to achieve precise registration. The proposed framework was tested at outdoor construction sites and an indoor environment, which resulted in deviation angle accuracy of less than 0.35° for outdoor and 0.13° for indoor testbeds, respectively, with processing time of less than 4 min. These promising results demonstrate that the proposed target-free automatic registration method can significantly reduce the manual registration time and data gathering time without compromising the registration accuracy, thus simplifying and promoting laser scanning practices in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management (AEC/FM) industry. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035357617

Current practice for the formwork and rebar DQA of RC elements relies on measurement-tape based manual inspection by qualified personnel, which is labor intensive and time consuming. In addition, the current practice for the inspection often involve the case that field inspectors need to walk onto rebar cages for close assessments, leading to potential safety hazard and damage the integrity of the structure. In order to tackle these limitations of the current practice and research, this study aims to develop a laser scanning-based technique that automatically assesses the key DQA checklists of RC element including rebar spacing and concrete cover with respect to the formwork. To this end, a noise removal algorithm is developed based on the known geometric configuration of formwork and rebar to remove background noise and mixed pixels. Key features of the formwork and rebar are then automatically extracted using the principal component analysis and the RANSAC. The experimental results show that the rebar spacing, the formwork dimension, the concrete cover and the side cover of the tested specimen are estimated with discrepancies of 2.15 mm, 2.52 mm, 2.18 mm and 3.12 mm on average, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed technique can provide accurate solution for the formwork and rebar DQA during the fabrication stage before pouring concrete. In addition, the lessons learned from the results of the laboratory test including the issues of scan density, formwork material are comprehensively discussed, which will be useful for practitioners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077753750

In most cases, the properties of digital artefacts (e.g. readability, coverage) are affected by the acquisition procedure (e.g. device, workflow, conditions) and the characteristics of the physical artefact (e.g. shape, size and materials). In this paper, we study how to combine two acquisition techniques to acquire detailed 3D models of large physical objects. Specifically, we combine two laser scanning instruments: terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structured light scanner (SLS). TLS provides millimeter-scale resolution with large field of view, while SLS provides sub-millimeter resolution for limited field of view. This paper focuses on the registration of SLS and TLS point clouds, a critical step, which aims at aligning the acquired point clouds in a common frame. Existing registration systems mostly rely on manual post-processing or marker-based alignment. Manual registration is however time consuming and tedious, while markers increase the complexity of scanning and are not always acceptable in cultural site documentation. Therefore, we propose an automated markerless registration and fusion pipeline for point clouds. Firstly, we replace the marker-based coarse alignment by an automated registration of SLS and TLS point clouds; secondly, we refine the alignment of SLS point clouds on TLS data using the Iterative Corresponding Point algorithm; finally, we seamless stitch the SLS and TLS point clouds by globally regularizing the registration error for the all the point clouds at once. Our experiments show the efficiency of the proposed approach on two real-world cases, involving detailed point clouds correctly aligned without requiring markers or manual tuning.

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is able to collect dense three-dimensional point data from the survey scene and achieve highly accurate measurements; therefore, it is considered to be one of the most promising surveying techniques for railway track geometry deformation monitoring. This paper proposes a new approach that uses TLS to detect subsidence and irregularities in a track by fitting boundaries of the cross section of the track. In addition, for a section of local railway, an outdoor experiment was performed to ascertain the feasibility and accuracy of this method. The deformations detected with TLS were compared with the field measurements gathered with other methods such as those from a track inspection car.

The movements underlying these tasks largely determine performance success, which motivates the need for a noninvasive and portable means for movement quantification. We answer this need by exploiting body-worn and rifle-mounted miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs) for measuring torso and rifle motions during updown and aiming tasks. The IMUs incorporate MEMS accelerometers and angular rate gyros that measure translational acceleration and angular velocity, respectively. Both sensors enable independent estimates of the orientation of the IMU and thus, the orientation of a subject's torso and rifle. Herein, we establish the accuracy of a complementary filter which fuses these estimates for tracking torso and rifle orientation by comparing IMU-derived and motion capture-derived (MOCAP) torso pitch angles and rifle elevation and azimuthal angles during four up-down and rifle aiming trials for each of 16 subjects (64 trials total). The up-down trials consist of five maximal effort get-down-get-up cycles (from standing to lying prone back to standing), while the rifle aiming trials consist of rapidly aiming five times at two targets 15 feet from the subject and 180 degrees apart. Results reveal that this filtering technique yields warfighter torso pitch angles that remain within 0.55 degrees of MOCAP estimates and rifle elevation and azimuthal angles that remain within 0.44 and 1.26 degrees on average, respectively, for the 64 trials analyzed. We further examine potential remaining error sources and limitations of this filtering approach. These promising results point to the future use of this technology for quantifying motion in naturalistic environments. Their use may be extended to other applications (e.g., sports training and remote health monitoring) where noninvasive, inexpensive, and accurate methods for reliable orientation estimation are similarly desired.

The comparison of as-planned schedules against the as-built status of construction enables the involved parties to determine project performance. Periodic monitoring of project performance enables timely identification of discrepancies between the schedule baseline and the project schedule. The rapid identification of discrepancies allows necessary measures to be taken to minimize the impact of a delay on the construction workflow. In transportation projects, the traditional means of acquiring as-built data from a construction site prevents involved parties from receiving the required information from the site in a timely manner. The delay in the communication of information ultimately causes subsequent delays in implementing necessary courses of action targeted toward improving the workflow. Therefore, this project develops a technology-supplemented progress monitoring approach. The approach implements as-built data with a high level of detail is obtained from a jobsite within a reasonable period of time using lidar technology while ensuring the safety of the data collector. The proposed framework utilizes point cloud data obtained using mobile lidar technology and 4D design models to identify deviations of the performed work from the planned work.

The differences between these two POC values for every element, on a particular scan date, are used for assessing the performance of the proposed framework. The obtained POC difference values ranged from −7% to 6% for most elements, which shows that the developed framework enables tracking the completion of individual bridge elements in an accurate and efficient manner. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073708812

However, the GPS-only solution can't provide continuous and accurate position information in the unfavourable environments, such as urban canyons, indoor buildings, dense foliages due to signal blockage, interference, or jamming etc. A pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system integrating the self-contained inertial sensors with GPS receiver is proposed to provide a seamless outdoor/indoor 3D pedestrian navigation. The MEM sensor module attached to the user's waist is composed of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis digital compass and a barometric pressure sensor, which doesn't rely on any infrastructure. The positioning algorithm implements a loosely coupled GPS/PDR integration. The sensor data are fused via a complementary filter to reduce the integral drift and magnetic disturbance for accurate heading. The four key components of the PDR algorithm: step detection, stride length estimation, heading and position determination are described in detail and implemented by the microcontroller. The step is detected using the accelerometer signals by the combination of three approaches: sliding window, peak detection and zero-crossing. The step length is estimated using a simple linear relationship with the step frequency. By coupling the step length, azimuth and height, 3D navigation is achieved. The performance of the proposed system is carefully verified through several field outdoor and indoor walking tests. The positioning errors are below 3% of the total traveled distance. The main error source comes from the orientation estimation.

Laser-scanning 3D profile data provide a new way of road-marking detection and measurement with an elevation accuracy of about 0.25 mm. This paper presents an automatic road-marking detection and measurement method that uses laser scanning of 3D pavement data. The elevation characteristics and geometric statistics that characterize road markings have been fully analyzed using 3D data. The first step was to use a specially designed step-shaped operator to convolve profile data to identify the regions of suspected marking edges at the profile level, which helps reduce the influence of other pavement factors, including crosswise-slope information, cracks, and rutting. Next, by combining the geometric characteristics of the road-marking region and the continuity of the convolution features at image level, the regions of suspected 3D road markings were extracted. Third, a convolutional neural network was introduced to distinguish real-marking data more clearly. Finally, the three-dimension measurement information was extracted from the detected region and from elevation information. Road-marking recognition experiments were then conducted based on real measured 3D data. The detection accuracies were all greater than 90.8% for 4178 test samples from five road sections with different kinds of road markings. Furthermore, the repeatability of multiple measurement results for road-marking elevations from two selected road sections was about 95%, and the correlation of the obtained road-marking elevations with manually measured elevations was about 85.36% for 200 measurement points. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073054183

If the available sight distance on a roadway is limited, this reduces the ability of drivers to safely carry out certain maneuvers such as stopping or passing. Obstructions to sight distance are often caused by a range of different factors. This includes roadside vegetation overgrowing into the road's right of way and obstructions related to the road's alignment. To ensure that sufficient sight distance is available throughout a road's service life, transportation agencies are required to conduct regular long site visits to identify the existence of any obstructions while identifying the types of those obstructions. Although many studies have attempted quantifying available sight distance in the past, not much work has been done to automatically identify and study the types of obstructions causing sight distance limitations. This information is critical to entities looking to decide on the appropriate construction activity required to alleviate sight distance limitations. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a fully automated novel method to assess sight distance on highways scanned using mobile LiDAR technology, while also proposing a method for the automated classification of the type of obstruction detected.

The proposal provides an explorative way of approaching the numerous possibilities that arise in civil engineering when it comes to IoT, automation, monitoring, and control of civil engineering processes. The used tools represent accessible and affordable ways for application in classrooms and in educational laboratories for beginners. The initial explorative approach implies the fusion of three realms: (i) the phenomenology and mathematics of varied civil engineering problems; (ii) the systematic use of digital fabrication technologies and electronic prototyping platforms; and (iii) the creative and visual way of developing codes provided by block-based development platforms. This integration of perspectives is an attempt of approaching civil engineering mathematics to technology and arts with a rigorous scientific approach.

An approach is presented herein for creating geometric agency within BIMs by exploiting their parametric capabilities, the accuracy of 3D point clouds, and the dexterity of metaheuristics. The result is a dynamic BIM (“dyna-BIM”) capable of updating its geometry to match a 3D point cloud. A case study for cast-in-place concrete footings shows how the average error between a BIM and the as-built conditions can be reduced from 50.4 mm to 5.69 mm.

The contribution of this article is the development of a framework for deploying and comparing three distinct gDT approaches for use during fabrication and assembly in OSM: (1) a scan-vs-BIM approach, (2) a scan-to-BIM approach and (3) a parametric BIM updating approach. Results from a commercial building project show that scan-vs-BIM is the most accurate approach, parametric BIM updating produces the most semantically rich gDT, and scan-to-BIM is a middle-tiered option, striking a balance between representational accuracy and semantic enrichment. This study concludes that future research should develop a hybrid solution of these gDT approaches and additional more accurate measurement technologies for optimal deployment in OSM. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102267353

Currently, the sector has to face profound industrial changes emerging with digital transformations (Industry 4.0), sustainability, climate change and energy efficiency. To promote the growth of the civil engineering sector and accelerate the recovery, we need to create a highly qualified and competent workforce that can handle the challenges coming up with the technological progress and global competitiveness. The main condition to achieve this capable workforce is to define the expected evolution of skills requirements. For that purpose, our work focuses on identifying current and near-future key skills required by the civil engineering occupations. To achieve this, we developed an automated sectoral database for the current and near-future skills requirements of the selected professional profiles. It is our belief that this sectoral database is a fundamental framework that will guide the sector through the future changes.

These tools are increasingly used in advanced industries for several purposes. The digital representation provides both the elements and the dynamics of how an Internet of Things (IoT) device operates and lives throughout its life cycle. Despite its complexity, the materialization of these digital artifacts in their simplest form imply the use of a threefold technology: sensors, data acquisition systems (DAS) and graphical user interfaces (GUI). This paper describes several educational exploratory tasks performed at the School of Civil Engineering in Barcelona (UPC) aimed at developing meaningful yet simple digital twins for civil engineering classrooms. The project encompasses the use of simple GUIs that show in real time physical systems from several disciplines such as structural engineering, soils mechanics, hydraulics, environmental engineering, coastal engineering or structural dynamics. The project has shown potential for civil engineering classrooms at two levels: i) these portable tools can be used pedagogically for demonstrating key concepts with a high degree of interactivity, ii) the development of these artifacts (from sensors to GUIs) may provide a key understanding of several concepts associated with IoT mechanics for civil engineering students. It is noteworthy that nowadays, average students are seldom acquainted with sensors, electronics and virtualization of physical magnitudes at Bachelor and Master level. IoT technologies will be needed in civil engineering classrooms in the following years due to the increasing trends related to automation, monitoring and digitalization that the construction industry will undertake. Experimental and numerical pedagogical activities may be enriched with this concept since they allow navigating from physical to virtual realms and vice versa.

Laser scanning technology has gained much attention in the area of GQI of manufactured planar-type construction elements such as precast concrete (PC) elements during the fabrication or manufacturing stage, due to its speed and accuracy. However, the scope of existing GQI techniques using laser scanning are limited to single surface GQI of planar-type construction elements. Because of this, a registration process is inevitably necessary to merge different sets of point cloud data acquired at multiple scanning locations. The current multiple scans and registration approach for the GQI of planar-type construction elements are, however, time consuming and error prone due to registration errors. This study aims to develop a registration-free GQI technique that is capable of scanning invisible side surfaces of planar-type elements from the terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) using flat mirrors in order to tackle the limitations of the prior GQI studies. Firstly, the geometrical relationship between the flat mirror and the invisible surfaces of the planar-type element is identified based on the mirror reflection principle of laser beams. The virtual scan points of the invisible side surfaces generated by the flat mirror are then transformed to the location of the actual side surface based on the identified geometrical relationship and the mirror plane estimated using rectangular patches attached to the mirror. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed registration-free GQI technique, a series of tests on a laboratory-scale specimen with varying scan parameters are conducted. In addition, comparison tests with traditional registration methods are performed to further analyze the performance of the proposed technique in terms of GQI accuracy and efficiency. The results show that the proposed technique provides more accurate GQI results while reducing scanning time compared to traditional registration methods, demonstrating great potential for application in the GQI of planar-type prefabricated construction elements during the fabrication stage. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096351938

The main goal of the VirScan3D project is to cover engineering digitisation by two major project parts: 1) Development of a virtual environment for creation and processing of digital 3D scan data; 2) Digital teaching and e-learning material with interactive tools and practical experiences. Part 1 will be solved through the development of a virtual system that allows users to create realistic data in the absence of a real measuring device. At the time of writing (April 2020) all higher education teaching and learning worldwide has been changed to online delivery due to the Covid pandemic. However, this has affected the courses that involve working with equipment and-consequently-require the presence of students and devices. In this project, the development of such equipment simulator proposes a real and feasible solution, which allows undisturbed continuing the teaching. The virtual scanner will be based on existing software packages. It will be part of a general e-learning concept that will be implemented in partner universities. Part 2 is addressed through an integrated teaching concept that includes interactive learning tools (for both teachers and students) and practical exercises (for example project weeks, summer schools) where the theoretical and virtual education is connected to practical experience with real instrumentation and data. One outcome of the experimental work is additional e-learning material based on the experiences and results of the project work. The prototype implementation of the virtual laser scanner is realized within a game engine, which allows for fast and easy 3D visualisation and navigation. Within this environment, the user can freely navigate and define suitable scanning positions/stations. At each scanning station a simulated scan is performed, which is based on the technical specifications of a real scanner. The mathematical solution is based on 3D line intersection with the virtual 3D surface including noise and colour as well as an intensity simulation. As a result, 3D point clouds for each station are generated, which will be further processed for registration and modelling using standard software packages. © 2020 Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091996876
