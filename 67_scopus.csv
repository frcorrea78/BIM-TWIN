Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in generalpurpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way. © 2008 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649119406

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

This technology will allow on-site quality inspectors to retrieve the virtual quality control baseline model which can be established according to the quality standard, and overlay that model onto the real segment displacement in AR. Therefore, the structural safety can be automatically evaluated by measuring the differences between the baseline model and the real facility view. Additionally, the feedback can be potentially used to explore how to enhance the tunnel's stability to avoid significant accidents. A case study has been conducted to evaluate the benefits of the inspection using a prototype AR system over a conventional method. The result shows that all inspections and analyses can be conducted on-site, in real-time, and at a very low cost.

However, while significant efforts have been made towards CPS application in several other industry sectors, the exploration of CPS benefits and applicability to the construction industry is at the initial stage. While CPS has been identified as a promising solution to address problems in the construction industry, few explorations have been made on CPS application to temporary structures, which have significant safety issues that urgently need to be addressed. With a focus on the enhanced monitoring of temporary structures to prevent potential structural failures, this study proposed a CPS-based temporary structures monitoring (TSM) system that integrates the virtual model of a temporary structure and the physical structure on the construction jobsite. In doing this, the applicability of CPS to temporary structures monitoring is investigated, and end user requirements and system requirements are identified for system design. In addition, a system architecture and a description of the issues surrounding the choice of a system development environment are presented. For better understanding of how the TSM works, aspects of the developed CPS-based TSM are presented with system workflow and simulated examples of the structural monitoring of a scaffolding system.

This smartness can enable better decision making in construction. Understanding of SCOs, however, is still in its infancy. Informed by theories on ubiquitous computing and general smart objects, this paper first defines the panoramic and interconnected properties that differentiate SCOs from conventional construction objects. Second, representative scenarios of the use of SCOs are given to illustrate the new workflow with enhanced smartness in the future. Next, using prefabrication construction as an example, this paper further elaborates SCOs using Industry Foundation Classes Extensible Markup Language and exploring their software/hardware representations.

The specific research issues addressed are (1) does augmented reality have a potential use in civil engineering, (2) how big - in comparison to other technologies - is this potential and (3) what are the main barriers to its adoption. The generic research issue was to develop a methodology for evaluation of potentials of technology. A prototype was built. It was tested on a real construction site to evaluate the potential of its use using the action-research method.

It argues for the effective integration of computational resources (such as wireless sensors, virtual prototyping,real-time tracking and data fusion) with the design and construction process, and outlines how bi-directional consistency can be maintained between the virtual models (which are often ignored once the physical construction commences) and the physical facility.

In that context, the present work aims to investigate how, and in which form, a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), one of many different but complementary technologies associated with the future of manufacturing, could be employed in the Construction industry. Recognizing that the core of CPS should be the dynamics of construction processes, the initial focus is in how to develop Process Data Models (virtual) that could communicate with Product Data Models (BIM models), and receive/send data in almost real-time from/for the existent hardware (sensors and actuators) in the physical production processes. This article present some preliminary work based on the standardized methodology of IDM/MVD, which are part of the buildingSMART solution for interoperability along with Industry Foundation Class (IFC) data schema. The proposed methodology considers an IDM modelled in Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) language in such detail as to expose the workflow of production. The contribution in this context is in mapping production processes in BPMN notation into Petri Nets (PN) semantics. Petri Nets are an adequate model to construction processes, with precise semantics and largely used in the simulation of discrete events. With PN models it would be possible to develop the BIM-based control strategy, and test and implement it in real controllers.
