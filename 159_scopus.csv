However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

It defines the three-dimensional geometry, topology, semantics and appearance of the most relevant topographic objects in urban or regional contexts. These definitions are provided in different, well-defined Levels-of-Detail (multiresolution model). The focus of CityGML is on the semantical aspects of 3D city models, its structures, taxonomies and aggregations, allowing users to employ virtual 3D city models for advanced analysis and visualization tasks in a variety of application domains such as urban planning, indoor/outdoor pedestrian navigation, environmental simulations, cultural heritage, or facility management. This is in contrast to purely geometrical/graphical models such as KML, VRML, or X3D, which do not provide sufficient semantics. CityGML is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML). , which provides a standardized geometry model. Due to this model and its well-defined semantics and structures, CityGML facilitates interoperable data exchange in the context of geo web services and spatial data infrastructures. Since its standardization in 2008, CityGML has become used on a worldwide scale: tools from notable companies in the geospatial field provide CityGML interfaces. Many applications and projects use this standard. CityGML is also having a strong impact on science: numerous approaches use CityGML, particularly its semantics, for disaster management, emergency responses, or energy-related applications as well as for visualizations, or they contribute to CityGML, improving its consistency and validity, or use CityGML, particularly its different Levels-of-Detail, as a source or target for generalizations.This paper gives an overview of CityGML, its underlying concepts, its Levels-of-Detail, how to extend it, its applications, its likely future development, and the role it plays in scientific research.

Past research has shown that use of occupancy sensors for control of lighting can save up to 30% electrical energy used for lighting. However, most of the sensors, which are currently being put to use, have a preset (sometimes user adjustable) time delay (TD) (the time after which the lights or any other load will be switched `off' after the last motion is detected by the sensor). If this TD is long then, it will have less energy savings, as the load will remain `on' during unoccupied period also. At the same time, if the TD is kept short then it may result in unwanted switching `off' (False Off) of the lights when no motion is detected during periods of occupancy. It has been observed in our research that the activity level of a user changes over the time of the day. Also, it is seen that activity level of different users is different. Hence, single TD for all the users and for all times of the day is not desirable. The commonly used sensors do not adapt to changing activity levels. In this paper, we present design of smart occupancy sensors which can adapt to changing activity levels. A model is also proposed for `human movement' of a person working at a computer. Smart occupancy sensor can learn the variation in activity level of the occupants with respect to time of the day. With this information, it can change the TD with time of the day.

This study introduces a newly developed tower crane navigation system that provides three-dimensional information about the building and surroundings and the position of the lifted object in real time using various sensors and a building information modeling (BIM) model. The system quality was evaluated in terms of two aspects, ease of use and usefulness, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory. The perceived ease of use of the system was improved from the initial 3.2 to 4.4 through an iterative design process. The tower crane navigation system was deployed on an actual construction site for 71 days, and the use patterns were video recorded.

Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin-enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio.

Effective and efficient disaster response and recovery require reliable situational awareness regarding infrastructure disruptions and their societal impacts. Due to the rapid unfolding and evolution of events in disasters and emergencies, typical data sensing techniques (such as remote sensing and satellite images) are not sufficient to gain reliable situational awareness about disruptions that affect communities at a local scale. Social sensing enables gathering and analyzing massive user-generated data from various sources (social media, in particular) to monitor unfolding of localized events such as infrastructure disruptions and community needs. To advance social sensing methods and their integration into digital twins of cities, this study proposes an integrated framework for detecting infrastructure disruptions based on three information elements embedded in social media content: images, texts, and geo-maps. The framework consists of three main methods: a graph-based approach for detecting critical tweets, an image-ranking algorithm for selecting important images, and a kernel density estimate for estimating the geographical scales of the disruptions. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study of water release from flood control reservoirs in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The findings illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework for capturing the critical situational information and interpreting the results for situational awareness and disruption response. The proposed framework can enhance integration of social sensing elements into smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Accordingly, the proposed framework can improve the ability of community members, volunteer responders, residents, and other stakeholders in coping with built environment disruptions in disasters. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077144069

To this effect, the authors: (1) conducted a meta-analysis of previous studies of dynamic modeling in construction management; (2) identified and defined interrelated dynamic parameters that impact project performance; and (3) used social network analysis (SNA) to quantitatively pinpoint the strengths and gaps in the literature and provide a roadmap toward the areas that should be further addressed.

Understanding cities' current states of physical vulnerability can support city decision makers in analyzing associated potential risk in urban areas for data-driven infrastructure management in extreme weather events. As a step toward creating a digital twin city for effective risk-informed decision-making, this paper proposes a new framework to bring crowdsourced visual data-based reality information into a three-dimensional (3D) virtual city for a model update with interactive and immersive visualization. Unstructured visual data are collected from participatory sensing and analyzed to estimate the geospatial information of vulnerable objects in the distance representing physical vulnerability in cities. The crowdsourced visual data-based reality information of physical vulnerability in a given region is then integrated with a 3D virtual city model, and the updated 3D city model is fed into a computer-aided virtual environment (CAVE) for immersive visualization to enable users to navigate the intersection of reality and virtuality. To test the proposed framework, case studies were conducted on Houston. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to make the virtual city model live in terms of local vulnerability.

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema. A case study using part of an office building and the results of its analysis are provided and discussed from the perspectives of applicability and accuracy.

Simulations are frequently used to increase this type of efficiency through diagnosis and evaluation of a physical asset. In particular, digital twin (DT) is currently attracting considerable attention as it provides technical functionality at the type and instance stages of a work center. In addition, DT can support efficient control and decision making with less gap in the site through vertical integration and horizontal coordination. Moreover, DT can contribute to prevent energy-related inefficiency by providing the functionalities required for the service composition of the technical functionalities that are defined for the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency. However, in terms of the provision of service-composition-based technical functionality of DT, no research has defined each step of the operation procedures of work-center-level DT application at a detailed level. This study proposes detailed operation procedures to create, synchronize, and utilize a work-center-level DT to provide appropriate service-composition-based technical functionality. To this end, the technical requirements were derived from the analysis of the service-composition-based technical functionality. This study systematically defined the various service-composition-based technical functionalities through a combination of various types of operation procedures.

Moving materials, equipment and men efficiently from place to place, in and in between projects, depends on good coordination and requires specialized information systems. The key to such information systems are appropriate approaches to collect de-centralized sensor readings and to process, and distribute them to multiple end users at different locations both during the construction process and after the project is finished. This paper introduces a framework for the support of such distributed data collection and management to foster real-time data collection and processing along with the provision of opportunities to retain highly precise data for post-process analyses. In particular, the framework suggests a scheme to benefit from exploiting readings from the same sensors in varying levels of detail for informing different levels of decision making: operational, tactical, and strategic. The sensor readings collected in this way are not only potentially useful to track, assess, and analyse construction operations, but can also serve as reference during the maintenance stage. To this extent, the framework contributes to the existing body of knowledge of construction informatics. The operationality of the framework is demonstrated by developing and applying two on site information systems to track asphalt paving operations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, collaboration among participants and specialties is critical in IPD projects. The challenge is that existing collaboration platforms may be unable to support the collaboration among multiple participants and specialties efficiently due to this characteristic. This paper formulates the application functional requirements for such a BIM-based collaboration platform by analysing case studies of IPD projects appearing in the literature and in industry documentations after formulating a 5-step method to justify whether a dedicated BIM-based collaboration platform needs to be developed for IPD projects and to facilitate its development if it is needed. First, the collaborative tasks among participants and specialties in IPD projects are identified with a DSM (Dependency Structure Matrix) method and verified by conducting a questionnaire with experts. Then, the application functional requirements are designed based on these collaborative tasks. Finally, 11 commercial collaboration platforms are examined to determine whether they can meet all the identified requirements and the requirements, which they cannot meet, are verified by conducting another questionnaire with experts. It is concluded that a dedicated BIM-based collaboration platform is necessary, and the formulated application functional requirements can be used in the development of such a platform or for customizing an existing commercial collaboration platform to better support IPD projects. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009892626

An early report of the research highlighted, in fact, a precise structure of contents both for pre-design (until tender) and for execution-phase design based on a systematic approach. The research is now going on applying Building Information Modeling technique to that structure, assuming the strategic role of site design in the whole design process in order to meet the safety goal as well as the time-cost requirements of a project. The actual stage issue is to identify and develop a standard design BIM-based method in order to create a proper ""Construction site information model"" (CoSIM). The final aim is therefore to help site designers to reach primarily the required health and safety employees' standards. CoSIM method needs to be supported by an inventory of BIM elements, made on 3d-models, supplied with their ergo-technique information. That inventory has been therefore developed upon a precise classification made on different elements type (equipment, facilities, plants) according to their function on construction site. The research methodology for translating ergo-technique contents in a BIM has followed therefore these steps: (i) definition of elements to be contained in a CoSIM; (ii) definition of graphical level of detail of the model and its elements; (iii) definition of ergo-technique information level of development; (iv) translation of the model into proper deliverables. Some results of the first three steps of the research here presented show the development of construction site design from the pre-design to the execution-design phase in a case study through which it has been possible to asses and refine some guidelines for the creation of the postulated Construction Site Information Model. © 2015 The Authors.

However, difficulties in time-dependent structural modeling and data fragmentation of different engineering and management systems remain unresolved, hindering the plan, do, check, and adjust (PDCA) loop for structural safety management during bridge construction. In this paper, an integrated framework for closed-loop management of structural safety based on multisource data integration is presented. The proposed framework consists of a bridge safety information model (BrSIM), algorithms for data integration and semi-automatic time-dependent structural model generation, and methods for structural safety warning and assessment. The proposed BrSIM and algorithms integrate data related to 3D products, schedule, structural simulation and monitoring from various engineering systems, which covers the main data for structural safety management during construction. Meanwhile, automatic calculation and generation of static loads and constraints of a structural model based on 3D product information and monitoring data are also considered. Demonstration in the construction of a long-span bridge shows that with the proposed framework, it is possible to visualize the construction process, generate time-dependent structural models and simulate, monitor and assess the structural safety dynamically. Thus, the structural safety management loop is automated and fully closed. Furthermore, by tracking and simulating the changes of structural performance over time, and comparing the difference between simulation results and monitoring data, earlier detection and better evaluation of potential structural risks are achieved. Moreover, efficiency of information modeling and sharing is improved and effective management and decision-making are achieved with the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059686550

In BIM processes, it is necessary to identify and exchange the specific information that is relevant in the exchange information requirements of each project. The concept of level of detail of the information is a tool for describing and quantifying the information that should be exchanged. But the existing definitions of level of detail of information are not easily usable. Precise definitions of methodology, tools and principles are needed to redefine this concept and to use it in order to define the elements of information that are relevant to be exchanged. Methods: The authors propose the use of System Engineering and Requirements Engineering to define BIM uses and the relevant level of detail of information and its modelling concerned by each BIM use. The authors first explain why, in this context, the existing definitions of LOD, which can mean level of detail, level of development, level of definition, etc., are not sufficient and not always coherent. They demonstrate through real use cases that System Engineering and Requirement Engineering are a part of this methodology and propose, using formalisms, to describe each BIM use in detail. Results: The authors apply two different approaches to defining the relevant information to each BIM use. Using a top-down conceptual approach they show that Level Of Detail (LOD) is a crucial element in defining the content of a BIM use. They then verify the practicality of their proposal using a bottom-up approach based on three use cases (acoustic studies, safety audit, sizing drainage system). These cases studies allow the authors to address different kinds of systems and objects within a whole infrastructure project. They represent domain use cases (acoustic and drainage) and coordination use cases (safety audit). This part of the work is based on the L2 project in Marseille, which is a Public Private Partnership for expressways. As a result, a methodology is proposed both to redefine the level of detail of information concept and to describe how this concept is used to complete the BIM uses definition. The system engineering and requirement engineering methods are partially adapted to infrastructure projects. These elements facilitate the description of BIM uses expected in BIM Execution Plans. It was necessary to change the definitions of LOD in order to make them compatible with the methods of requirement management. Conclusions: Design activities should be reorganized toward the common goal of meeting project needs and requirements. The authors demonstrate that the best way to meet requirements is to define BIM uses using a new definition of the level of detail of information. It has first to consider requirements that have to be reached through BIM and then define the relevant level of detail of information, using the concept of abstraction of reality. To do it well, applying system engineering and requirement engineering, adapted to infrastructure project, is required. To validate this proposal on an entire project, more use cases will be tested in further work. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044729003

If such duplicate tuples are observed, it is recommended to remove them and to replace them with one tuple that represents the joint information of the duplicate tuples to a maximal extent. This remove-and-replace operation is called a fusion operation. Within the setting of a relational database management system, the removal of the original duplicate tuples can breach referential integrity. In this paper, a strategy is proposed to maintain referential integrity in a semantically correct manner, thereby optimizing the quality of relationships in the database. An algorithm is proposed that is able to propagate a fusion operation through the entire database. The algorithm is based on a framework of first and second order fusion functions on the one hand, and conflict resolution strategies on the other hand. It is shown how classical strategies for maintaining referential integrity, such as delete cascading, are highly specialized cases of the proposed framework. Experimental results are reported that (i) show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and (ii) show the differences in quality between several second order fusion functions.

However, many factors have caused fires at construction sites, where workers are in close proximity and large amounts of materials and machinery are stored. Traditional smoke- and temperature-based sensors cannot be used because of the open-environment conditions and environmental complexities of construction sites. Moreover, traditional fire management on site mainly relies on artificial patrol mode, which is inefficient. Most previous studies focused on traditional real-time fire monitoring of constructed buildings. Therefore, a new, intelligent, and effective method should be developed for real-time fire monitoring of construction sites. The current study proposed a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which is suitable for various construction environments and can recognize real-time fires on site. This research built a fire-recognition model and developed a real-time construction fire detection (RCFD) system. Experiments were conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed system in different environmental conditions. Experimental results showed that the fire detection model based on the CNN algorithm can be applied to various field construction environments, and the recognition accuracy is above 90%.

The advent and the continuous development of BIM applications permitted to focus more on this issue and to transform the way of design and manage construction. As known the management of a project is divided in different phases from the early draft to the management of the maintenance. Each of this phase need a different level of information development and also a different graphic detail according to the need of each project. International standards developed different scales for these two issues such as the LOD scale of the American Institute of Architects, taken as guideline in different standards. Since the need of developing a proper construction site plan during each phase of the design process, the level of development of construction elements need to be standardized as well. The paper presents then the development of a LOD scale for construction site elements such as equipment, temporary structures, etc. In particular it considers the phases between the draft design and the detailed design, developed by a client designer. In addition to this it considers the construction phase developed by contractors for the installation design. This according to the systematic approach proposed in an earlier report of research.
