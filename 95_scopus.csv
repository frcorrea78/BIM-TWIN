The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm. © 2015 International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR.

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. Copyright 2010 by the authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862277874

This paper presents the development of a Modelica library for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based building energy simulation (ModelicaBIM library) using an Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) approach and Modelica, an equation-based OOPM language. By using the ModelicaBIM library, our project investigates system interfaces between BIM and energy simulation, which can perform semi-automatic translation from the building models in BIM to building energy modeling (BEM) using a BIM's authoring tool's Application Programming Interface (API). The ModelicaBIM library consists of OOPM-based BIM classes and OOPM-based BIM structure. OOPM-based BIM classes represent building component information. OOPM-based BIM structure consists of test case models that demonstrate (i) how building information in BIM can be transformed to OOPM and (ii) how design operations in BIM, such as changing a building geometry and editing building components, can be translated into BEM. A case study for simulation result comparisons has been conducted using (i) OOPM-based BIM models in the ModelicaBIM library and (ii) LBNL Modelica Buildings library (a Modelica-based building thermal simulation library developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).

Building professionals are increasingly expected to improve energy performance of their design. To achieve a high level of energy performance, multidisciplinary simulation-based optimization can be utilized to help designers in exploring more design alternatives and making informed decisions. Because of the high complexity in setting up a building model for multi-objective design optimization, there is a great demand of utilizing and integrating the advanced modeling and simulation technologies, including BIM, parametric modeling, cloud-based simulation, and optimization algorithms, as well as a new user interface that facilitates the setup of building parameters (decision variables) and performance fitness functions (design objectives) for automatically generating, evaluating, and optimizing multiple design options. This paper presents an integrated framework for building information modeling (BIM)-based performance optimization, BPOpt. This framework enables designers to explore design alternatives using an open-source, visual programming user interface on the top of a widely used BIM platform, to generate models of building design options, assess the environmental performance of the models through cloud-based simulation, and search for the most appropriate design alternatives. This paper details the process of the development of BPOpt and also provides a case study to show its application. The case study demonstrates the use of BPOpt in minimizing the energy consumption while maximizing the appropriate daylighting level for a residential building. Finally, strengths, limitations, current adoption by academia and industry, and future improvements of BPOpt for high-performance building design are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Its application from developing 3D models, structural analysis, cost estimation, and mechanical analysis has now expanded to other applications such as energy simulation. Multiple computer-aided design (CAD) tools work as BIM authoring tools to generate BIM files in different formats containing various types of building information. In addition, there are various building energy modeling (BEM) tools capable of importing these BIM files to perform energy simulation. However, such tools have various capabilities and limitations and need to be investigated and categorized in order to facilitate choosing a proper tool for design professionals in different phases of project and purposes. In addition, interoperability and data exchange issues between BIM and BEM tools should be understood in order to find solutions such as developing proper corrective middleware tools to rectify them. This paper reviews the challenges, issues, and shortcomings in BIM-to-BEM interoperability process (BBIP) by proposing a detailed classification for these issues and studying the available solutions. The paper also explains how a corrective middleware, which is developed by the authors using Python, can be utilized to modify a gbXML file prior to adoption in energy simulation to resolve the issues related to building envelope in BBIP. To do so, initially a review is presented on research studies focused on different types of BIM schemas such as IFC and gbXML and energy simulation tools capable of reading these files such as Green Building Studio (GBS), DesignBuilder, Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES), and OpenStudio. In addition, some of the challenges in the application of BIM for energy simulation such as interoperability issues, lack of standards, and lack of easy solutions for extending existing BIM schemas and available corresponding solutions are also reviewed. With the focus on building envelope in mind, three case studies are discussed to observe the challenges and issues with respect to BBIP using Revit, GBS, and OpenStudio. Moreover, these case studies provide an opportunity to investigate the application of corrective middleware tools similar to what is developed in the study presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056487862

Therefore, it is essential to decrease their energy consumption by improving the design of new buildings or renovating existing buildings. Heat losses or gains through building envelopes affect the energy use and the indoor condition. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems are responsible for 33% and 25% of the total energy consumption in office buildings, respectively. However, renovating building envelopes and energy consuming systems to lessen energy losses is usually expensive and has a long payback period. Despite the significant contribution of research on optimizing energy consumption, there is limited research focusing on the renovation of existing buildings to minimize their Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and environmental impact using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This paper aims to find the optimal scenario for the renovation of institutional buildings considering energy consumption and LCA while providing an efficient method to deal with the limited renovation budget. Different scenarios can be compared in a building renovation strategy to improve energy efficiency. Each scenario considers several methods including the improvement of the building envelopes, HVAC and lighting systems. However, some of these scenarios could be inconsistent and should be eliminated. Another consideration in this research is the appropriate coupling of renovation scenarios. For example, the HVAC system must be redesigned when renovating the building envelope to account for the reduced energy demand and to avoid undesirable side effects. A genetic algorithm (GA), coupled with an energy simulation tool, is used for simultaneously minimizing the energy consumption, LCC, and environmental impact of a building. A case study is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056836730

Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034624206

Improving the energy performance of buildings is a critical element of building energy conservation. Furthermore, renovating existing buildings’ envelopes and systems offers significant opportunities for reducing Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and minimizing negative environmental impacts. This approach can be considered as one of the key strategies for achieving sustainable development goals at a relatively low cost, especially when compared with the demolition and reconstruction of new buildings. One of the main methodological and technical issues of this approach is selecting a desirable renovation strategy among a wide range of available options. The main idea and motivation behind this study relies on trying to bridge the gap between Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization (SBMO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For a whole building simulation and optimization, current SBMOs often need thousands of simulation evaluations. Therefore, the optimization becomes unfeasible because of the computation time and complexity of the dependent parameters. To this end, one feasible technique to solve this problem is to implement surrogate models to computationally imitate expensive real building simulation models. The objective of the research focuses on developing a robust ANN to explore vast and complex data generated from the SBMO model. More specifically, this research aims to propose an accurate ANN to predict energy consumption using data from the SBMO model. The proposed model will potentially offer new venues to predict Total Energy Consumption (TEC), LCC, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for different renovation scenarios, and select the optimum scenario. To illustrate the applicability of the model, a case study was developed and the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated. Results show that models constructed using ANNs are considerably less time-consuming than the conventional Building Energy Model (BEM) while achieving acceptable accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065970414

These buildings require energy refurbishment that takes into account the preservation of their architectural heritage. In this view, this work studies an innovative integrated modelling and simulation framework consisting of the implementation of Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) for the energy retrofit of historical buildings with renewable geothermal HVAC system. To this aim, the field case study is part of a medieval complex in Central Italy (Perugia), as representative ancient rural offshore architecture in the European countryside. The system involves of a ground source heat pump, a water tank for thermal-energy storage connected to a low-temperature radiant system, and an air-handling unit. The building heating energy performance, typically influenced by thermal inertia in historical buildings, when coupled to the novel HVAC system, is comparatively assessed against a traditional scenario implementing a natural-gas boiler, and made inter-operative within the HBIM ad hoc platform. Results show that the innovative renewable energy system provides relevant benefits while preserving minor visual and architectural impact within the historical complex, and also in terms of both energy saving, CO2 emissions offset, and operation costs compared to the traditional existing system. The integrated HBIM approach may effectively drive the path toward regeneration and re-functioning of heritage in Europe. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

At present, the research on individual thermal comfort does not consider its implementation mode. Moreover, the improvement of energy saving efficiency under the premise of increasing human comfort is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. In this paper, we proposed a Building Information Model (BIM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system to solve this problem. The system consists of two parts including an ANN predictive model considering the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, the persons' position, and an innovative plugin of BIM to realize dynamic evaluation and energy efficient design. The ANN model has three layers, considering three environment parameters (air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed around the person), three human state parameters (human metabolism rate, clothing thermal resistance, and the body position) and four body parameters (gender, age, height, and weight) as inputs. The plugin provides two functions. One is to provide corresponding personal thermal comfort evaluation results with dynamic changes of parameters returned byWireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The other one is to provide energy saving optimization suggestions for interior space design by simulating the energy consumption index of different design schemes. In the data test, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the established ANN model was about 0.39, while the MSE of traditional PMV model was about 2.1. The system realized the integration of thermal information and a building model, thereby providing guidance for the creation of a comfortable and green indoor environment. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072648964

Energy savings and indoor climate comfort are key demands for sustainable building refurbishment. Especially in schools, indoor comfort is an extremely important issue. A case study of energy consumption in selected school buildings in temperate climatic conditions of Central Europe region was performed. The studied buildings are representatives of various school premises constructed throughout the last century. The evaluation was based on data analysis of energy audits. The goal was aimed at assessment of the school building envelopes and their influence on energy consumption. One of the studied schools was selected for detailed evaluation. The school classroom was monitored for indoor thermal and visual environments. The monitoring was performed to compare the current state and renovation scenarios. Results of the evaluation show that the school buildings are highly inefficient even if renovated. Indoor climate in classrooms is largely influenced by windows. Solar gains affect interior thermal stability and daylighting. Thermal insulation quality of building envelopes and efficient solar shading systems appear to be fundamental tasks of school renovation strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

At present, buildings are responsible for 40% of the energy consumption in Europe and, so, there is a growing interest in reducing their energy use. In this context, proper interoperability between BIM and building energy model (BEM) is paramount for integrating the digital world into the construction sector and, therefore, increasing competitiveness by saving costs. This paper evaluates whether there is an automated or semi-automated BIM to BEM workflow that could improve the building design process. For this purpose, a residential building and a warehouse are constructed using the same BIM authoring tool (Revit), where two open schemas were used: green building extensible markup language (gbXML) and industry foundation classes (IFC). These transfer files were imported into software compatible with the EnergyPlus engine—Design Builder, Open Studio, and CYPETHERM HE—in which simulations were performed. Our results showed that the energy models were built up to 7.50% smaller than in the BIM and with missing elements in their thermal envelope. Nevertheless, the materials were properly transferred to gbXML and IFC formats. Moreover, the simulation results revealed a huge difference in values between the models generated by the open schemas, in the range of 6 to 900 times. Overall, we conclude that there exists a semi-automated workflow from BIM to BEM which does not work well for big and complex buildings, as they present major problems when creating the energy model. Furthermore, most of the issues encountered in BEM were errors in the transfer of BIM data to gbXML and IFC files. Therefore, we emphasise the need to improve compatibility between BIM and model exchange formats by their developers, in order to promote BIM–BEM interoperability. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, effective design measures need to be taken to ensure efficient usage and management of new structures. The challenging task for designers is to reduce energy demands while maintaining a high-quality indoor environment and low costs of construction and operations. This study proposes a methodological framework that enables decision-makers to resolve conflicts between energy demand and life cycle costs. A case study is analyzed to validate the proposed method, adopting different solutions for walls, roofs, floors, windows, window-to-wall ratios and geographical locations. Models are created on the basis of all the possible combinations between these elements, enriched by their thermal properties and construction/management costs. After the alternative models are defined, energy analyses are carried out for an estimation of consumption. By calculating the total cost of each model as the sum of construction, energy and maintenance costs, a joint analysis is carried out for variable life cycles. The obtained results from the proposed method confirm the importance of a preliminary assessment from both energy and cost points of view, and demonstrate the impact of considering different building life cycles on the choice of design alternatives. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091187833

The countries belonging to the European Union shall be obliged to transpose the Directive and adapt their procedures to that effect. The paper analyzes the IFC format, the only one recognized by the European Directive Standards for BIM procedures, to assess its use for simulations of buildings. IFC, described by the ISO 16739:2013 standard (ISO, 2013), is a standard that describes the topology of the constructive elements of the building and what belongs to it, overall. The format includes geometrical information on the rooms and on all building components, including details of the type of performance (transmittance, fire resistance, sound insulation), in other words it is an independent object file for the software producers to which, according to the European Directive, it will be compulsory to refer in the near future, during the different stages of the life of a building from the design phase, to management, and the possible demolition at the end of its life. The present study aims at carrying out a first analysis on the IFC data format, which will be further studied in-depth in the following phases. The study will compare the information and data contained in it, with those in other formats already used for energy simulations of buildings such as the gbXML (Green Building XML), highlighting the required information missing, and proposing the inclusion of new data for energetic and acoustic simulation.

One of the applications of BIM is to estimate buildings energy demand and foster the introduction of more efficient design alternatives. BIM creates information to support designers' decision-making and to allow them to compare and select the best options, enhancing buildings energy efficiency. With the increasing use of BIM and energy simulation tools, there is a need to establish a common and valid procedure for buildings energy assessment. Material and Methods By carrying out a building simulation with BIM, this paper identifies and describes the fundamental stages and requirements to perform a reliable, concise and fast energy assessment. These guidelines will consider Autodesk Revit as a BIM platform to create and prepare the building 3D model. Results The proposed guidelines cover all the required tasks for a BIM energy assessment, as the building modulation details and requirements, the software interoperability modes and restrictions and the comparison and selection of improvement measures. Inputs and advice are given regarding the use of some of the existing energy simulation BIM tools. Conclusions With the increasing number of studies addressing energy simulations with BIM, it is essential to define a set of requisites to precisely perform them. By identifying the minimum requirements and tasks, the proposed guidelines will support future studies in achieving more reliable and comparable results. The possibility to estimate and improve the energy demand of a building during the initial project stages allows for the opportunity to build high performance and more sustainable buildings. BIM capabilities might be an essential support to effectively improve the built environment energy efficiency and accomplish environmental goals. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.
