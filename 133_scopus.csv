Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619234

The crack quantification model evaluates crack lengths based on the perimeter of the skeleton of a crack which considers the tortuosity of the crack. The change detection model is based on the Fourier Transform of digital images eliminating the need for image registration as required in the traditional.

The paper presents definitions of the semantics of the topological operators within, contain, touch, overlap, disjoint and equal in 3D space by using the 9-intersection model.

A project's building information model (BIM) needs to be regularly updated to more accurately reflect the actual site conditions. However, conventional practices lack site-data integration with models and rely on manual, error-prone, and costly updates. This paper proposes and demonstrates a robust technique that uses the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema to automatically update an as-designed BIM based on site observations for inspected building elements. It receives as input an inspected object's actual type and inspection details including the detected defects/changes, responsible actors, as-built/as-is type, captured images, and time and the date of the inspection. The algorithm automatically analyzes the IFC data model to retrieve the element's semantics and identifies discrepancies between the as-built/as-is and as-designed object conditions. Based on the results of the discrepancy analysis, the IFC data model is populated with new semantics, resulting in the update of object types, properties, and three-dimensional (3D) shape representations.

To overcome this problem, this research aims to ensure the preservation of relevant information through the use of building information modeling (BIM) methodology. By developing historic building information models (HBIMs), it is possible to enhance the architectural heritage. This represents an opportunity to incorporate digital media into the global heritage conservation field. To achieve this goal, a historical castle was selected as a case study; this unique piece of architecture is located in the Piedmont Region, close to city of Turin (Italy). The results show a direct relation between a historical digital model, finalized to the management of architectural and system components, and visualization tools.

In this paper, a new algorithm that integrates the mobile point cloud and images is proposed for the detection of road potholes. The algorithm includes three steps: 2D candidate pothole extraction from the images using a deep learning method, 3D candidate pothole extraction via a point cloud, and pothole determination by depth analysis. Because the texture features of the pothole and asphalt or concrete patches greatly differ from those of a normal road, pothole or patch distress images are used to establish a training set and train and test the deep learning system. Subsequently, the 2D candidate pothole is extracted from the images and labeled via the trained DeepLabv3+, a state-of-the-art pixel-wise classification (semantic segmentation) network. The edge of the candidate pothole in the image is then used to establish the relationship between the mobile point cloud and images. The original road point cloud around the edge of the candidate pothole is categorized into two groups, that is, interior and exterior points, according to the relationship between the point cloud and images. The exterior points are used to fit the road plane and calculate the accurate 3D shape of the candidate potholes. Finally, the interior points of a candidate pothole are used to analyze the depth distribution to determine if the candidate pothole is a pothole or patch. To verify the proposed method, two cases, including real and simulation cases, are selected. The real case is an expressway in Shanghai with a length of 26.4 km. Based on the proposed method, 77 candidate potholes are extracted by the DeepLabv3+ system; 49 potholes and 28 patches are finally filtered. The affected lanes and pothole locations are analyzed. The simulation case is selected to verify the geometric accuracy of the detected potholes.

However, oblique images have been already captured over many cities of the world, and the exploitation of pre- and post-event data as inputs to damage assessment is readily feasible in urban areas. In this paper, we investigate the potential of multi-temporal oblique imagery for detailed damage assessment focusing on two methodologies: the first method aims at detecting severe structural damages related to geometrical deformation by combining the complementary information provided by photogrammetric point clouds and oblique images. The developed method detected 87% of damaged elements. The failed detections are due to varying noise levels within the point cloud which hindered the recognition of some structural elements. We observed, in general that the façade regions are very noisy in point clouds. To address this, we propose our second method which aims to detect damages to building façades using the oriented oblique images. The results show that the proposed methodology can effectively differentiate among the three proposed categories: collapsed/highly damaged, lower levels of damage and undamaged buildings, using a computationally light-weight approach. We describe the implementations of the above mentioned methods in detail and present the promising results achieved using multi-temporal oblique imagery over the city of L'Aquila (Italy).",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042358285

This paper considers the application of BrIM for the proposed rehabilitation of a heritage listed viaduct. The structure under consideration is the landmark Chetwynd viaduct in Cork (Ireland), which formed part of the Cork-Bandon railway infrastructure constructed in 1851 and decommissioned in 1961. As with infrastructure of its type, few as-built records exist. Consequently, the geometry, material properties and condition of the existing structure are required to inform the initial feasibility assessment and subsequent design, construction and operation of this viaduct asset. Respective BrIM and traditional approaches to the data capture phase are outlined and compared in terms of time, expertise and deliverables. The significant deliverables from the traditional approach include a three-dimensional (3D) solid model and independent 2D drawings. Significant deliverables achieved using a BrIM approach include an intelligent parametric 3D model and associated 2D drawings, as well as integrated datasets representative of the 'as-is' structure.

Since terrestrial Laserscanning System (TLS) Manufacturers have strongly increased the amount and speed of data captured with a single scan at each system upgrade and cutting down system costs the use of TLS Systems for recording cultural heritage is an option for recording worth to think about beside traditional methods like Photogrammetric. TLS Systems can be a great tool for capturing complex cultural heritage object within a short amount of time beside the traditional methods but can be a nightmare to handle for further process if not used right while capturing. Furthermore TLS Systems still have to be recognized as survey equipment, even though some of the manufactures promote them as everyday tool. They have to be used in an intelligent way having in mind the clients and the individual cultural objects needs. Thus the efficient way to use TLS Systems for data recording becomes a relevant topic to deal with the huge Amount of data the Systems collect while recording. Already small projects can turn into huge Pointcloud Datasets that End user, like Architects or Archaeologist neither can't deal with as their technical equipment doesn't fit the requirements of the Dataset nor do they have the software tools to use the Data as the current software tools still are high prized. Even the necessary interpretation of the Dataset can be a tough task if the people who have to work on with the Pointcloud aren't educated right in order to understand TLS and the results it creates The use of TLS Systems has to have in mind the project requirements of the individual Heritage Object, like the required accuracy, standards for Levels of Details (e.g. ""Empfehlungen für die Baudokumentation, Günther Eckstein, Germany), the required kind of Deliverables (Visualization, 2D Drawings, True Deformation Drawings, 3D Models, BIM or 4D - Animations) as well as the Projects budget, restrictions and special conditions of the object.

Their use in condition assessment has increased significantly, due to technological and computational progress. UAS play a crucial role in developing a digital maintenance strategy for infrastructure, saving cost and effort, while increasing safety and reliability. Part of that strategy are automated visual UAS inspections of the building’s condition. The resulting images can automatically be analyzed to identify and localize damages to the structure that have to be monitored. Further interest in parts of a structure can arise from events like accidents or collisions. Areas of low interest exist, where low resolution monitoring is sufficient. From different requirements for resolution, different levels of detail can be derived. They require special image acquisition parameters that differ mainly in the distance between camera and structure. Areas with a higher level of detail require a smaller distance to the object, producing more images. This work proposes a multi-scale flight path planning procedure, enabling higher resolution requirements for areas of special interest, while reducing the number of required images to a minimum. Careful selection of the camera positions maintains the complete coverage of the structure, while achieving the required resolution in all areas.
