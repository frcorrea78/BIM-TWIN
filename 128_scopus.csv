This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach $2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly $4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928886679

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894347279

These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant.

Culminating in a 6-m-tall tower composed of 1500 foam modules (see Figures 1 and 2), the installation was assembled by four quadrocopters in 18 hours during a four-day-long live exhibition at the Fonds Rgional d'Art Contemporain (Regional Contemporary Art Fund) du Centre in Orlans, France. This article documents the design and development of specific elements of the autonomous system behind this one-of-a-kind installation and describes the process and challenges of bringing such a complex system out of the laboratory and into the public realm, where live demonstration and human-in-the-loop interaction demand high levels of robustness, dependability, and safety. The installation is a 1:100 scale model of what was originally conceived of as a 600 m-high vertical village (see The Vertical Village for details) and is an exploration of aerial construction in architecture. Architects have been exploring the use of digital technologies for the design and assembly of structures for some time now, and many facilities for investigating nonstandard architectural design and fabrication using industrial robots have sprung up in the past decade [2]-[4]. However, robot arms and computer numerical control (CNC) machines are limited by predefined working areas that constrain the size of the workpiece they can act upon and are thus also limited in their scale of action to a small portion or component of the overall structure, or to model-sized fabrication [5]. In contrast, flying machines are not constrained by such tight boundaries. The space that flying machines can act upon is substantially larger than the size of the machines themselves, making it feasible for the machines to work on the structure as a whole at a 1:1 scale, thus offering architects a new framework for realizing their designs. © 1991-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904682980

In materials science, self-organized soft helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), serve as model systems toward the understanding of morphology- and orientation-dependent properties of supramolecular dynamic helical architectures and their potential for technological applications. Moreover, most of the fascinating device applications of CLCs are primarily determined by different orientations of the helical axis. Here, the control of the helical axis orientation of CLCs and its dynamic switching in two and three dimensions using different external stimuli are summarized. Electric-field-, magnetic-field-, and light-irradiation-driven orientation control and reorientation of the helical axis of CLCs are described and highlighted. Different techniques and strategies developed to achieve a uniform lying helix structure are explored. Helical axis control in recently developed heliconical cholesteric systems is examined. The control of the helical axis orientation in spherical geometries such as microdroplets and microshells fabricated from these enticing photonic fluids is also explored.

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062655898

Due to fact that CN are currently a reality and the operators are continuously improving the network, this communication technology could be considered as a candidate to deal with V2V necessities as well. The present paper defends the applicability of CN in the V2V field, and presents a novel communication paradigm for vehicles which unifies both V2V and V2I paradigms into one system.

PUFs provide ""digital fingerprints,"" where information is usually read from the static entropy of a system, rather than having an identity artificially programmed in, preventing a malicious party from making a copy for nefarious use later on.

Industrialization is basically the aggregation of a large market to divide into fractions the investment in strategies and technologies capable, in return, of simplifying the production and therefore reducing the costs. Simplification is the goal. Whereas the first four degrees of industrialization (i.e., prefabrication, mechanization, automation, robotics) remain at the level of duplicating the traditional construction processes, the fifth degree, reproduction, seeks innovative processes capable of short-cutting the repetitive linear operations of craftsmanship nature. A methodology can be extrapolated from the analogical model of printing (from the electronic printed circuit to the printed plumbing core). Adopting this methodology implies three steps: (i) generating the geometry of the product from the performance criteria; (ii) selecting a process that can simplify the materialisation; and (iii) designing the product accordingly. The load-bearing service core offers a relevant case study of that methodology: the space is distributed between the served and serving areas, the latter being concentrated into a value-added factory-made module capable of generating diversified building types. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Reviewing 39 selected peer-reviewed journal papers reveals 28 different forms of corruption. The most reported corruption forms in the literature are bribery, fraud, collusion, embezzlement, nepotism, and extortion. A conceptual framework is also developed for better understanding of the forms. The findings of this study contribute to deepened understanding of the forms of corruption in the construction industry, which would be useful for industry practitioners, policy makers, and anticorruption institutions to develop suitable anticorruption frameworks and strategies to effectively deal with corrupt practices in construction.

The presented research designed and implemented algorithms that address these challenges and enable autonomous robotic assembly of freeform modular structures on construction sites. Building on the authors' previous work in computer-vision-based pose estimation, the designed algorithms enable a mobile robotic manipulator to: 1) autonomously identify and grasp prismatic building components (e.g., bricks, blocks) that are typically non-unique and arbitrarily stored on-site; and 2) assemble these components into pre-designed modular structures. The algorithms use a single camera and a visual marker-based metrology to rapidly establish local reference frames and to detect staged building components. Based on the design of the structure being assembled, the algorithms automatically determine the assembly sequence. Furthermore, if a 3D camera is mounted on the manipulator, 3D point clouds can be readily captured and registered into a same reference frame through our marker-based metrology and the manipulator's internal encoders, either after construction to facilitate as-built Building Information Model (BIM) generation, or during construction to document details of the progress. Implemented using a 7-axis KUKA KR100 robotic manipulator, the presented robotic system has successfully assembled various structures and created as-built 3D point cloud models autonomously, demonstrating the designed algorithms' effectiveness in autonomous on-site construction robotics applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944441544

Flowers uniform in colour to humans, however, can appear patterned to insects due to spatial variation in UV reflectance on petals. A UV 'bullseye' pattern that is common among angiosperms - UV-absorbing petal bases and UV-reflective apices - purportedly functions as a nectar guide, enhancing pollinator orientation and experimental evidence suggests that UV reflectance increases floral apparency to pollinators. We test the pollinator-attracting and pollinator-orienting functions of floral UV pattern and UV reflectance under natural conditions. Specifically, we address whether UV reflection alone, or UV pattern influences small bee and syrphid fly attraction rates (approaching, landing and foraging visits), foraging rates, and likelihood of foraging and orienting to the centre of flowers, using Argentina anserina, a species whose flowers exhibit variability in the size of the UV bullseye. We manipulated UV properties while maintaining uniformly yellow petals to create three phenotypes - uniformly UV-absorptive, uniformly UV-reflective, and inversed bullseye (reflective bases and absorptive apices) and compared insect visitation and behaviour to control flowers with the common UV bullseye phenotype. The presence of UV pattern increased attraction rates by both bees and syrphid flies relative to either fully UV reflective or absorptive flowers. However, only in the inverse array did the bullseye phenotype elicit higher foraging rates than the test flower. Neither the presence of pattern, nor the reversal of the common pattern influenced the likelihood of pollinator foraging or orientating to the flowers' centre during a visit. We provide some of the first evidence to suggest that flowers with spatial variation in UV reflectance may be more conspicuous to insects than those with petals that uniformly absorb or reflect UV, all of which are naturally occurring phenotypes. Further, we verify that the most common UV pattern in nature increases insect attraction and foraging rate relative to the inverse pattern. Results confirm a distance apparency function of the UV bullseye, but we argue for reconsideration of the notion that pollinators benefit from this ubiquitous floral motif through enhanced foraging efficiency. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904354964

Ongoing research hints at future LC-based technologies of entirely different types, for instance by taking advantage of the peculiar behavior of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) subject to curvature. Spherical shells of CLC reflect light omnidirectionally with specific polarization and wavelength, tunable from the UV to the infrared (IR) range, with complex patterns arising when many of them are brought together. Here, these properties are analyzed and explained, and future application opportunities from an interdisciplinary standpoint are discussed. By incorporating arrangements of CLC shells in smart facades or vehicle coatings, or in objects of high value subject to counterfeiting, game-changing future uses might arise in fields spanning information security, design, and architecture.

The coating is fabricated through polymerization of chiral reactive mesogens aligned in their fingerprint mode on top of interdigitated electrodes. The fingerprint mode gives a corrugation of the surface perpendicular to the helix axes. When a lateral alternating electric field is applied, the order parameter of the helicoidally packed mesogens is reduced. This simultaneously leads to an inversion of the fingerprint heights, an overall thickness increase, and a chaotic and fast surface oscillation. These three effects work in concert stimulating wavy deformation figures at the coating surface. The process is fast and reversible; the dynamics of the topographic textures stop immediately when the electric field is switched off. The continuous generation of surface undulations sustains transport of species at the coating surface. It removes dust and debris providing an active dust control. © 2018 The Authors.

So far actions towards reducing energy consumption and emissions have not caused a decrease in global emissions. One of the key reasons for this is the presence of Jevons paradox, where the combined demand for transport grew faster than underwent the efficiency improvement of energy consumption and emissions reduction. One of the main reason for this is that vehicles offered on the market (especially cars) are characterized by an increase in weight and engine power. Broad implementation of autonomous vehicle (AV) can be a turning point in terms of reducing emissions of GHG.

Emerging applications range from electronics and telecommunication to health, defence and security. In particular, data transmission and communication technologies are currently asking for increasingly complex and fast devices, and therefore there is a growing interest in materials that can be used to transmit light and also to control the distribution of light in space and time. Here, we design chiral nematic microspheres whose shape enables them to reflect light of different wavelengths and handedness in all directions. Assembled in organized hexagonal superstructures, these microspheres of well-defined sizes communicate optically with high selectivity for the colour and chirality of light. Importantly, when the microspheres are doped with photo-responsive molecular switches, their chiroptical communication can be tuned, both gradually in wavelength and reversibly in polarization. Since the kinetics of the ""on"" and ""off"" switching can be adjusted by molecular engineering of the dopants and because the photonic cross-communication is selective with respect to the chirality of the incoming light, these photo-responsive microspheres show potential for chiroptical all-optical distributors and switches, in which wavelength, chirality and direction of the reflected light can be controlled independently and reversibly. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

So far the patterns are investigated exclusively as function of reflections at the sphere exterior. Here it is shown that the cholesteric shells in a microfluidics produced double emulsion enable also a sequence of internal reflections if the shells have sufficiently thin top and thick bottom. While such asymmetry is promoted by buoyancy when the internal droplet has lower density than the liquid crystal, the elasticity of the cholesteric helix prefers a symmetric shell geometry, acting against gravity. This subtle balance can hide the internal reflections for long time. Eventually, however, the asymmetry is established, revealing a new class of photonic patterns characterized by colored sharp concentric rings.

Marker systems are useful for many modern visual applications such as augmented reality, robot navigation and collaboration, industrial and space robotics, and human-robot interaction. A variety of applications demands certain quality assurance for marker properties. Among the most common criteria are resistance to partial occlusion and rotation, sensitivity to lightning conditions, marker size, false positive and false negative rates. This paper compares three types of markers for their resistance to partial occlusion in various types of occlusion and resistance to normal, lateral, and longitudinal rotations. Intensive experimental comparison of tags is presented with analysis. Detection of markers was performed with a common Web camera. Based on our experimental results, we have selected a marker system, which should be preferred for real world applications when only simple inexpensive hardware is available and appearance of rotation and occlusion disturbances are expected in the environment. Our long term goal is to calibrate humanoid robot manipulators in real-world environment applying a pre-calibrated camera of the robot, while the presented in this paper results help selecting a most suitable marker system for further calibration procedures. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In particular, CLCs confined in microcompartments are useful for sensing, lasing, and optical barcoding at the microscale. The integration of distinct CLCs into single microstructures can provide advanced functionality. In this work, CLC multishells with multiple stopbands are created by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a simple yet highly controlled manner. A homogeneous ternary mixture of LC, hydrophilic liquid, and co-solvent is microfluidically emulsified to form uniform oil-in-water drops, which undergo LLPS to form onion-like drops composed of alternating CLC-rich and CLC-depleted layers. The multiplicity is controlled from one to five by adjusting the initial composition of the ternary mixture, which dictates the number of consecutive steps of LLPS. Interestingly, the concentration of the chiral dopant becomes reduced from the outermost to the innermost CLC drop due to uneven partitioning during LLPS, which results in multiple stopbands. Therefore, the photonic multishells show multiple structural colors. In addition, dye-doped multishells provide band-edge lasing at two different wavelengths. This new class of photonic multishells will provide new opportunities for advanced optical applications. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086148614

To exploit the full potential of CLC emulsions as distributed Bragg reflection (DBR) mode laser resonators, monodispersed water-in-CLC-in-water double emulsions (CLC microcapsules) have higher performance scalability than simple CLC droplets. If laser dyes are concentrated at the center of CLC microcapsules, emitted light from the dye is 3D confined. When water is squeezed from the inner phase of a CLC microcapsule comprising an aqueous laser dye solution by means of osmotic pressure difference from the outer phase, the DBR lasing threshold of the CLC microcapsule is reduced. The shrinkage of the inner droplet contributes not only the simple reduction of the cavity length but also the suppression of the optical loss to reduce the lasing threshold. The reduced optical loss is beneficial to realize various devices: optical manipulation, photonic cross communications, and biochemical, light, and temperature sensing.

Specifically, to resolve the obtrusiveness of visual markers, use of infrared (IR) markers that are not visible to the human eye is studied. The main idea is to use an additional external camera with IR functionality to track IR markers that are not detectable in smartphone camera. Additionally is to put a visual fiducial object at the place where the fields of view of the external camera and the smartphone camera are overlapping, which enables the external camera to track the geometric transform between the fiducial object and the IR markers. As a result, since the fiducial object is trackable with the smartphone camera, the smartphone camera pose relative to the IR markers can be computed by using the transform. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a proof-of-concept system is implemented where a visual marker is used as fiducial object for the convenience of implementation. The system accuracy mainly depends on the transform accuracy. Thus, to improve the transform accuracy, two constraints are defined and evaluated: one is that both markers lie on the same plane and the other is that the 3D marker data is available. Through experiments, with the constraints, it is verified that virtual contents can be stably augmented on IR markers in smartphone camera images. © 2016 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015247902

However, the effect of UV signalling on attracting pollinators of particular plant species is still insufficiently studied, especially in the Afrotropics. Therefore, we studied the pollination system of Hypoxis camerooniana in montane grasslands of Mount Cameroon, West/Central Africa. We focused mainly on the effects of the flowers' UV reflectance on its visitors. We experimentally removed UV reflection from petals either completely or partially. Thereafter, flower visitors were recorded and pistils were collected post-flowering to quantify germinated pollen tubes per treatments. The most important visitors were bees, followed by flies. Due to their contacts with reproductive organs bees are considered as the primary pollinators. Visitation rates were lower when UV reflectance was completely removed, whereas the decrease of frequency on half-treated flowers did not differ significantly from control treatments. The complete removal of UV also affected bees' landing behaviour, but not that of flies. We showed that the presence of UV reflectance is more important than UV pattern for bees visiting flowers of H. camerooniana. We hypothesize that exploiting all flowers irrespective of their pattern can be more efficient for pollinators in the open grasslands of high altitudes to spot these relatively scarce flowers by their UV reflectance. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of both experimental and natural controls in similar studies to control for additional effects of the used UV manipulations. Many plants advertise their flowers with UV reflectance visible to their insect visitors. By manipulating the UV reflectance and pattern of Hypoxis camerooniana in the Afromontane grasslands of Mount Cameroon, we have shown how crucial it is for the predominant visitor, bees. Both bees' preferences for flowers and their behaviour during visits are influenced by changes in UV reflectance. However, the presence of some UV signal is more important than the specific pattern. Especially in montane grasslands with higher UV irradiation, the UV floral colours are important for recognition of flowers by potential pollinators. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Previous efforts have focused on deploying mobile service robots for scheduled and periodic tasks such as monitoring, inspecting, and collecting data. Localization and navigation are two of the fundamental capabilities required for any robotic system to accomplish these periodic tasks successfully. Most of the existing approaches for achieving semi/fully autonomous indoor mobile robot navigation either require dense instrumentation of the physical space (e.g., Bluetooth beacons) or are computationally burdensome (e.g., Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). To address these issues, the authors previously developed localization, navigation, and drift correction algorithms based on cost-effective and easily-reconfigurable fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags). However, these algorithms were based on context-specific assumptions regarding the marker characteristics, sensor capabilities, and environmental conditions. This study comprehensively investigates the design characteristics of a fiducial marker network localization system to achieve autonomous mobile indoor navigation. A generalized framework in the form of a process flow chart is proposed that is agnostic of indoor building environment application, marker category, robot, and facility type. That is, the proposed framework can be used to systematically to design the desired robot, required sensors, and create the optimal marker network map. The feasibility of the proposed approach is explained with the help of a facility management related example.

Despite its many benefits, the chief weakness of EPDM has been the color change occurring in its products due to ultraviolet (UV) rays. It is recognized that UV energy causes the dissociation of bonds (mostly C-C and C-H) in EPDM materials as well as cracks and color changes on the surface. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Tinuvin derivatives widely used as UV stabilizers in the plastics industry on EPDM rubber. The EPDM rubber plates were prepared by adding Tinuvin-P, Tinuvin-213 and Tinuvin-234 as UV absorbers (UVAs) and Tinuvin-123 as hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) material at a ratio of 1.0 phr (parts per hundred parts of rubber) to an available EPDM formula. The effects of the Tinuvin derivatives were investigated by the internationally recognized Florida outdoor aging test. The surfaces of the EPDM plates were visually scrutinized and surface morphological changes were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry analyses. The results obtained showed that, unlike in the plastic industry, not all Tinuvin derivatives could be used as UV stabilizers for EPDM products. Of all the tested Tinuvin derivatives, the Tinuvin-123 compound was the most effective, indicating it to be suitable for use as a protective UV stabilizer for EPDM rubber applications. Thus, an important issue such as the UV resistance of sealing profiles made by EPDM rubber has been contributed about the suitability of Tinuvin derivatives. © 2018 Sibel Dikmen Kucuk, Husnu Gerengi, Yusuf Guner.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045648340

For autonomously controlled vehicles driving safely in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios, it is essential to predict the evolution of the current traffic situation in the near future and make an accurate situation risk assessment. The precise motion prediction of surrounding vehicles is an essential prerequisite for risk assessment and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment and motion planning method for autonomously controlled vehicles based on motion prediction of surrounding vehicles. Firstly, surrounding vehicles&#x2019; trajectories are predicted based on fusing constant turn rate and acceleration-based motion prediction model and maneuver-based motion prediction model with interactive multiple models. Then, the collision risk assessment between autonomously controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles is conducted with a collision risk index considering both the probability of collision event and collision severity. After that, the motion planning of autonomously controlled vehicle is formulated as a multi-objectives and multi-constraints optimization problem with model predictive control. Finally, the proposed method is applied to several traffic scenarios to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. CCBY",Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097175607

As the possibilites for new design and fabrication emerge from creatvity and need, the application and use of new robotc technologies becomes vital. This movement has been largely focused on the deployment of industrial-type robots used in the (automobile) manufacturing industry for decades, as well as trying to apply these technologies into off-site building construction. Beyond the pre-fab (off-site) conditions, on-site fabrication offers a valuable next step to implement new construction methods and reduce human work-related injuries. The main challenge in introducing on-site robotc fabrication/construction is the dificulty in calibrating robot navigation (localization) in an unstructured and constantly changing environment. Additionally, advances in robotc technology, similar to the revolution of at-home 3D printing, shift the ownership of modes of production from large industrial enttes to individuals, allowing for greater levels of design and construction customization. This paper demonstrates a low-cost humanoid robot as highly customizable technology for floor tling. A novel end-effector design to pick up tles was developed, along with a localization system that can be applied to a wide variety of robots. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

It is shown that these cholesteric spherical reflectors (CSRs) can encode information onto surfaces for far-field optical read-out without false positives, as the selective retroreflectivity allows the background to be easily subtracted. In order to hide the encoding from detection by the human eye, the retroreflection band is tuned to the near-UV or IR spectra, allowing ubiquitous deployment of CSRs in human-populated environments. This opens diverse application opportunities, for instance, in supporting safe robotic navigation and in augmented reality. A key breakthrough is our ability to permanently embed CSRs in a binder such that undesired scattering and reflections are minimized. This is achieved by realizing CSRs as shells that are polymerized from the liquid crystalline state. The resulting shrinkage around an incompressible fluid deforms the thinnest region of each shell such that it ruptures at a well-defined point. This leaves a single small hole in every CSR that gives access to the interior, allowing complete embedding in the binder with optimized refractive index, minimizing visibility. © 2021 The Authors.

The system consists of two steps for continuously detecting a certain target. To be specific, the first step is to designate a person as a target. In this step, if an object is locate within the certain area of near the vehicle, the system will perceive it as a target. Next step is to calculate the distance and direction between the vehicle and the target. When those information is provided to the tracking system, the vehicle has to follow the object for the purpose of keeping constant distance between them. The vehicle is equipped with two LiDAR sensors located on the front and left side of that, respectively. The function of the former sensor (HOKUYO-UTM30lx) is to find a target located in the front area of the vehicle, and that of the latter one(HOKUYO-URG04lx) is to discover a target located in the left area of that. In order to prove the effectiveness of the system, we conduct several experiments in indoor and outdoor environments. In the case of an indoor experiment, the vehicle detect a certain person as a target, and continuously follow in the place where people are crowded. In outdoor, vehicle platooning is performed by means of the system in three vehicles. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962705711

While the code gives convenience as a physical pointer to the digital world, it can be manipulated to divert the intended destination of the link to a malicious site. Thus, QR codes can be easily exploited by phishers to launch phishing attacks. Here, the current phishing attacks that utilise the QR code as a vector are surveyed and categorised. The recent countermeasures for such attacks are surveyed as well. It is also found that, current countermeasures are insufficient and face challenges like barcode-in-barcode attacks, high overhead solutions and limited data space in the code. In comparison to the amount of work done in web and email phishing detection, QR code phishing detection still inadequate. This paper hopes to shed light on the recent phishing attacks using QR code and the countermeasures proposed to tackle these attacks. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073227566

We train a standard object detector on a small, normally packed dataset with data augmentation techniques. This dataset is 265 times smaller than the standard dataset, in terms of number of annotations. This low data baseline achieves satisfactory results (mAP = 0.56) at standard IoU of 0.5. We also create a varied benchmark for generic SKU product detection by providing full annotations for multiple public datasets. It can be accessed at this URL.
