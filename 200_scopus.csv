This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, before being fully implemented in the national building codes and international standards, the ZEB concept requires clear and consistent definition and a commonly agreed energy calculation methodology. The most important issues that should be given special attention before developing a new ZEB definition are: (1) the metric of the balance, (2) the balancing period, (3) the type of energy use included in the balance, (4) the type of energy balance, (5) the accepted renewable energy supply options, (6) the connection to the energy infrastructure and (7) the requirements for the energy efficiency, the indoor climate and in case of gird connected ZEB for the building-grid interaction.

However, it is a difficult task to find better design alternatives satisfying several conflicting criteria, especially, economical and environmental performance. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model that could assist designers in green building design. Variables in the model include those parameters that are usually determined at the conceptual design stage and that have critical influence on building performance. Life cycle analysis methodology is employed to evaluate design alternatives for both economical and environmental criteria. Life cycle environmental impacts are evaluated in terms of expanded cumulative exergy consumption, which is the sum of exergy consumption due to resource inputs and abatement exergy required to recover the negative impacts due to waste emissions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal solutions. A case study is presented and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for identifying a number of Pareto optimal solutions for green building design. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Innovative technologies and energy efficiency measures are nowadays well known and widely spread, and the main issue is to identify those that will be proven to be the more effective and reliable in the long term. With such a variety of proposed measures, the decision maker has to compensate environmental, energy, financial and social factors in order to reach the best possible solution that will ensure the maximization of the energy efficiency of a building satisfying at the same time the building's final user/occupant/owner needs. This paper investigates the feasibility of the application of multi-objective optimization techniques to the problem of the improvement of the energy efficiency in buildings, so that the maximum possible number of alternative solutions and energy efficiency measures may be considered. It further shows that no optimal solution exists for this problem due to the competitiveness of the involved decision criteria.

Building Energy Simulation and Optimization (BESO) is an emerging innovative technique that shows promise but is not yet a widely adopted design practice. To identify the needs, benefits, and hindrances of applying BESO to sustainable building design, particularly passive design, a two-part survey was conducted. A significant amount of attention was dedicated to analyzing the opinions of early adopters. Out of nine potential hindrances of the BESO technique, long calculation time, lack of adequate advertisement, and lack of a standard method or procedure are in the top three. Based on the survey results, a review was conducted to categorize a general procedure for the BESO technique. The application of the BESO technique to passive building design was investigated. The passive design components covered building forms, opaque envelopes, fenestrations, shadings, natural ventilation, and thermal mass materials. The review concludes that the three-phase optimization method was the most widely used method.

Most of the existing buildings' envelopes have low levels of insulation, high thermal losses due to thermal bridges and cracks, absence of appropriate solar control, etc.Further, in building refurbishment, the importance of a system level approach is often undervalued in favour of simplistic ""off the shelf"" efficient solutions, focused on the reduction of thermal transmittance and on the enhancement of solar control capabilities. In many cases, the importance of the dynamic thermal properties is often neglected or underestimated and the effective thermal capacity is not properly considered as one of the design parameters.The research presented aims to critically assess the influence of the dynamic thermal properties of the building fabric (roof, walls and floors) on sensible heating and cooling energy demand for a case study. The case study chosen is an existing office building which has been retrofitted in recent years and whose energy model has been calibrated according to the data collected in the monitoring process.The research illustrates the variations of the sensible thermal energy demand of the building in different retrofit scenarios, and relates them to the variations of the dynamic thermal properties of the construction components.A parametric simulation study has been performed, encompassing the use of calculation tools and performance metrics at the different scales of the building (envelope-zone-overall building) considering the realistic operating conditions assumed for the initial calibrated model and different climate conditions, typical of the Italian territory and, more in general, of the Southern European and Mediterranean area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923556062

For this reason experimental reference values of the internal areal heat capacity (k1) were introduced. This study aims to understand the interdependency between some thermal parameters (U, Ms, φ, F a, Ymn, k1) of massive and lightweight walls with respect to their energy performance in use in office buildings in Southern Europe. The study has analyzed eight walls with Italian standard U and Y mn values. These walls have been then modified in order to reach k1 values corresponding to the reference ones. The energy demand to ensure a defined level of indoor thermal comfort has been verified with thermodynamic simulations on a virtual test-room localized in two Italian cities, characterized by different climate conditions. The research results are: to develop design change strategies for external walls to achieve the k 1 reference values; to quantify the thermal annual energy demand of a virtual test-room equipped with the sample walls and then equipped with the improved walls; to compare the energetic and economic impact for the improved walls against the sample ones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890121482

This approach allows a move away from the technological intensity of conventional ""smart"" building systems towards a more autonomous and robust materially embedded sensitivity and climatic responsiveness. The actuation mechanisms of natural responsive systems can be replicated to produce artificial moisture-sensitive (hygromorphic) composites with the response driven by hygroexpansion of wood. The work presented here builds on previous research on lab-scale material development, to investigate in detail the applicability of wood-based hygromorphic materials for large-scale external applications. The suitability of different material production techniques and viability of potential applications is established through a detailed programme of experimentation and the first one-year-long durability study of hygromorphic wood composites in full weathering conditions. These results provide the basis for the design of an optimised responsive cladding system. The opportunities and challenges presented by building integration and architectural functionalisation of responsive wood composites are discussed based on a hierarchy of application typologies including functional devices and components, performance-oriented adaptive systems, the value of aesthetic and spatial experience and place-specific contextual integration.

The programming of such systems with increasingly specific response requires a material-driven computational design and fabrication strategy. This research presents techniques and technologies for significantly upscaling hygroscopically actuated timber-based systems for use as self-constructing building surfaces. The timber's integrated hygroscopic characteristics combined with computational design techniques and existing digital fabrication methods allow for a designed processing and reassembly of discrete wood elements into large-scale multi element bilayer surfaces. This material assembly methodology enables the design and control of the encoded direction and magnitude of humidity-actuated responsive curvature at an expanded scale. Design, simulation, and material assembly tests are presented together with formal and functional configurations that incorporate self-constructing and self-rigidizing surface strategies.

This phenomenon is based on frozen strains (FS). They were detected in wood fastened specimens during drying in the early 1960s. The integral law of wood deforming under loading and moisture content and/or temperature changes was subsequently formulated. This law takes into account the forming of FS. It was applied for the calculation of wood drying stresses. Stress memory and strain memory effects for wood were discovered. Wood has the ability to recollect the type of loading (tension or compression) which it had undergone. The difference between the free and restrained shrinkage is named ""frozen shrinkage"" (FSh). In calculations of drying stresses, it is more justified to use the FSh concept than ""mechano-sorptive creep"" (MSC). The MSC phenomenon is observed at cyclical change of moisture content in loaded wood. ""Hygrofatigue"" that reduces wood stiffness plays the main role in this process. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900506802

Thus wood displays significant differentiation in its material makeup and structure as compared to most industrially produced, isotropic materials. Upon closer examination wood can be described as an anisotropic natural fiber system with different material characteristics and related behavior in different directions relative to the main grain orientation. Because of its differentiated internal capillary structure wood is also hygroscopic. It absorbs and releases moisture in exchange with the environment and these fluctuations cause differential dimensional changes. in architectural history the inherent heterogeneity of wood and the related more complex material characteristics have been mainly understood as a major deficiency by the related crafts, timber industry, engineers and architects alike. This paper will present an alternative design approach and associated computational design tools that aim at understanding wood's differentiated material make up as its major capacity rather than a deficiency. Along two design experiments the related research on an integral computational design approach towards unfolding wood's intrinsic material characteristics and performative capacity will be discussed. The first experiment explores the anisotropic characteristics of wood by exploiting the differential bending behavior in relation to the local induction of forces through which a specific overall morphology can be achieved. The second experiment focuses on the hygroscopic property of wood as the base for developing a surface structure that responds to changes in relative humidity with no need for any additional electronic or mechanical control.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955482294
