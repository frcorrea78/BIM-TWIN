The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, for example, CAD models, we automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover, the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering. © 2007 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248995532

While recently developed methods in this domain focus on mere local surface reconstructions which enable e.g. efficient visualization, our approach aims for a volumetric, parametric building model that additionally incorporates contextual information such as global wall connectivity. In contrast to pure surface reconstructions, our representation thereby allows more comprehensive use: first, it enables efficient high-level editing operations in terms of e.g. wall removal or room reshaping which always result in a topologically consistent representation. Second, it enables easy taking of measurements like e.g. determining wall thickness or room areas. These properties render our reconstruction method especially beneficial to architects or engineers for planning renovation or retrofitting. Following the idea of previous approaches, the reconstruction task is cast as a labeling problem which is solved by an energy minimization. This global optimization approach allows for the reconstruction of wall elements shared between rooms while simultaneously maintaining plausible connectivity between all wall elements. An automatic prior segmentation of the point clouds into rooms and outside area filters large-scale outliers and yields priors for the definition of labeling costs for the energy minimization. The reconstructed model is further enriched by detected doors and windows.

However, full realization of these benefits requires specialized functionality, including top-down modeling, objects with functional behavior, the ability to embed contextual design intent, automation of layout and detailing and appropriate management of similar objects.

The RBF exactly describes the range data and interpolates across holes and gaps. The data is smoothed during evaluation of the RBF by simply changing the basic function. The amount of smoothing can be varied as required without having to fit a new RBF to the data. The key feature of our approach is that it avoids resampling the RBF on a fine grid or performing a numerical convolution. Furthermore, the computation required is independent of the extent of the smoothing kernel, i.e., the amount of smoothing. We show that particular smoothing kernels result in the applicability of fast numerical methods. We also discuss an alternative approach in which a discrete approximation to the smoothing kernel achieves similar results by adding new centres to the original RBF during evaluation. This approach allows arbitrary filter kernels, including anisotropic and spatially varying filters, to be applied while also using established fast evaluation methods. We illustrate both techniques with LIDAR laser scan data and noisy synthetic data.

Information from GIS can facilitate BIM applications such as site selection and onsite material layout, while BIM models could help generate detailed models in GIS and achieve better utility management. The mapping between the key schemas in the BIM domain and the GIS domain is the most critical step towards interoperability between the two domains. In this study, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) were chosen as the key schemas due to their wide applications in the BIM domain and the GIS domain, respectively. We used an instance-based method to generate the mapping rules between IFC and CityGML based on the inspection of entities representing the same component in the same model. It ensures accurate mapping between the two schemas. The transformation of coordinate systems and geometry are two major issues addressed in the instance-based method. Considering the difference in schema structure and information richness between the two schemas, a reference ontology called Semantic City Model was developed and an instance-based method was adopted. The Semantic City Model captures all the relevant information from BIM models and GIS models during the mapping process. Since CityGML is defined in five levels of detail (LoD), the harmonization among LoDs in CityGML was also developed in order to complete the mapping. The test results show that the developed framework can achieve automatic data mapping between IFC and CityGML in different LoDs. Furthermore, the developed Semantic City Model is extensible and can be the basis for other schema mappings between the BIM domain and the GIS domain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes a modification of the existing Hough transform for the automatic detection of cylinder parameters in point clouds. Careful analysis reveals that the existing method still has excessive space and time complexity or yields imprecise outcomes. The approach described here modifies the orientation estimation with an area-based adaptive method that utilizes a small accumulator to detect significant peaks in the Hough space in the presence of single or multiple cylinders in the point cloud data. After orientation estimation, the position and radius are estimated using an orthonormal coordinate system with a circle fitting algorithm. These modifications are tested with extensive sets of real point cloud data, and experimental results show that the presented approach minimizes the space and time complexity. After detection, the relationship between cylinders is reconstructed to form a continuous axis network by tracking cylinder parameters obtained from earlier steps. Using the axis network of cylinders obtained from point clouds, models of entire pipelines that include straight pipes, elbow joints, and T-junctions are determinately defined, and output data is reconstructed in Smart Plant 3D (SP3D).

The state-of-the-art methods for fitting primitives, non-uniform B-Spline surface (NURBS) and solid geometry to point clouds still fail to account for all the topological variations or struggle with mapping of physical space to parameter space given unordered, incomplete, and noisy point clouds. Assuming an input of points that can be described by a single non-self-intersecting NURBS, this article presents a new method that leverages segmented point clouds and outputs NURBS surfaces. It starts by successively fitting uniform B-Spline curves in two-dimensional as planar cross-sectional cuts on each surface. An intermediate B-Spline surface is then computed by globally optimizing and lofting over the cross-sections. This surface is used to parameterize the points and perform final refinement to a NURBS. For cylindrical segments such as pipes, a new supervised method is also introduced to string the fitted segments, identify connection types, standardize the connections, and then refine them using NURBS optimization. Experimental results show the applicability of the proposed methods for as-built modeling purposes. © 2016 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955142057

Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system, called SeeBridge, has been proposed. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM) was compiled to specify the technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process, and a Model View Definition (MVD) was prepared to specify the data exchange schema to serve the IDM. The MVD was bound to the IFC4 Add2 data schema standard. The IDM and MVD support research and development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data that structure bridge engineers' knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented, and the future use of the IDM is discussed. The development underlines the real potential for automated inspection of infrastructure at large, because it demonstrates that the hurdles in the way of automated acquisition of detailed and semantically rich models of existing infrastructure are computational in nature, not instrumental, and are surmountable with existing technologies. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042407578

Automating the PCD conversion process can drastically reduce the cost of generating as-built BIMs. Due to the widespread existence of planar structures in civil infrastructures, detecting and extracting planar patches from raw PCDs is a fundamental step in the conversion pipeline from PCDs to BIMs. However, existing methods cannot effectively address both automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from infrastructure PCDs. The existing methods cannot resolve the problem due to the large scale and model complexity of civil infrastructure, or due to the requirements of extra constraints or known information. To address the problem, this article presents a novel framework for automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from large-scale and noisy raw PCDs. The proposed method automatically detects planar structures, estimates the parametric plane models, and determines the boundaries of the planar patches. The first step recovers existing linear dependence relationships amongst points in the PCD by solving a group-sparsity inducing optimization problem. Next, a spectral clustering procedure based on the recovered linear dependence relationships segments the PCD. Then, for each segmented group, model parameters of the extracted planes are estimated via singular value decomposition (SVD) and maximum likelihood estimation sample consensus (MLESAC). Finally, the α-shape algorithm detects the boundaries of planar structures based on a projection of the data to the planar model. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively by experiments on two types of PCDs from real-world infrastructures, one captured directly by laser scanners and the other reconstructed from video using structure-from-motion techniques. To evaluate the performance comprehensively, five evaluation metrics are proposed which measure different aspects of performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, in the sense that the method automatically and accurately extracts planar patches from large-scaled raw PCDs without any extra constraints nor user assistance. © 2014 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920928237

There is a pressing need to automate this process. Previous research has achieved the automatic generation of surface primitives combined with rule-based classification to create labeled cuboids and cylinders from point clouds. Although these methods work well in synthetic data sets or idealized cases, they encounter huge challenges when dealing with real-world bridge point clouds, which are often unevenly distributed and suffer from occlusions. In addition, real bridge geometries are complicated. In this article, we propose a novel top-down method to tackle these challenges for detecting slab, pier, pier cap, and girder components in reinforced concrete bridges. This method uses a slicing algorithm to separate the deck assembly from pier assemblies. It then detects and segments pier caps using their surface normal, and girders using oriented bounding boxes and density histograms. Finally, our method merges oversegments into individually labeled point clusters. The results of 10 real-world bridge point cloud experiments indicate that our method achieves very high detection performance. This is the first method of its kind to achieve robust detection performance for the four component types in reinforced concrete bridges and to directly produce labeled point clusters. Our work provides a solid foundation for future work in generating rich Industry Foundation Classes models from the labeled point clusters. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061350222

The status of this infrastructure needs to be monitored on a continuous basis in order to ensure its safety and functionality. This is currently being done by authorities worldwide via bridge inspection reports. The format and storage of these reports varies considerably across different authorities around the world and is sometimes compiled into a bridge management system (BMS). The lack of standardization severely hinders the use of inspection information for knowledge-generation use cases by both practitioners and researchers. This paper presents an exploratory analysis, and as a result, an information model and a candidate binding to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to categorize inspection information on RC bridges and to standardize storage of this information in a format suitable for sharing and comparing it between different users and varying requirements. The authors were able to show in three steps that IFC in its latest version provides sufficient functionality to serve as a basis for integrating relevant defect information and imagery. First, types of defects and properties needed for bridge assessment were extracted from existing bridge inspection manuals. Second, the authors modeled the defect entities, their properties, and their relationships, and third, mapped them to appropriate IFC entities. A prototypical implementation serves as a proof of concept for automated sharing and comparing of information needed in RC bridge inspections and for establishing a knowledge base for bridge performance over time and across authorities. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042209887

In this work, an automatic and linear-runtime approach is presented which generates the as-built infrastructure component models by recognizing the solid CAD entities and learning the infrastructure component labels from the fitted surface primitives. The algorithm utilizes a decision tree with the following decision variables: the type, parametric model, orientation, and mutual geometric relations of the fitted surface primitives. The decision tree is trained with easily generated synthetic data and is applied to query real-world data with complexity O (1).

First, underlying DfMA criteria for bridge construction are identified and a suitability analysis of precast components based on the identified DfMA criteria identified is conducted via an interview. Second, a case study on a bridge recently built for a highway bridge project is conducted to identify the feasibility of the potential precast components selected from the suitability analysis.

In order to represent sharp edges and vertices, this surface is augmented by adding new types of implicit representations, called edge descriptors and vertex descriptors. They are defined with the help of the distance field of edge curves. In our implementation, we use circular splines to describe these edge curves, since they support a fast and non-iterative closest point computation. After adding the edge and vertex descriptors to the initial scalar field, the zero set of the augmented function contains the sharp features. We apply the new representation to surface modeling by implicitly defined surfaces with sharp features and to object reconstruction. In the latter case we describe an algorithm for detecting the sharp curves and vertices of a shape which is given by an unorganized point cloud, which are then approximated by circular splines, in order to define the edge and vertex descriptors. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

When laser scanners can produce dense point clouds that capture cm-level features in minutes, efficient 3D point cloud processing, storage, and visualization remain challenging due to gigabytes of 3D imagery data. A practical solution is to compress the point cloud while keeping enough geometric information (e.g., edges, corners). Existing compression method uses uniform sampling that reduces data densities everywhere without considering that geometric complexities of different parts of a scene may deserve varying data densities. However, limited studies quantitively assess the deviations between pre- and post-compression point clouds. This research examines a laser-scanning data compression method that enables automatic compression of a point cloud with varying subsampling rates per geometric complexities of parts of data and a user-specified compression ratio (the ratio of the removed point cloud to the original point cloud, the segment with the highest value is the most compressed). Compared with qualitative methods, this method quantifies the relationship between conserved geometric details, subsampling rates, and geometric complexities. First, the developed approach takes segmented point clouds as inputs (either manual or automatic segmentation results) that contain data segments of significantly different geometric complexities depending on the shapes underlying the data segments. Next, surface smoothness and curvature are calculated to quantify the geometric complexities of point cloud segments. Then per total compression ratio, the developed approach assigns various sub-compression ratios to the segments per their geometry complexities (e.g., complicated segments are assigned higher compression ratio to keep more data and vice versa). Finally, this approach evaluates compression results by accessing deviations between the original and compressed point clouds. Results from a case study indicate that the proposed method can achieve a high compression ratio and conserve more information than the uniform sampling approach. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021697975
