This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications.

This requires the acquisition of data from various sources followed by the transformation of these data into an appropriate format. The integration and representation of heterogeneous data in a GIS are very important for use cases involving both BIM and GIS data, such as in the management of municipal facilities. We propose a BIM/GIS-based information Extract, Transform, and Load (BG-ETL) architecture that separates geometrical information from that related to the relevant properties. The property required for each use-case perspective is extracted and transformed from information for the BIM with FM to GIS using the ETL concept. In consideration of the viewpoint of geometry, the surface model for several representations in the GIS, we designed BG-ETL, developed a prototype, and verified the results through interviews. The results show that BG-ETL considering BIM/GIS integration issue has benefits such as reusability and extensibility. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. Elsevier B.V.

The resulting networks of interacting EDTs model different application scenarios and are simulated in virtual testbeds, providing new foundations for comprehensive simulation-based systems engineering. Its focus is on EDTs, which become more detailed with every single application. Thus, complete digital representations of the respective real assets and their behaviors are created successively.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges.

We consolidate various algorithms proposed for reconstructing 3-D models of urban objects from point clouds. Urban models addressed in this review include buildings, vegetation, utilities such as roads or power lines and free-form architectures such as curved buildings or statues, all of which are ubiquitous in a typical urban scenario. While urban modeling, building reconstruction, in particular, clearly demand specific traits in the models, such as regularity, symmetry, and repetition; most of the traditional and state-of-the-art 3-D reconstruction algorithms are designed to address very generic objects of arbitrary shapes and topology. The recent efforts in the urban reconstruction arena, however, strive to accommodate the various pressing needs of urban modeling. Strategically, urban modeling research nowadays focuses on the usage of specialized priors, such as global regularity, Manhattan-geometry or symmetry to aid the reconstruction, or efficient adaptation of existing reconstruction techniques to the urban modeling pipeline. Aimed at an in-depth exploration of further possibilities, we review the existing urban reconstruction algorithms, prevalent in computer graphics, computer vision and photogrammetry disciplines, evaluate their performance in the architectural modeling context, and discuss the adaptability of generic mesh reconstruction techniques to the urban modeling pipeline.

Various projects have been carried out successfully during the last years and demonstrated the power behind the overall concept - and the practical problems to reach the ambitious overall goals. Whereas the first steps of MBSE like the iterative modeling of requirements, designs, behaviors, and tests became standard procedures in Systems Engineering (SE), the transition to simulation often is still restricted to quite simple scenarios. Although elaborated system models deliver all the information needed, the simulation of the overall system in prospective working environments interacting with other systems is rather an exception. The problem is that there is still quite a gap between the first SE steps and the various algorithms simulation technology can offer today. Major reasons for this seem to be the resulting complexity of the system model when modeling complex interactions, the complexity of using state-of-the-art simulation technology and the absence of simulation frameworks for simulations across multiple domains and disciplines. ""Experimentable Digital Twins"", a concept originally developed for the eRobotics methodology, seem to have the potential to close the gap between SE and simulation by introducing a new structuring element to configure simulations.

The Ontario BMS integrates the deterioration model, cost model, and business rules for treatment selection and costing, and an analytical framework for calculating and representing information relevant to the decision at hand. The Quebec BMS has three main models (Deterioration Model, Treatment Model, and Cost Model) that are used to create work alternatives at the element, project, and program levels.
