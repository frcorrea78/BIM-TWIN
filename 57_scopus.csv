In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications. The classified inventory could be useful for scientists as well as stakeholders in the geospatial industry, such as companies and national mapping agencies, as it may serve as a reference document to better position their operations, design product portfolios, and to better understand the market. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952802912

In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model.

This requires the acquisition of data from various sources followed by the transformation of these data into an appropriate format. The integration and representation of heterogeneous data in a GIS are very important for use cases involving both BIM and GIS data, such as in the management of municipal facilities. We propose a BIM/GIS-based information Extract, Transform, and Load (BG-ETL) architecture that separates geometrical information from that related to the relevant properties. The property required for each use-case perspective is extracted and transformed from information for the BIM with FM to GIS using the ETL concept. In consideration of the viewpoint of geometry, the surface model for several representations in the GIS, we designed BG-ETL, developed a prototype, and verified the results through interviews.

The insufficiencies caused by existing navigation approaches can be overcome by making use of the advanced semantic and geometric information included in intelligent building models. A key example of such models is Building Information Models (BIMs) which contain detailed geometric and semantic information about buildings. In fact, the BIMs' structure is very complex for facilitating navigation. This paper presents a new BIM Oriented Modeling methodology resulting in the definition of a new BIM based model (BO-IDM) dedicated for facilitating indoor navigation. The paper later describes the transformation of information from a standard BIM (IFC) into the new model (BO-IDM). The innovation aspects of BO-IDM can be summarized as follows: (i) it provides highly detailed semantic information for indoor navigation and (ii) it represents the non-geo-referenced structure and complex geometries of BIMs with ISO 19107 compliant representations.

Information from GIS can facilitate BIM applications such as site selection and onsite material layout, while BIM models could help generate detailed models in GIS and achieve better utility management. The mapping between the key schemas in the BIM domain and the GIS domain is the most critical step towards interoperability between the two domains. In this study, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) were chosen as the key schemas due to their wide applications in the BIM domain and the GIS domain, respectively. We used an instance-based method to generate the mapping rules between IFC and CityGML based on the inspection of entities representing the same component in the same model. It ensures accurate mapping between the two schemas. The transformation of coordinate systems and geometry are two major issues addressed in the instance-based method. Considering the difference in schema structure and information richness between the two schemas, a reference ontology called Semantic City Model was developed and an instance-based method was adopted. The Semantic City Model captures all the relevant information from BIM models and GIS models during the mapping process. Since CityGML is defined in five levels of detail (LoD), the harmonization among LoDs in CityGML was also developed in order to complete the mapping. The test results show that the developed framework can achieve automatic data mapping between IFC and CityGML in different LoDs. Furthermore, the developed Semantic City Model is extensible and can be the basis for other schema mappings between the BIM domain and the GIS domain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a key element of this integrated geospatial information to emerge is detailed geometrical and semantic information about buildings. In parallel, Building Information Models (BIMs) of today have the capacity for storing and representing such detailed geometrical and semantic information. In this context, the research aimed to investigate the applicability of BIMs in geospatial environment by focusing specifically on these two domains; site selection and fire response management. In the first phase of the research two use case scenarios were developed in order to understand the processes in these domains in a more detailed manner and to establish the scope of a possible software development for transferring information from BIMs into the geospatial environment. In the following phase of the research two data models were developed - a Schema-Level Model View and a geospatial data model. The Schema-Level Model View was used in simplifying the information acquired from the BIM, while the geospatial data model acted as the template for creating physical files and databases in the geospatial environment. Following this, three software components to transfer building information into the geospatial environment were designed, developed, and validated. The first component served for acquiring the building information from the BIM, while the latter two served for transforming the information into the geospatial environment. The overall research demonstrated that it is possible to transfer (high level of geometric and semantic) information acquired from BIMs into the geospatial environment. The results also demonstrated that BIMs provide a sufficient level and amount of (geometric and semantic) information (about the building) for the seamless automation of data management tasks in the site selection and fire response management processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Occasionally tower cranes operate with overlapping work zones and often under time, cost and labor constraints. Identifying optimal number and location of tower cranes is an important issue that can reduce conflicts between groups of tower cranes. Geographic information systems (GIS) facilitate the analysis of large amounts of spatial data used in the process of location optimization for tower cranes. In addition, integrating analysis results from GIS with 3D visual models enables managers to visualize the potential conflicts with tower cranes in great detail. Building Information Modeling (BIM) helps managers to visualize buildings before implementation takes place through a digitally constructed virtual model. Hence, in this paper, the integrated GIS-BIM model starts with the identification of feasible locations for defined tower cranes. The method presented is based on previous works using ""geometric closeness"" and coverage of all demand and supply points as key criteria for locating a group of tower cranes*). Once the geometry of the construction site is generated by the BIM tool, the model determines the proper combination of tower cranes in order to optimize location. The output of the GIS model includes one or more feasible areas that cover all demand and supply points, which is then linked to the BIM tool and generates 3D models to visualize the optimum location of tower cranes. As a result, potential conflicts are detected in different 3D views in order to identify optimal location of tower cranes. To address the feasibility of a GIS-BIM integrated model for layout of tower cranes, an actual case example is introduced. COPYRIGHT: © 2012 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867859668

Contrary to outdoor environments, first responders and planners have limited information regarding the indoor areas in terms of architectural and semantic information as well as how they interact with their surroundings in case of indoor disasters. Availability of such information could help decision makers interact with building information and thus make more efficient planning prior to entering the disaster site. In addition as the indoor travel times required to reach specific areas in the building could be much longer compared to outdoor, visualizing the exact location of building rooms and utilities in 3D helps in visually communicating the indoor spatial information which could eventually result in decreased routing uncertainty inside the structures and help in more informed navigation strategies. This work aims at overcoming the insufficiencies of existing indoor modelling approaches by proposing a new Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) based on IFC. The model integrates 3D indoor architectural and semantic information required by first responders during indoor disasters with outdoor geographical information to improve situational awareness about both interiors of buildings as well as their interactions with outdoor components.

Although many geometric models have been developed in both domains, the number of semantic models is relatively few. Two most prominent semantic models in the design and real worlds are currently IFC and CityGML.

Several studies have used the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) model to generate indoor network models. These models are subject to the input data types, and the attributes of interior building objects are usually incomplete; hence, the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) can benefit indoor-outdoor integrated applications. To achieve data interoperability, an open BIM standard called Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is maintained by buildingSMART. In this study, we propose a multi-purpose geometric network model (MGNM) based on BIM and explore the strategy of indoor and outdoor network connections. To achieve the goals, the IFC-to-MGNM conversion includes the following: (1) extraction of building information from IFC, (2) isolation of the MGNM information from the aforementioned building information, and (3) build up the topological relationships of MGNM into GIS Geodatabase. In addition, an entrance-to-street strategy is proposed to connect indoor networks, entrances, and outdoor networks for detailed route planning. The experimental results indicate that the MGNM could be generated from BIM automatically and applied to connect indoor and outdoor features for the multi-purpose application. Two use-case scenarios were developed to validate the proposed methods. Compared to actual distance, the relative error was improved by 5.1% and 65.5% in the horizontal and vertical routes, respectively, over the conventional indoor network model from 2D ground plan. In addition, the computational time taken by the proposed coarse-to-fine route planning method was 25% that of the traditional single-scale route planning method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The integration of BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and preconstruction stages.

In this article we investigate an alternative to obtaining CityGML LOD3 models: the automatic conversion from already existing architectural models (stored in the IFC format). Existing conversion algorithms mostly focus on the semantic mappings and convert all the geometries, which yields CityGML models having poor usability in practice (spatial analysis, for instance, is not possible). We present a conversion algorithm that accurately applies the correct semantics from IFC models and that constructs valid CityGML LOD3 buildings by performing a series of geometric operations in 3D.

This paper presents the general principles of autonomy and the proposed concepts, methods and technologies to realize cognitive planning, cognitive control and cognitive operation of production systems. Starting with an introduction on the historical context of different paradigms of production (e.g., evolution of production and planning systems), different approaches for the design, planning, and operation of production systems are lined out and future trends towards fully autonomous components of an production system as well as autonomous parts and products are discussed.

Such shortcomings may result in incomplete and uncertain outcomes. Considering the benefits and increasing use of three-dimensional (3D) urban modeling and Building Information Model in various urban management processes, in this paper, an integrated framework for utilization of detailed 3D building models for the assessment and 3D visualization of flood damage to building according to its distinct behavior against flood is presented. A proof-of-concept demonstration of the framework in a case study underlined the feasibility of implementation of the framework, which can potentially benefit a variety of users and be used as a complementary approach to the current FDA methods for improving the resilience of the community toward floods and their adverse impacts. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928380714

The main challenge in BIM and GIS integrated application comes from the fundamental data conversion, especially for the geometric information. BIM and GIS use di?erent modeling paradigms to represent objects. The BIM dataset takes, for example, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) that use solid models, such as boundary representation(B-Rep), swept solid, constructive solid geometry(CSG), and clipping, while the GIS data set mainly uses surface model sor B-Rep. The fundamental data conversion between BIM and GIS is the foundation of BIM and GIS integrated application. However, the efficiency of data conversion has been greatly impaired by the human intervention needed, especially for the conversion of the clipping geometry. The goal of this study is to automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shape file format. A process-level approach was developed with an algorithm for instantiating unbounded half spaces using B-Rep. Four IFC models were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that (1) the proposed approach can successfully automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shapefile format; and (2) increasing boundary size has no effect on the file size of unbounded half spaces, but slightly increases the producing time of half spaces and processing time of building components. The efficiency of this study can be further improved by using an open-source package, instead of using the low-efficiency packages provided by ArcGIS. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082723633

Noise mapping can help evaluating the noise level for certain areas in a city. Traditionally, noise mapping is performed in 2D geographic information system (GIS). The use of 3D GIS is also emerging in noise mapping in recent years. However, the current noise-mapping platforms can only conduct noise evaluation for the outdoor environment and the indoor environment separately. In addition, related information about absorption coefficient and transmission loss (TL) in noise calculation is not properly retrieved and is often replaced with a single value. In this research, building information modelling (BIM) and 3D GIS are integrated in order to combine traffic noise evaluation in both outdoor environments and indoor environments in a single platform. In our developed BIM–GIS integration platform, the built environment is represented in a 3D GIS model that contains information at a high level of detail from BIM. With the integration with BIM, the 3D GIS model now has access to detailed indoor features such as interior walls and interior rooms. Noise evaluation could therefore be performed at a room level in the developed platform. Essential parameters such as absorption coefficient and TL can be extracted directly from BIM for noise calculation. The 3D GIS model is connected with detailed BIM so that any changes in the indoor and outdoor features can be reflected to each other. The Italian C.N.R model is modified and applied in the platform to conduct noise calculation.

However, coverage of the theory of BIM diffusion (which combines contextual and technical issues of the applications) remains scant and underdeveloped. Compatibility is one of the key contextual factors of Diffusion of Innovation theory that involves predicting BIM adopters' behaviours and identifying what components require extra effort for successful BIM implementation. However, this important theoretical concept has not been developed in pertinent BIM literature nor used correctly to extend existing knowledge because compatibility variables are not understood in a construction context. This seriously impedes the correct usage of BIM in construction. This study systematically and critically reviews BIM compatibility (BIM-COM) literature to distinguish compatibility issues at the organisational level and the concept of interoperability at the technical level. A sample of 57 out of the 131 articles constituted secondary data and each paper represented the unit of analysis. Bibliographic analysis techniques were used to identify co-authoring network and contents' concentration in the created bibliography. Content analysis and text mining approaches were employed using a thematic clustering analysis for grouping authors and themes within articles. The findings illustrate that the concept of compatibility is surprisingly poorly understood and often overlooked in the literature. The paper argues that interoperability issues prevail as the key practical barrier to BIM implementation. The paper identifies a large knowledge gap in terms of improving compatibility measures, which should be employed by innovators to assess their BIM applications before they offer it to construction companies.

Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain. The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the process while still providing accurate results.

In this research, we enhance mapping work productivity by developing a method that automates LOD geometry mapping using Screen-Buffer scanning-based Multiprocessing (SB-MP) including semantic mapping rule. The proposed method can dramatically improve LOD geometry modeling productivity. Finally, the developed results are evaluated quantitatively. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021937204

However, processing such unstructured point clouds is very challenging, epitomized by high cost, movable objects, limited object classes, and high information inadequacy/redundancy. We noticed that many city objects are not in random shapes; rather, they have invariant cross-sections following the Gestalt design principles, including proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and similarity. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised method, called Clustering Of Symmetric Cross-sections of Objects (COSCO), to process urban LiDAR point clouds to a hierarchy of objects based on their characteristic cross-sections. First, city objects are segmented as connected patches of proximate 3D points. Then, symmetric cross-sections are detected for symmetric city objects. Finally, the taxonomy and groups of city objects are recognized from a hierarchical clustering analysis of the dissimilarity matrix. Experimental results showed that COSCO detected the correct taxonomy and types of 12 cars from 24,126 LiDAR points in 8.28 s. Based on the cross-sections and taxonomy, a digital twin was created by registering online free 3D car models in 29.58 s. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an effective unsupervised method for understanding and developing DTC objects in LiDAR point clouds by harnessing innate Gestalt design principles. Secondly, COSCO can be an efficient LiDAR pre-processing tool for recognizing symmetric city objects’ cross-sections, positions, heading directions, dimensions, and possible types for smart city applications in GIScience, Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO), and autonomous vehicles. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, a point of contention in this integration has yet to be resolved. In view of the shortcomings of the network transmission and browser rendering of current integrated BIM-GIS schemes, accordingly the 3D Tiles data format using Web Graphics Library (WebGL) as the standard for rendering 3D models has been widely considered in recent years. This study provides an implementation plan for data integration and information interaction between BIM and GIS. It aims to improve the traditional model simplification processing solution, analyze the current insufficient network transmission and browser rendering ability of the BIM and GIS integration scheme, and transform the BIM model from the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) into the 3D Tiles data format. In this study, IFC standard files are first exported as the data source, and the mapping relationship between BIM files and 3D Tiles files is analyzed. The integral IFC model is then reorganized to form JSON files associated with semantic attributes and building component models with geometric information. The proposed relationship mapping allows the attribute contained in the IFC models to be delivered to 3D tiles. Meanwhile, the coordinate transformation, data mapping, spatial index, and Level of Details (LOD) hierarchical division are completed during conversion to ensure fast and efficient rendering interaction of BIM data and geographical features in the 3D WebGIS framework.

As the importance of information interchange has been recognized, several authors have tried to develop intermediate models for the information exchange between IFC/BIM and CityGML, e.g., the Unified Building Model (UBM), the BIM Oriented Indoor data Model (BO-IDM), the Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) and the BIM-GIS integration model for Flood Damage Assessment (FDA model).

The integration of information from both domains requires high expertise in both spheres. The existing B.Sc and M.Sc. programs linked to the built environment at the Technical University of Munich offer courses for the Building Information Model (BIM) and GIS that are distributed among study programs in Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Geomatics. Students graduating as professionals in one of these domains rarely know how to solve pre-defined technical problems associated with the integration of information from BIMand GIS. Students in such programs seldom practice skills needed for the integration of information from BIM and GIS at a level that is needed in working life. Conversely, the technologies in both domains create artificial boundaries that do not exist in reality-for example, water and electricity would not be of use if the utilities terminated in front of buildings.

Building information modelling (BIM), which allows for rich representation of building properties, creates an opportunity to conduct value analysis automatically. To support automated value analysis, there is a need to identify and extract value-specific design information (i.e. relevant and sufficient information for value analysis) from a BIM model and utilize this information to enable value analysis. To address this need, this paper proposes a method for value-focused modelling and extraction of design information from an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based BIM model. The method includes two primary elements: (1) extending the IFC schema to include the additional entities and property sets that are needed to represent the necessary information for conducting value analysis; and (2) extracting the target design information from an IFC-based BIM instance model. The information extraction method was tested in extracting target design information from two BIM models. A 100% precision and recall was achieved, which indicates that all and only the necessary information was extracted.

For GIS, BIM is a promising source of three-dimensional (3D) building information that can be used in the study of smart city, green building, big data, etc. The underlying data transformation from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile enables GIS to use the rich building information. However, this transformation is difficult due to the different modelling methods used by IFC and shapefile. IFC generally represents 3D objects using boundary representation (Brep), swept solid, constructive solid geometry (CSG), clipping and mapped representation, while shapefile only uses Brep. In addition, the use of different coordinate systems also contributes to the geometry transformation issue. Among all the solid modelling methods used by IFC, Brep and swept solid are the most often used two methods. Compared with Brep, the transformation of swept solid is more challenging as each type of profile for swept solid defined in IFC has to be properly interpreted and converted. This paper develops algorithms to interpret the commonly used profiles of swept solid for the transformation of IFC into shapefile. A bridge model is used to validate the proposed method, and a Web GIS-based bridge management system is developed to demonstrate a possible usage of the transformed shapefile model. © 2020 The Author(s).

Owing to the complexity of 3D geometry, applications with 3D data (e.g. indoor navigation) require an adequate level of detail (LoD) to achieve their purpose. To supply the 3D data demanded by clients, a customised simplification that considers LoDs in an indoor space is required. Most research studies on the simplification of 3D objects, however, have focused on general 3D objects or the exterior of buildings. Applying such approaches to indoor space objects is inefficient and may cause loss of important information because cells in an indoor space have distinctive characteristics compared to general 3D objects. For instance, a conventional room is surrounded by vertically aligned walls and a horizontally aligned ceiling and floor. For this reason, we propose a dedicated simplification method of 3D geometric objects in an indoor space. Our method takes full advantage of the prism model, which is an alternative 3D geometric model that supports prismatic shapes motivated by traits of indoor spaces. Additionally, an approach for dealing with potential topological inconsistencies during simplification is presented in this paper.

Here, the concept of a Digital Twin – which is rapidly emerging throughout many disciplines due to advances in technology, computational capacities and availability of large amounts of data – plays an important role. In short, a digital twin is a living virtual model, a connected digital representation of a physical system and has been a central concept in the manufacturing industry for the past decades. In this article, we review the terminology of digital twins for cities and identify commonalities and relations to the more established term 3D city models. Our fi ndings indicate an increasing use of the term digital twin in academic literature, both in general and in the context of cities and the built environment. We fi nd that while there is as yet no consensus on the exact defi nition of what constitutes a digital twin, it is increasingly being used to describe something that is more than a 3D city model (including, e.g. semantic data, real-time sensor data, physical models, and simulations). At the same time, the term has not yet replaced the term 3D city model as the most dominant term in the 3D GIS domain. By looking at grey literature we discuss how digital twins for cities are implemented in practice and present examples of digital twins in a global perspective. Further, we discuss some of the application areas and potential challenges for future development and implementation of digital twins for cities.

Many studies have argued that the volume of BIM keeps increasing and becomes extremely large as projects proceed. However, processing large-scale BIM data in parallel is still an open issue due to the complicated reference relationships in a BIM. This study addresses this issue by introducing graph theory. Firstly, a novel directed reference graph (DrGraph) model is proposed to capture the reference relationships among BIM instances according to the Industrial Foundation Classes (IFC) specification. On top of DrGraph, BIM product slice (ProSlice) model is developed to split the original IFC file into small independent IFC slices in product level. Since the generated slices are independent of each other, they can be dispatched and computed in a parallel computing cluster. The usage of ProSlice in MapReduce is illustrated using the BIM triangulation task. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed product-level parallel computing scheme has a better performance in both computation efficiency and internal memory usage than floor-level ones, and that parallel computing scales the computation of BIM data. Our product-level parallel computing scheme can also envision other geometric data processing and semantic data analysis of large-scale BIM data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075777900

When dynamic phenomena in 3D cities are represented with a CityGML application domain extension (ADE), the objects in CityGML are often used as static background, and it is difficult to represent the evolutionary process of the objects themselves. Although a construction process model in building information modeling (BIM) is available, it cannot efficiently and accurately simulate the building construction process at the city level. Accordingly, employing the arrow diagramming method, we developed a CityGML ADE to represent this process. We extended the hierarchy of the model and proposed the process levels of detail model. Subsequently, we explored a mechanism to associate the construction process and building objects as well as the mechanism to automate construction process transitions. Experiments indicated that the building construction process ADE (BCPADE) could adequately express the characteristics of this process. Compared with the building construction process model in the architecture, engineering, and construction field, BCPADE removes redundant information, i.e., that unrelated to a 3D city. It can adequately express building construction processes at multiple spatiotemporal scales and accurately convey building object behavior during building evolution, such as adding, removal, merging, and change. Such characteristics enable BCPADE to render efficient and accurate simulations of the building construction process at the city level. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076705803
