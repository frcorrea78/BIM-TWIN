The author gives 4 reasons for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as in anthropology and primatology.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909358155

The result is an understanding of organizing and its conditions and consequences that is necessarily limited. I then argue for an alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life. I draw on some empirical examples to help ground and illustrate this approach in practice and conclude by suggesting that a reconfiguration of our conventional assumptions and considerations of materiality will help us more effectively recognize and understand the multiple, emergent, and shifting sociomaterial assemblages entailed in contemporary organizing.

It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project.

Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research problems that address how to apply socio-technical approaches in a cost-effective way, and how to facilitate the integration of STSE with existing systems and software engineering approaches. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the culture and structure provided few incentives or norms for cooperating or sharing expertise, hence the groupware on its own was unlikely to engender collaboration.

Recently, systemic modeling research into the behavior of large projects explains project overspends by ""systemic"" effects and the (sometimes counterintuitive) effect of management actions. However, while this work is becoming more widely known, embedding the lessons in project-management practice is not straightforward. The current prescriptive dominant discourse of project management contains implicit underlying assumptions with which the systemic modeling work clashes, indeed showing how conventional methods can exacerbate rather than alleviate project problems. Exploration of t his modeling suggests that for projects that are complex, uncertain, and time-limited, conventional methods might be inappropriate, and aspects of newer methodologies in which the project ""emerges"" rather than being fully preplanned might be more appropriate. Some of the current literature on project-classification schemes also suggests similar parameters, without the rationale that the systemic modeling provides, thus providing useful backup to this analysis.

Historically, the industry has focused extensively on optimizing the project management processes associated with the former element. In this focus, organizations have emphasized the ability to develop the optimum plan, allocate resources efficiently, and utilize control functions to ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget. Although this has been effective, this engineering focus has reached the point of diminishing results. Specifically, the engineering approach to project management has neglected to recognize the importance of the participants to the success of the overall project. Rather, the engineering approach has favored the development of an optimum plan as the path to effective project management. In this paper, the engineering-based approach to project success is reconfigured to reemphasize the need to develop high performing teams by recognizing the importance of the project network.

The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged.

Our contention is that this approach to operations management rests on an implicit assumption of the plausibility of a particular theory of the nature of on-going, purposeful activity, the planning model of activity, which we describe in detail in order to draw out its underlying assumptions. We present three examples of the management-as-planning approach from the diverse settings of robotics, manufacturing production management and public sector policy formation and conclude that many of the assumptions of the planning model of activity cannot be satisfied in realistic environments. There is a need to found management at the operations level on a more realistic conception of the nature of purposeful activity which is currently being articulated in the fields of cognitive science and social theory. This change of view leads to a new approach to the nature operations management which we call management-as-organizing. The beginnings of this new approach at work can be discerned in three examples of counter approaches in use in the same three areas studied.

Often when ICT based communication is discussed and managed in construction it often only comprises the technical aspects of information handling, such as modelling, classification and standardization. This paper introduces the subject field of Project Communication, which considers the improvement of organization, group processes, work procedures, as well as the sharing and transfer of knowledge between different professional domains in projects and corporations. The subject area has a special focus on the concept of the integration of project organizations and the creation of an effective platform for collaboration through shared ICT business tools. One prioritized field of research in this area is the problematic issue of creating true usefulness, user acceptance and organizational adoption of ICT in project team work. The paper describes four indicative feasibility studies in Project Communication in the Swedish construction sector.

In order to investigate this view, we carried out experiments examining the effect and significance of different communication channels in collaborative sessions between architects. The experiments were conducted in different environments and classified into three categories. The first category is FTF. The second, CMCD sessions with full communication channels, CMCD-a. The third category was conducted also through CMCD sessions but with limited communication channels, CMCD-b. A custom coding scheme is developed using data, external and theoretically derived coding categories as a base. Examples of how the proposed coding scheme works are given from all three categories of experiments.

We operationalize a definition of ""messy talk"" as a process in which teams mutually discover issues, critically engage in clarifying and finding solutions to the discovered issues, exchange their knowledge, and resolve the issue. Can globally distributed teams use messy talk via virtual communication technology? We analyzed the interactions of four distributed student teams collaborating on a complex design and planning project using building information models (BIMs) and the cyber-enabled global research infrastructure for design (CyberGRID), a virtual world specifically developed for collaborative work. Their interactions exhibited all four elements of messy talk, even though resolution was the least common. Virtual worlds support real-time joint problem solving by (1) providing affordances for talk mediated by shared visualizations, (2) supporting team perceptions of building information models that are mutable, and (3) allowing transformations of those models while people were together in real time.

Empirical data on design communication provide the basis for protocol studies on three project forums from a website for social product design. Mechanisms were identified which describe ways in which collective innovation produces successful solutions shaped by community input: (1) structuring design as a hybrid process, which combines online communities for design development and appointed experts or inbuilt system features for technical and organisational aspects; (2) providing distinct roles for users to assume and manageable tasks for them to perform; (3) clarifying task requirements; and (4) supporting social communication to strengthen the impact of ideas, with particular focus on the social processes of ideation and evaluation.

This paper argues that in order to realize such improvements the modelling/drafting role computers have been assigned in architectural design should be changed, so that computers will become intelligent assistants to designers, relieving them from the need to perform the more trivial design tasks and augmenting their decision making capabilities. To support this argument, architectural design is modelled as a search process in a space of alternative solutions, seeking one or more solutions that satisfy certain design criteria. Design is shown to be a special case of general problem-solving processes, and thus comprised of two major components: design states and the generator/test cycle that facilitates transitions between them. It is then shown that the symbolic representation capabilities of computers qualify them to simulate such design states and the generate/test cycle, using techniques that were developed independently in the fields of geometric modelling and artificial intelligence. A conceptual framework of a knowledge-based computer-aided design system, which brings these techniques to bear on architectural problems, is presented, and its potential for increasing the utility of computers in the design of buildings is discussed. © 1985.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022130724

The planning and coordination of such BIM processes is one of the many important tasks of a BIM manager. It defines which tasks are to be executed by which persons in what order. In particular, the individual interfaces must be clearly specified. A lean and transparent process definition helps support the introduction of BIM methods significantly. This chapter provides an introduction to formal process modeling, including the modeling languages Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF) and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which are widely used today in the field of BIM process modeling. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

Computer Integrated Construction (CIC) is, after decades of work, still a goal to be achieved. Mainstream methods to achieve this goal were the product and later the process models. Recently the attention has shifted towards workflow oriented approaches. In this paper the author will argue that in particular the communication based workflow (as opposed to activity based workflow) could be a promising approach to CIC research. Communication workflow paradigm can be used to scientifically address and examine the most propulsive modern information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile communication and the future integration of the two. An ontological framework is proposed that unifies communication workflow paradigm with more traditional product and process based paradigms. © 2004 ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849161756
