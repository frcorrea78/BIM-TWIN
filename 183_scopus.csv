Digital twins facilitate the means to monitor, understand, and optimize the functions of all physical entities and for humans provide continuous feedback to improve quality of life and well-being. © 1994-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051272175

One way of achieving this is by having smart virtual counterparts to represent the users in the virtual learning environment. We propose that mobile agent technology is aptly suited for providing such smart virtual counterparts to represent learners, teachers and institutions in the virtual learning community. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048891030
