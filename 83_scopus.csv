This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation. © 2014 The Authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919389514

However, critics claim that it means many different things to different people. This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept. © 2017 The Author(s)",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029397642

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

Although several showcases of 3D printed concrete structures are available worldwide, many challenges remain at the technical and processing level. Currently available high-performance cement-based materials cannot be directly 3D printed, because of inadequate rheological and stiffening properties. Active rheology control (ARC) and active stiffening control (ASC) will provide new ways of extending the material palette for 3D printing applications. From an economic point of view, digitally manufactured concrete (DFC) will induce changes in the stakeholders as well as in the cost structure. Although it is currently too ambitious to quantitatively present the cost structure, DFC presents many potential opportunities to increase cost-effectiveness of construction processes. The environmental impact of 3D printing with concrete has to be seen in relation to the shape complexity of the structure. Implementing structural optimization as well as functional hybridization as design strategies allows the use of material only where is structurally or functionally needed. This design optimization increases shape complexity, but also reduces material use in DFC. As a result, it is expected that for structures with the same functionality, DFC will environmentally perform better over the entire service life in comparison with conventionally produced concrete structures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051054239

Sustainable development is even more urgent in the light of global climate change. This paper aims to examine the contributions which building information modelling (BIM) can make to the production of sustainable building designs. Design/methodology/approach: Various research methodologies have been adopted, including literature review, design tool analysis, a case study and structured face-to-face interviews. Data collected were synthesized as part of the research process. Findings: BIM is found to be ideally suited to the delivery of information needed for improved design and building performance. Two most significant benefits of BIM for sustainable building design are: integrated project delivery (IPD) and design optimization. However, there are also barriers to adopting BIM for sustainable design. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not attempt to address all aspects of BIM functionality because the scope of BIM is very great and the resources of this research were limited. Practical implications: Successful implementation of BIM is able to eliminate the extra cost of design changes during the subsequent phases of construction process. BIM, therefore, is also capable of enhancing the project delivery culture in future. Social implications: BIM solutions can contribute to the selection of best solutions to reduce energy and resources consumption. This new technology and the approach also can generate the need of more innovative professionals and job opportunities.

The 3D printing technologies, comparing to traditional techniques of constructing the buildings, could be considered as environmental friendly derivative giving almost unlimited possibilities for geometric complexity realizations. Two kinds of technologies were described in this paper with pointing to Contour Crafting as a promising technique that may be able to revolutionize construction industry in near future. Numerous advantages of this technology, such as reduction of the costs and time, minimizing the pollution of environment and decrease of injuries and fatalities on construction sites could be cited. Despite many advantages and hopes, some concerns are summarized in the conclusions, as the technology still has many limitations. A brief description of few examples of pioneering usage of 3D printing in construction industry are presented (Canal House in Amsterdam, WinSun company and printing application for building carried out by Skanska company). Creating a model that will be appropriate for 3D printers is possible in many different modelling programs. One of the most popular formats for sharing such models is STL format.

This study focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and analytics, and identifies eight specific functionalities enabled by such technologies (improving product design, attracting target customers, monitoring and tracking product activity, providing technical support, providing preventive and predictive maintenance, optimizing the product usage, upgrading the product, enhancing renovation and end-of-life activities). By investigating how these functionalities affect three CE value drivers (increasing resource efficiency, extending lifespan, and closing the loop), the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances knowledge about the role of digital technologies as an enabler of the CE within usage-focused business models.

Moreover, cities have to become or remain livable for their inhabitants and offer social and economic opportunities. Thus, reconnecting food production and cities offers promising potential. The diffusion of urban farming reflects a rising awareness of how food and farming can shape our cities. A growing number of urban farming projects exist in and on urban buildings, including open rooftop farms, rooftop greenhouses and indoor farming. These projects are characterized by the non-use of land or acreage for farming activities. We use the term 'Zero-Acreage Farming' (ZFarming) to represent these farms.

It aims to innovate the entire chain of production, consumption, distribution and recovery of materials and energy according to a cradle to cradle vision. The awareness of increasing constraints on the availability of resources as well as the increasing demand for access to welfare and wellbeing by developing countries and social groups make it evident the need for new economic models capable to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use. In the last two decades a growing literature addressed the environmental and economic impacts of construction and demolition (C&D) sectors, with special focus on the production and management of its waste materials. This study reviews and organizes the recent literature within the framework of the CE to explore how its key principles (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) apply to the management of C&D waste (C&DW). The reviewed literature mainly focuses on changes of environmental impacts as a consequence of CE implementation. Impacts have been mainly quantified by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, under the adoption of different boundaries of analysis, although other economic and biophysical approaches were also applied to a minor extent. The final goal of this study is evaluating if the adoption of the CE framework is environmentally and economically sustainable, given that the recovery of waste materials requires investments of resources. Different type of barriers (economic, political, legislative, informative and managerial) as well as solutions and success factors for implementing an effective management of C&DW within a circular framework are also pointed out. Results show that in most cases the reuse/recycling of C&DW at the end-of-life of a building as well as the production of recycled products provide environmental and economic benefits. Nevertheless, the environmental and economic sustainability of CE framework is very site specific and depends on several factors such as the type of material, building elements, transport distances, economic and political context. Finally, several directions for future research have been proposed: increased LCA modelling for sustainability evaluation, a wider development of cleaner production strategies focused on circular design, and finally the adoption of a comprehensive accounting of input and output flows, in order to assign appropriate weights to flows and benefits that are most often disregarded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041839257

However, instead of doing less damage to the environment, it is necessary to learn how one can participate with the environment by using the health of ecological systems as a basis for design. The shift from a fragmented to a whole systems model is the significant cultural leap that consumer society needs to make - through framing and understanding living system interrelationships in an integrated way. A place-based approach is one way to achieve this understanding. The design process begins by attempting to understand how the systems of life work in each unique place.

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long ""lookahead"" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers.

To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement.

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and designers to analyse the implication of designs decision on the salvage performance of buildings over time. It will also be useful to the demolition engineers and consultants to generate pre-demolition audit when the building gets to end of its life. © 2017 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032454911

The potential to fabricate elements directly from design information is transforming many design and production disciplines. In particular, 3D printing has become the key of modern product development. As the use of additive manufacturing grows, research into large-scale processes is beginning to reveal potential applications in construction. The combined methods of computational design and robotic fabrication have the well-demonstrated potential to create formal and structural advances in architecture. However, their potential contribution to the improvement of sustainability in construction must be evaluated. In this study, we identified environmental guidelines to be considered during the design of digitally fabricated architecture. The key parameters were extracted from the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of three case studies. The environmental assessment performed indicated that the relative sustainability of the projects depended primarily on the building material production. Specifically, the impact of digital fabrication processes was negligible compared to the materials manufacturing process. Furthermore, the study highlighted the opportunities of integrating additional functions in structural elements with digital fabrication to reduce the overall environmental impact of these multi-functional elements. Finally, the analysis proved the potential of digital fabrication to reduce the amount of highly industrialized materials in a project, which are associated with high environmental impacts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006512007

This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, “BIM leads and GIS supports” “GIS leads and BIM supports” and “BIM and GIS are equally involved” are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved.

Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. Cultural heritage buildings hold a unique niche in the urban landscape. In addition to shelter, they embody the local cultural and historic characteristics that define communities. Therefore, extending their useful lifespan has multiple benefits that extend beyond the project itself to the surrounding area, contributing to economic and social development. To explore this complex issue, the research applies systematic literature review and synthesis methods. Decision makers lack knowledge of the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings and lack tools to implement these projects. A new comprehensive circular economy framework for the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts intends to meet these needs.

Over the last decades, a paradigm shift has been occurring in the industry at large, with the adoption of a Circular Economy model, that aims at keeping the materials in a closed loop to retain their maximum value, therefore with a greater potential of reducing the waste generation and resources extraction for the Construction Industry.

A qualitative approach is used to revisit the design, construction, and demolition stages of prefabricated buildings; in so doing, the circular-economy framework is applied to foster circular prefabricated modi operandi. Prefabrication of buildings can be divided into four entities: elements and components, panels (or non-volumetric elements), volumetric, and entire modules. Through an analysis of published research on how the circular economy can be applied to different industry sectors and production processes, seven strategies emerged, each of which revealed the potential of improving the circular economy of buildings. The first strategy is reduction of waste through a lean production chain. By reusing the waste, the second strategy investigates the use of by-products in the production of new components. The third strategy focuses on the reuse of replacement parts and components. The fourth strategy is based on design toward adaptability, respectively focusing on reusability of components and adapting components for a second use with a different purpose. Similarly, the fifth strategy considers the implications of designing for disassembly with Building Information Modeling so as to improve the end-of-life deconstruction phase. The sixth strategy focuses on design with attention to recyclability of used material. Finally, the seventh strategy considers the use of tracking technologies with embedded information on components' geometric and mechanic characteristics as well as their location and life cycle to enable second use after deconstruction. It is demonstrated that prefabricated buildings are key to material savings, waste reduction, reuse of components, and various other forms of optimization for the construction sector. By adopting the identified strategies in prefabricated buildings, a circular economy could be implemented within the construction industry. Finally, seven guidelines were distilled from the review and linked to the identified strategies. Owing to their degree of adaptability and capacity of being disassembled, prefabricated buildings would allow waste reduction and facilitate a second life of components. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053866943

Research has also identified a significant opportunity to apply circular approaches to our rapidly changing industrial system, including manufacturing processes and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) which, with data, is enabling the latest advances in digital technologies (DT). Research which fuses these two areas has not been extensively explored. This is the first paper to provide a synergistic and integrative CE-DT framework which offers directions for policymakers and guidance for future research through a review of the integrated fields of CE and I4.0.

The large number of studies applying economy-wide material flow analysis so far mostly produced aggregated national indicators, making the results difficult to connect to policies, which are often designed for single sectors or consumption areas. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the composition of EU’s material footprint in its global context, aiming at identifying the main product groups contributing to overall material consumption and specifying the geographical sources for the raw materials required to satisfy EU’s final demand. Based on multi-regional input–output (MRIO) modeling, we apply production layer decomposition to assess supply chains and their structural changes from 1995 to 2011. The global MRIO database used in this study is EXIOBASE 3, which disaggregates 200 products and 163 industries, of which 33 represent material extraction sectors. By that means, we increase the level of detail to a degree where policies can more easily connect to. We find that the generally growing material footprint of the EU was characterized by a dramatic shift regarding the origin of raw materials, with the share of materials extracted within the EU territory falling from 68 % in 1995 to 35 % in 2011. In 2011, raw materials extracted in China to produce exports to the EU already contributed an equal share to EU’s material footprint as material extraction within the EU itself. Import dependency is most critical for the material group of metal ores, with only 13 % of all metals required as inputs to EU final demand stemming from within the EU. Regarding product composition, construction was confirmed as the most important sector contributing to the material footprint, followed by the group of manufacturing products based on biomass. Materials embodied in service sector activities together contributed a quarter to the total material footprint in 2011, making services an important, but currently disregarded area for European resource policies. We also find that supply chain structures became more complex over time, with a growing part located outside the EU territory. © 2016, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020826572

The applications of AI to sustainable architecture include energy-efficient building design, forecasting and minimizing energy consumption, strategizing for mitigating impacts on environment and climate, and enhancements in the safety and comfort of the living environment. Due to the significant increases in internet speed and accessibility and the drops in computer prices and data storage costs in recent years, Big Data (BD) nowadays plays an important supplementary role to AI. Algorithms and computer codes have been developed for data mining and analysis. BD rejuvenates AI methods and applications in many areas, including sustainable architecture. The present paper starts with an introduction to AI history and techniques. This is followed by a discussion on how AI and BD can be used to design and operate energy–efficient commercial buildings and residential houses, followed by a review of recent applications of AI and BD to energy-efficient buildings with an emphasis on the use of machine learning (ML) and large databases. Future research topics are suggested at the end of this paper. It is reemphasized in the present paper that AI, when combined with BD, can tremendously increase the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of buildings which are designed to provide occupants with a comfortable indoor living environment. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071309228

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework.

Despite the wide use and importance attributed to the concepts of “restoration” and “regeneration,” they are rarely defined or explained in the circular economy literature. In this context, this study critically examines the two terms, while providing guidance on their future utilization and development. Specifically, the study investigates the origin of the concepts, their adoption in frameworks that anticipated the idea of the circular economy, and their connotations in the circular economy literature. The examination supports the need for clear and distinct definitions, combined with precision in usage. From a review of the literature, restoration is a better-defined concept than regeneration, although it needs conceptual re-enforcement relative to the biological/ecological aspects of the circular economy. This study suggests looking in the direction of restoration ecology, a well-established branch of ecological research. Conversely, regeneration is a symbolic/evocative term with little practical application in the context of circular systems except in the case of certain agricultural practices. Until new conceptual developments intervene, regeneration does not seem to be applicable to the economy as a whole and because of this, might be abandoned as a guiding principle of the circular economy. Unlike regeneration, restoration can be considered a core principle because it has widespread application and can be a point of reference for circular applications. This does not preclude the possibility that other concepts may be needed to augment restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

Even though the global sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings’ end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system. Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs to circular economy and sustainability requirements. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063271544

Cradle-to-Cradle® in particular has put forward the idea of buildings as material banks, radically altering the way material flows need to be managed. The notion of material banks (temporary storage of materials that comprise the building assemblies) sheds new light on the value of building materials and products, and how to maintain and restore this. The basics are straightforward: high quality, pure material use and anticipated material regeneration routes. The implications for the supply and value chain, however, are significant, and research in this direction has only recently taken off. To smoothen the path to implementation, circular building principles may be combined with Design-for-Adaptability (DfA) guidelines, as developed over the last decades. DfA guidelines are rooted in enhanced resilience of the built environment on the one hand, and the associated constructive implications on the other. Synergy between the concepts of circularity and adaptability, with regard to the Dutch context, is at the heart of this paper. The main research question is: what are prerequisites for an effective performance of materials, products, services and buildings in the case circularity is a leading ambition? The research is structured around four interdisciplinary expert workshops in which knowledge and experiences were shared, discussed, tested and redefined, leading to a set of preconditions for circular building material and product flows. A key finding is that circularity-values emerge at the intersection of specific intrinsic properties (material and product characteristics) and relational properties (building design and use characteristics), whilst combining multiple parameters. In separation, neither intrinsic nor relational properties have decisive significance with regard to circularity; it is on the crossing where fulfillment is created.

The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077972233

Implementing a circular economy program requires radical changes in product, business model and ecosystem innovation. Most research on circular oriented innovation takes a product or business model perspective. Few publications have explored how to innovate in ecosystems: how a group of loosely coupled organizations can change how they interact with each other to achieve a collective outcome. This study proposes the Circularity Deck: a card deck-based tool that can help firms to analyze, ideate and develop the circularity potential of their innovation ecosystems. The tool is based on a literature review of circular oriented innovation principles, and of practical examples that show how these principles have been applied. The principles are organized according to the intended circular strategy outcome that they pursue (i.e., narrow, slow, close, regenerate and inform material and energy flows), and the extent of the innovation perspective that is needed to operationalize a principle (i.e., product, business model, or ecosystem innovation). This review and categorization process first produced a novel analysis of the circular economy innovation landscape, using an ecosystem perspective. Second, these results served to develop the Circularity Deck, which was further developed and tested for ease of use and perceived usefulness in 12 workshops with 136 participants from 62 different organizations. The Circularity Deck provides an approach for future research and practice to integrate new principles and examples that can help firms to analyze, ideate and develop circular innovation ecosystems. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081671734

A MP acts as a design optimisation tool, as well as an inventory of all materials embedded in a building and displays the recycling potential and environmental impact of buildings. In this paper, the proof of concept for a MP is demonstrated on a use case, which is a residential building, whereby a variant in timber and a variant in concrete construction are evaluated. Results show that the recycling potential of the concrete variant is better; however, concrete leads to more waste, due to its significantly higher mass in comparison with timber. The comparison of the environmental impact of the variants shows, that the variant in timber has a significantly lower impact to the environment, than the variant in concrete.

While literature has highlighted the opportunities for IoT to support circular strategies in business, little has been published about actual implementations in practice. The aim of this study was therefore to understand how companies to date have implemented IoT for circular strategies, and how these implementations compare to the range of opportunities described in literature. To that end, a two-step approach was followed. Firstly, building on academic literature, a framework was developed which categorizes different IoT-enabled circular strategies. The framework recognizes tracking, monitoring, control, optimization, and design evolution as IoT capabilities. Efficiency in use, increased utilization, and product lifetime extension are distinguished as circular in-use strategies, while reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling are distinguished as circular looping strategies. The framework complements previously published work, as it adds additional detail to the categorization, and allows for easy mapping of diverse cases. Secondly, 40 cases from practice were analyzed and mapped to the framework. This way, practice-based insights were derived about the current distribution of IoT-enabled circular strategies implemented in practice. The results show that current implementation of IoT-enabled circular strategies mainly supports two strategies in the use phase: efficiency in use and product lifetime extension. Only a small number of the reviewed cases display IoT-enabled looping (reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling). Similarly, few cases describe 'design evolution' for CE, i.e., the feedback of data from products in use to support circular design. Based on these results, this study identifies the need for future research to further investigate why IoT-enabled looping strategies and design evolution for circular strategies have not been implemented to scale. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073975550

This paper describes the process of documenting materials and products utilized in the construction of the Urban Mining and Recycling (UMAR) unit within the Madaster platform. UMAR is a fully circular residential unit of Empa NEST created from secondary resources and designed as a material depot for future constructions. Madaster is an online platform, which generates and registers materials passports and calculates a Circularity Indicator for their construction, use, and end-of-life phases.

They represent the operational infrastructure for waste management and include Drosscapes, generating complex relations with the servicing and surrounding territory. In particular, the peri-urban areas are spatially affected by these processes. This often leads to ineffective use and/or abandonment because they are currently impossible to use, demanding impactful (and often expensive) regeneration and revalorization to make them usable again. Being part of the urban metabolic process, wastescapes are in a continuous state of dynamic equilibrium. They can be considered crucial areas from a metropolitan perspective because they have the potential to become innovative spatial contexts or resources in a Circular Economy (CE), which aims to overcome the crises of both resource scarcity and spatial fragmentation.

Here, the Hybrid Living Material (HLM) fabrication platform is presented, which integrates computational design, additive manufacturing, and synthetic biology to achieve replicable fabrication and control of biohybrids. The approach involves modification of multimaterial 3D-printer descriptions to control the distribution of chemical signals within printed objects, and subsequent addition of hydrogel to object surfaces to immobilize engineered Escherichia coli and facilitate material-driven chemical signaling. As a result, the platform demonstrates predictable, repeatable spatial control of protein expression across the surfaces of 3D-printed objects. Custom-developed orthogonal signaling resins and gene circuits enable multiplexed expression patterns. The platform also demonstrates a computational model of interaction between digitally controlled material distribution and genetic regulatory responses across 3D surfaces, providing a digital tool for HLM design and validation. Thus, the HLM approach produces biohybrid materials of wearable-scale, self-supporting 3D structure, and programmable biological surfaces that are replicable and customizable, thereby unlocking paths to apply industrial modeling and fabrication methods toward the design of living materials. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

By a series of literature review and analyses, a material and component bank was proposed to manage more effectively the recycling of materials and direct reuse of components even of whole components obtained from old structures to facilitate a more sustainable construction industry. The concept, main businesses, and work operation of the bank were illustrated in detail including its potential management method and supply chain. The relationship between the bank and current building information modeling, design for deconstruction, supply chain, and life cycle assessment based on the bank were then analyzed in detail. It can be concluded that the bank could pave the way for effectively performing a further and repaid reuse of components and perfecting current recycling of materials to contribute a more sustainable built environment from the view of various terms mentioned in this study. The bank also can link with current method of life cycle assessment or environmental impact assessment well, which all can promote the construction sustainability indicating the bank can be integrated into current construction industry easily for the future.

Blockchain technology can be used to further improve the information management systems in construction, provide more automation and mitigate many possible legal conflicts by default. Implementation of blockchain technology in the construction industry can also result in the use of smart contracts with fewer administrative struggles, improve the flow of the project, material, and service delivery, and increase the security and currentness of BIM or project documents.

Recent studies on resource efficiency have found the ""anthropogenic stock"" of the building sector to outweigh natural resource stocks. To make the anthropogenic stock accessible, material quantities with their individual composition need to be estimated and extrapolated to regional level. A geographical information system (GIS) is used as tool to handle the building specific data and combine them on regional level to calculate the anthropogenic stock. The resulting resource cadaster reflects the material quantities, divided into sixteen material fractions, of a specific residential district in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area-a typical urban area in Germany. The case study area was weighted in total between 103.5 kt and 93 kt, depending on the dataset. This paper offers a step-by-step description of this approach, whereby a consistent dataset was created throughout the process of data collection and validation. In order to demonstrate the broader application of the resource cadaster, the results were extrapolated to the residential building sector of the entire federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In highly concentrated areas, like the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan area, both area-wide classification of material quantities and their regional localization are necessary to make the anthropogenic stock accessible. Information about toxic substances, however, also needs to be included in the process of data collection. This method of mapping could thus provide the foundation for future (re)uses of this stock.

This paper aims to explore the potential application of advanced data mining techniques for effective utilization of big building operational data. A case study of mining the operational data of an educational building for performance improvement is presented. Decision tree, clustering analysis, and association rule mining are adopted to analyze the operational data. The results show that useful knowledge can be extracted for identifying typical building operation patterns, detecting operation deficiencies, and spotting energy conservation opportunities. Practical application: The current utilization of big building operational data in the building industry is rather limited due to the lack in experience of using advanced big data analytics.

Interest in the circular economy (CE) concept of slowing, narrowing and closing material loops through CE strategies (reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle and recover) has grown in recent years to facilitate minimising these unresolved issues emanating from the building industry. Although CE initiatives are proliferating within the industry, wide-scale adoption of CE is still lacking, and the current development and implementation of CE building design and construction strategies is fragmented. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), this study assesses which design and construction strategies are being linked to the concept of CE for new buildings, and their level of application and readiness in a building context. On this basis, the study offers insight into how this field of research is developing and provides directions for future research. From the SLR, a taxonomy is presented that groups the strategies together into 16 overarching building design and construction strategies. An important gap preventing a greater CE uptake within the industry was found to include the lack of knowledge about the environmental performance and related benefits of the various building design and construction strategies. Thus, it is suggested that conveying more comprehensive and uniform adoption of CE in the building industry requires the development of a new design typology to facilitate CE-oriented decision-making in a building context and that prioritises the strategies according to their potential in terms of minimising building-related environmental impacts. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

One of the main strategies to minimize environmental impacts and the energy consumption is maximizing recycling rates. To enable circularity, and in consequence high recycling rates, material information about the existing building stock is necessary. Therefore, new design-centric tools and methods, as well as tools, which enable a compilation of data repositories on the material composition of buildings, are required. The first aim of this research is the generation of a Building Information Modelling (BIM) - supported Material Passport (MP), which enables an assessment of the recycling potential and environmental impacts of building materials. For the compilation of the semi-automated MP, a specific methodology was developed and tested on a use case. Thereby various challenges regarding data and stakeholders were faced, such as inconsistent data and lack of collaboration between various stakeholders. These challenges lead to the second focus of this paper – the development of a data- and stakeholder management framework. The data- and stakeholder management framework presents the required collaboration of various stakeholders in order to achieve a successful implementation of the MP in the AEC industry. Results show, that a semi-automated compilation of the BIM-based MP is possible and the implementation of the MP in the AEC industry requires close collaboration of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, thus forming a need for creating digital platforms for life cycle management of buildings and material resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061707972

Consuming enormous amounts of constructional and operational water deplete water resources and ultimately generates a high environmental impact. This is mainly due to the energy required for the water cycle of built environments, which involves raw water treatment and distribution, use within buildings, and wastewater treatment. Moreover, the impact of water use varies significantly among countries/regions, due to different water use cycles. For example, many countries use conventional water treatments, while others rely on advanced desalination. Unlike building energy use, the impact of water use in buildings has not been captured fully in research. Given the significant impact of water use in buildings and global environmental degradation, we aimed to review studies concentrating on constructional and operational water use and associated environmental impacts, as well as studies that employed life cycle assessment (LCA) on this topic. The review indicated that a limited number of studies have focused on this serious issue in recent years, and their aims differed greatly. Therefore, there is a notable research gap in comprehensive environmental impact assessment including the total human water use cycle. Complete environmental assessment through LCA enables building professionals to understand the wide-ranging impact of water use in a building's life cycle from the environmental perspective in a given region.

To address this, applying circular economy principles to the building sector is crucial, for example by reusing building elements from demolition sites rather than extracting and producing new materials. However, most current life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools are not appropriate to evaluate the environmental impact of a building when its components originate from prior buildings and/or will be used in future unknown ones. Still, robust measurement is needed to demonstrate the benefits of reuse towards environmentally sustainable cities. This paper compares existing methodologies to quantify the global warming potential (GWP, expressed in kgCO2e/unit) of recycled/recyclable and reused/reusable products, selected within widely recognised standards, rating schemes, and academic studies, such as the cut-off method, the end-of-life method, the distributed allocation (PAS-2050) method, the Environmental Footprint method, the Degressive method and the SIA 2032 method. Based on these recognised approaches for assessing the GWP of products, new equations are written and applied to buildings with reused/reusable materials for each of the methods. The Kopfbau Halle 118 building (Winterthur, CH, 2021), which is designed with reclaimed elements from local demolition sites, is chosen as a case study. Discrepancies in LCA methods are highlighted by applying them to three different life cycles corresponding to the first, intermediate, or final use of building components. This paper shows that current quantification methods to assess reuse give wide-ranging results and do not address the full spectrum of the reuse practice, that their boundaries are too limited, and that a number of critical features are currently hardly quantifiable, such as embedded use value, versatility, storage and transformation impacts, user-owner separation, dis/re-mountability, or design complexity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088650514

On the other hand it demands the integration of the collected data with other management information systems. Digitization and especially the advent of big data science bring along promising opportunities to create effective smart monitoring and predictive maintenance applications. The aim of this research is to examine the possibilities of a predictive maintenance framework based on the design principles of Industry 4.0 and recent developments in distributed computing, Big Data and Machine Learning. It introduces numerous enabling technologies such as industrial Internet of things, standardized communication protocols, as well as edge and cloud computing. Moreover, it takes a deeper look at data analytical techniques and tools, and analyses performance of well-known machine learning algorithms. Paper proposes architecture of a predictive maintenance framework based on existing software and hardware solutions. As a proof of concept, a real-life smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) application system is created and tested to demonstrate the possibilities of the proposed PdM framework. © 2018, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

The built environment can be made more circular by applying circular building components. The purpose of this paper is to present a design tool that can support industry in developing circular building components. Design/methodology/approach: The tool was developed and tested in five steps. In Step 1, the authors analysed existing circular design frameworks to identify gaps and develop requirements for the design tool (Step 2). In Step 3, the authors derived circular design parameters and options from existing frameworks. In Step 4, the authors combined and specified these to develop the “circular building components generator” (CBC-generator). In Step 5, the CBC-generator was applied in the development of an exemplary component: the circular kitchen and tested in a student workshop. Findings: The CBC-generator is a three-tiered design tool, consisting of a technical, industrial and business model generator. These generators are “parameter based”; they consist of a parameter-option matrix and design canvasses. Different variants for circular components can be synthesised by filling the canvasses through systematically “mixing and matching” design options. Research limitations/implications: The developed tool does not yet support establishing causal links between “parameter-options” and identification of the most circular design variant. Practical implications: The CBC-generator provides an important step to support the building industry in developing and implementing circular building components in the built environment. Originality/value: Whilst existing tools and frameworks are not comprehensive, nor specifically developed for designing circular building components, the CBC-generator successfully supports the integral design of circular building components. First, it provides all the design parameters which should be considered; second, it provides extensive design options per parameter; and third, it supports systematic synthesis of design options to a cohesive and comprehensive circular design. © 2019, Anne van Stijn and Vincent Gruis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074415627

This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ""design from a stock"" scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. ""design with a stock"" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible.

Many argue that we need a shift in worldview from mechanistic to regenerative, and in order to do so we must engage with the living world by (re)aligning human and natural systems. This paper proposes a 'proactive' retrofit approach which seeks to integrate net-positive, restorative and regenerative design concepts into building retrofits. A regenerative design model that explores the key interactions between physical, human and natural systems is developed to achieve these proactive outcomes. A set of regenerative design principles for building retrofits are proposed to emphasise the positive interactions an existing building can have with its surrounding environment. More specifically, this paper will explore how an energy efficient building retrofit can improve occupant health and wellbeing, and restore and enhance local ecosystems.

From the recycling/reusing perspective, a key enabler towards CE is Industrial Symbiosis (IS). Although IS has been widely applied in manufacturing industries, its implementation is unclear in the construction industry. Particularly, the potential IS economic convenience is hard to predict in the highly fragmented construction supply chain. This study explores the IS based on the Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) in the context of a concrete waste supply chain in the Twente region of the Netherlands. The research tackles with the CE challenge of lacking economic incentives by investigating the Industrial Symbiosis Network (ISN) emerged by replacing Primary Concrete Aggregates (PCA) with RCA. An Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach is proposed by integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to present the dynamic supply-demand of RCA. Besides, supply chain actors are simulated as negotiable agents in a platform model to reveal the IS collaboration dynamics under different economic scenarios. It is found that the IS exists in the construction industry but only in an implicit manner because the RCA treatment requires the collaboration of multiple actors across substantial temporal and spatial differences. The study enriches the IS taxonomy by defining Implicit IS and provides instruments to support the decision-making of business collaborations and policy-making for a circular construction industry. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100513528

Resource efficiency includes the reduction of primary and non-renewable materials, the creation of high-quality products with minimal waste, and the retention of long-term product value. One potential source of resource efficiency is the increased adoption of industrialized housing construction which includes novel construction methods and products. Current literature identifies numerous opportunities for resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction. However, this literature is scattered across several sources and units of analysis. Using a Systematic Literature Review, this paper identifies eight recurrent product and process-related themes and fifteen specific subthemes of resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction across building lifecycle phases. These themes can be based on product such as the use of innovative and industrial materials or on process such as the use of inventory monitoring and tracking. Additional industry and regulatory themes are also identified. Furthermore using frequency analysis of literature, the paper finds while themes of resource efficiency exist across all building lifecycle phases, the most recurring themes occur in design, manufacturing and logistics phases. There is less literature dedicated to resource efficiency during occupancy and end-of-life phases. The paper further discusses how early design decisions such as material design have a systems-level impact that propagates throughout the building lifecycle, and how a beyond-systems approach is needed between stakeholders and processes to integrate current resource efficiency potentials into industrialized housing construction practice. Finally, the paper identifies future research directions for resource-efficient industrialized housing construction including concepts of circular economy, value chain coordination, and socio-economic impacts. © 2020 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098572376

Obtaining and processing systematized and optimized information facilitates decision making in order to innovate, create value and adopt measures to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in construction. Building Materials Passports (BMPs) are tools for inserting circular economy in buildings. They can be crucial in managing and providing information to stakeholders in industry value chains, with the aim of promoting the construction of more sustainable and resilient cities, where materials are identified in a database, removed and reused in order to maintain, recover or even increase value and useful life. This paper presents a proposal of a BMP applied to the wood frame system in Brazil, introducing the following guidelines: general information, safety, sustainability, use and operation, assembling directions, reuse and product service history. A case study was developed in a Brazilian company in order to test the application feasibility of the tool to the system. There were some barriers found in the development of the BMP regarding LCA data, as well as the end of life information of the material. This attempt to implement the BMP encourages practices of circular economy in the construction industry and, associated with the expanding use of wood frame in Brazil, contributes to flexible and renewable buildings. In addition, the main challenges for the introduction of BMP are discussed, emphasizing the need for joint action based on political initiatives and regulations that allow and facilitate circular practices in construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063377763

Traditionally to support innovative design, the fuzzy concept stage has long been supported by heuristic design philosophies. In recent years, new supportive technologies have enabled concept generation based on the collection and reuse of existing data. Existing data can be collected from various sources; for example, customer reviews, historical data, or by studying existing products or other industrial assets such as production machines and tooling. Lately, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) has gained a wealth of attention as a means to construct a high-fidelity digital copy of a physical asset and to study its shape, position, gesture, status and motion. The common aim of the DT is to support the realistic model of system behavior that can support performance prediction and optimization. However, in providing sufficient support during the conceptual stages the realistic models become heavy and costly to adapt. While the emerging data-driven design approaches can be used to generate designs with alterations, there is a lack of support to generate and evaluate solutions during the conceptual stages. In this paper, a framework of a Digital Platform Twin (DPT) is proposed to fill this gap. In contrast to a sole high-fidelity digital representation, the DPT builds on abstracting multiple high-fidelity Digital Twins into a low-fidelity platform model, represented as a function model. The DPT framework proclaims the vision of supporting design engineers in the process of abstracting functionalities of existing assets, inserting new functionalities and technologies in the function structure to ultimately support the generation and evaluation of new functional concepts. To demonstrate the DPT framework, an automotive example is presented. We believe that design reuse can be enabled during platform concept development with the use of multiple DTs. To achieve this, a challenge is to practically realize the transcending in abstraction levels of the models: from Digital Twins to function model and from function model to geometry models. The transcending in abstraction levels is therefore a matter of future work. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

To achieve this goal, a multi-user platform was designed and developed to manage and control all stages and procedures of public work and provide support to all those involved throughout the various stages of implementation. The platform included (1) technical standards; (2) environmental law; (3) databases; (4) technical specifications for public tenders; (5) a tool to assess environmental impacts and circularity; (6) a marketplace to facilitate and transparently manage trading of natural, artificial, and recycled aggregates; (7) interactive catalogues with declarations of building products; and (8) interactive maps for the geolocation of treatment plants, producers, and construction sites.

This study demonstrates what those possibilities may be. Previous studies showed that: deconstruction practices pose several site-based challenges; BIM implementations may help practitioners to address such challenges; and activity theory offers a framework to understand BIM implementations. We aimed to explore how deconstruction practices can be reorganised with BIM by applying an activity-theoretical perspective to a rather unique case-study. The selected case concerned the deconstruction of a nursing home so that many of its elements could be reused to construct a school. During this project, we implemented BIM in three essential activities: analysing existing conditions, labelling of reusable elements and planning deconstruction. The implementations resolved initial problems related with the use of traditional drawings, schedules and instructions. They nevertheless also triggered several additional problems that we attempted to address in successive steps. The organisation of the activities so evolved, which culminated in the formation of three new BIM uses for deconstruction: “3D existing conditions analysis,” “reusable elements labelling” and “4D deconstruction simulation”. These concepts complement existing BIM use taxonomies and can be appropriated in future deconstruction projects. © 2021 The Author(s).

Construction activities continue to increase the carbon footprint and eject contaminated materials into the ecological environment with dire consequences for economic and social sustainability. As a result of the adverse impacts of construction activities, it is necessary for construction firms to rethink their approach to the use of conventional business models. The purpose of this study is to explore a framework for the adoption of green business models to drive sustainability in the construction industry of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: This research is exploratory due to its focus on emerging economies in which there is a perceptible gap in the adoption of green business models. As a result of this, this paper is entrenched in the interpretivist philosophical stance, which led to the adoption of the qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken involving 13 senior managers of construction firms. A thematic analysis was used with the aid of qualitative data analysis computer software package to code the interview transcripts. Findings: The results demonstrate the six definitions of green business models among the managers of construction firms. The study also shows the need for developing green business models to address the issues of circularity and sustainability goals to reduce carbon footprints in the construction industry. Similarly, the paper found various sources of information to drive the awareness, understanding and adoption of the components for green business models. These sources include international conferences and training workshops on green business models. Finally, the study presents a framework that integrates the building information modelling (BIM) and the Internet of things (IoT) into the components for green business models adoption in construction firms. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to use the quantitative approach to undertake further empirical studies, as this paper focuses mostly on the qualitative approach to ascertain the nature of the relationship between green business model and the various components of the circular economy in the construction industry. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing knowledge on green business models by demonstrating six key pillars of green business models by the inclusion of digital technologies such as BIM and IoT, which hitherto this investigation have not been considered in the adoption of green business models in the construction industry.

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables.

In parallel, the research in Robotic Timber Construction (RTC) has evolved rapidly, focusing both on fabrication and assembly processes in order to improve the productivity of the construction industry and extend the production digital chain. This paper presents an original workflow for the automation from design to layered robotic assembly of reversible timber structures, aided by human-robot collaboration. An advanced digital design workflow for non-standard timber structures is established, shifting the focus towards the assembly of a kit of discrete wood elements into larger configurations that can be reconfigured in time. Linked to this, collaborative robots are employed for grasping, positioning and fixing of discrete timber elements, with the introduction of a multi-phase end effector that connects wood elements through reversible joinery. As such, the work introduces fundamental design and manufacturing concepts for an automated construction process that extends the material life cycle of wood, and consequently, its carbon store. The enhancement of robotic assembly is here achieved with the (1) integration of a feedback system based on location and force signals, and (2) human collaboration to provide immediate assistance to the robot in the case the signals do not match the defined assembly conditions.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the implications, considerations, contributions and challenges of BIM integrated LCA and the CE adoption in the industry by critically analyzing the recent literature. A scientometric analysis was applied to the selected studies to show the knowledge among BIM, LCA and CE relationships.

The use of cyber-physical information for online identification, examination and exchange of reusable components may improve their life‐cycle management and circularity. To this end, a bi‐directional data exchange system is established between physical building components and their virtual Building Information Modeling (BIM) counterparts, so that their life‐cycle information—including history of ownership, maintenance record, technical specifications and physical condition—can be tracked, monitored and managed. The resultant prototype Cloud‐based BIM platform is then adapted to support an ongoing product‐service relationship between suppliers/providers and users/clients. A case study from a major new hospital, focusing upon an example of internal framed glazed systems, is presented for ”proof of concept” and to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. The result of the case study shows that, informed by the life‐cycle data from the Cloud‐BIM platform, a “lease with reuse” service option is able to deliver a lower total cost and less carbon intensity for each unit of frame‐glazed module.

Open standard data models enable robust and efficient data exchange which underpins the successful implementation of a circular economy. One of the largest opportunities to reduce the total life cycle cost of a built asset is to use the building information modelling (BIM) approach during the operational phase because it represents the largest share of the entire cost. BIM models that represent the actual conditions and performance of the constructed assets can boost the benefits of the installed monitoring systems and reduce maintenance and operational costs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a horizontal investigation of current BIM data models and their use for describing circular economy principles and performance monitoring of built assets. Based on the investigation, an extension to the industry foundation classes (IFC) specification, recommendations and guidelines are presented which enable to describe circular economy principles and asset monitoring using IFC. Findings: Current open BIM data models are not sufficiently mature yet. This limits the interoperability of the BIM approach and the implementation of circular economy principles.

Almost all demolition waste is used as filler material for the construction of roads, preventing further reuse or recycling after this application. The built environment generates considerable annual material in-and outflows. However, there has been little discussion on the availability and further application of this potential supply of secondary materials as a replacement for primary materials. In this study, we quantify the percentage of demolition waste that can be repurposed as secondary materials in the Dutch construction sector. We analyzed the yearly building material flows for the municipality of Leiden using municipal data on demolition and construction to explore the viability of the Dutch government’s policy goal to reduce primary materials consumption by 50% before 2030. From this analysis, we find that the recycling of demolition waste has a sizable potential but just falls short of the stated policy goal. Even in a situation with more construction than demolition, there will remain a considerable mismatch in the yearly construction material demand and available supply of demolition waste for our municipal-wide case study. More importantly, the current processing of demolition waste in the Netherlands will require significant improvements to achieve this goal.

BIM is an essential and powerful tool to create and manage digital information. As such, it can be used for materials passports. Which information is needed and reliable? How can we extract it from a BIM model? The current debate issues ""which information is needed?"" with the assumption that it will be all settled with BIM. Indeed, BIM has great potential when it comes to gain and share information, but what are the possibilities and how to maximise its potential? This paper clears the discussion by giving better understanding about BIM and circular design using the different phases of the lifecycle to get a grip on how information develops during the process. A circular economy requires a paradigm-shift: buildings as material banks. Each building will have a 'materials passport' and new buildings will be built reversible and reusable using BIM. A circular BIM model is needed and should be created with the least possible effort in order to maximise its potential on an affordable way. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063400559

One strategy to reuse structural components is to design structures that can be assembled, taken apart, and reassembled in new configurations. This paper presents a new computational workflow to design a bespoke kit of parts that can be employed to build structures of diverse typologies and that are not restricted to repetitive modular arrangements. Key to this method is the optimization of structural members and joints (i.e. the kit of parts) that fit multiple geometries and different structural requirements. The proposed method includes form finding and digital fabrication and it applies to the design of trusses, gridshells, and space frames. This method has been successfully applied to build three pavilion-scale prototypes from only half the number of parts compared to one-off construction. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101920470

This article addresses two aspects of understanding and managing vacant houses: the difficulty of understanding their spatial and temporal patterns and the management of the social costs behind the phenomenon of vacant houses. These aspects are approached by combining a 4D GIS analysis with expert interviews and additional qualitative tools to assess the spatial and temporal dimension of vacant houses. Furthermore, this manuscript presents a tool to estimate the obsolete dwelling material stock distribution within a city. The case of the city of Kitakyushu demonstrates the relationship that exists between the historical trajectories of housing norms and standards, such as comfort, cleanliness, safety, and convenience, and the dynamics of the built material stock and demography for three selected neighbourhoods. The results show that the more locked-in a district is in terms of ""obsolete norms and codes"", the more likely it is that the obsolete stock is dead, and consequently, urban mining should be considered. The article concludes that a revisiting of the norms and standards of convenience and other domains is one of the prerequisites of the transition toward a circular built environment and the prevention of obsolete stock accumulation. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088013088

Simultaneously it is one of the least digitalized industries. With increasing levels of urbanization, scarceness of resources and lack of landfills, the policy of circular economy (CE) is becoming increasingly important in the construction industry. The European Union is obliging material recovery of construction and demolition waste to a minimum of 70% by weight by 2020 for all new construction projects. Simultaneously, digitalization in construction is one of the major goals in the EU digitalization action plan. We thereby hypothesize that digital technologies have significant potential to support CE in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) in multiple ways – for assessment of resources as well as for the prediction and optimization of upcoming waste and recycling masses. Based on our conducted and ongoing research projects-BIMaterial: Process-Design for a BIM-based Material Passport; SCI_BIM: Scanning and data capturing for the Integrated Resources and Energy Assessment using Building Information Modeling; and finally a Case Study reviewing digital tools and processes within a large design and planning company (DPC)-we assess to which degree and to what purpose digital technologies are used, and define the potentials and challenges for the realization of CE objectives in the construction industry. Based on the conducted assessment, we propose a framework for a Digital Platform for Circular Economy (DEEP), integrating various stakeholders and data repositories on the external (inter)-firm and internal (intra)-firm level, using open interfaces. Such a platform for the AEC aims to optimize the use of resources in the circular economy – from cradle to grave, foster mutual learning and coordination, and finally generate added value along the life cycle of a building project. © 2020 Engineering Project Organization Society.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101840245

Mycelium is the vegetative part of fungus which can cement particulate substrate and can be formed into any shape if grown in a mould. Mycelium biocomposites (MBs) are rapidly being seen as green alternative for many hydrocarbon-based products, including Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) used for insulation in the construction industry. This is largely due to its comparable acoustic/insulative properties, superior fire safety and minimal environmental impact. Furthermore, as MBs can utilize low cost readily available commercial waste products such as wheat husks as a composite substrate, a clear value chain upscaling can be envisioned. Throughout its linear lifecycle, EPS insulation pose numerus environmental issues, including high resource use and challenges in its end of life disposal. Even if disposed correctly it can take thousands of years to degrade, evidently making it extremely difficult to properly contain. This has resulted in bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals in food webs across the planet. Conversely, MBs are biodegradable and importantly can be used as raw material for the production of more MBs. When comparing life cycle assessment (LCA) and production, MBs are estimated to hold clear advantages in terms of reduced CO2 out put and costs. It is thus clear it holds the potential to become an ideal candidate for a ""cradle to cradle"" economy, in this sector. Despite these attributes, MB insulation still have evident disadvantages when compared to their hydrocarbon counterparts and could hinder its adoption on a commercial scale. These include higher density and issues with water uptake. Furthermore, there can be wide variability in material performance on the basis of which substrate composition fungal strain, incubation conditions and manufacturing techniques are used. This coupled with the relatively sparse research in this field makes full assessments and comparisons between studies more difficult. New design approaches will also have to be considered when producing MB due to the additional factors of working with growing organisms. MB offers new degrees of freedom to the designer to create shapes and internal geometries yet only seen when using 3d-printing but at a price which potentially is suited for mass production low price products such as advanced packaging products and composite sandwich structures with tailor-made porous internal stiffening elements. Fully commercialised MB products have however begun to emerge. These still largely rely on costly labour-intensive manufacturing practices but present as an ideal target for optimization through factory atomisation. Integrating other emerging technologies such as 3D printing and computerised optimizations could also allow for controlled growth of internal structures of MBs. This would enable the creation of novel green materials with greatly improved performance characteristics which can be tailors to specific requirements. Ultimately furthering their viability as a green option to traditional EPS insulation. © Proceedings of the NordDesign 2020 Conference, NordDesign 2020.

Currently, there are methods for recycling plastic, but these methods can be expensive and time-consuming, resulting in most of the plastic being thrown into the landfill. Because plastic does not fully degrade, it ends up in the ocean and other waterways, poisoning the water with toxins. The purpose of this research is to provide a solution to reducing plastic waste by creating an alternative method of recycling that utilises new technologies such as additive manufacturing, to create a building material that fits into the concept of the circular economy. The findings of this research explored the recycling of plastic by collecting plastic waste such as PLA (Polylactic Acid) from old 3D printed models and other sources. The plastic was recycled into filament for additive manufacturing (AM) and used to print a building component, establishing a foundational proof of concept for the use of recycled plastic as a potential building material. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091332315
