In some decision situations the extraction of subjective preferences is either difficult or undesirable. This paper proposes a method for the determination of objective weights which is based on the quantification of two fundamental notions of MCDM: the contrast intensity and the conflicting character of the evaluation criteria. The latter notion is of great importance in interfirm comparisons because the financial indices used are often highly correlated. The method developed is applied to a sample of industrial firms. The results are compared to those obtained by other sets of objective weights and show this method ensures a better compromise of the criteria examined. © 1995.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009496304

Furthermore, by analyzing in detail the statistical properties of normal cloud model, that is, an important kind of cloud models based on normal distribution and Gauss membership function, we show that normal cloud model can not only be viewed as a generalized normal distribution with weak constraints but also avoid the flaw of fuzzy sets to quantify the membership degree of an element as an accurate value between 0 and 1 and, therefore, may be more adaptive for the uncertainty description of linguistic concepts. Finally, two demonstration examples about the fractal evolution of plants and network topologies based on cloud models are given to illustrate the promising applications of cloud models in some more complex knowledge representation tasks. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-62149101392

While in building information modeling (BIM) conventional building information (such as geometry, material, or cost) can precisely be described using current modeling standards, information about SHM systems, referred to as “monitoring-related information” cannot be fully described on a well-defined, formal basis. In this paper, a BIM-based approach towards describing monitoring-related information is proposed, using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open BIM standard facilitating the interoperability of BIM models, as a formal basis. First, possibilities and constraints of describing monitoring-related information with the IFC schema are discussed. Then, information necessary to describe SHM systems is integrated into a semantic model serving as a technology-independent metamodel. Next, the IFC schema is extended to enable BIM-based descriptions of SHM systems in compliance with IFC modeling capabilities, which is referred to as “IFC Monitor” schema. The IFC Monitor schema is verified with test software used in the official IFC certification program. For validation, a prototype SHM system is formally described using the IFC Monitor schema. The validation aims at checking if the IFC Monitor schema is capable of precisely describing monitoring-related information. As will be shown in this paper, the description of the prototype SHM system meets the requirements of a well-defined IFC model as specified in the official IFC certification program. As a result, the IFC Monitor schema proposed in this study advances BIM-based descriptions of SHM systems in association with structural systems being monitored on a well-defined, formal basis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046801394

An evaluation criterion for failure analysis of concrete arch dams is then established based on elastic strain energy. An orthotropic damage constitutive model for dam concrete is then proposed along with its numerical simulation method, which is established for structural failure analysis. Numerical simulations show that the elastic strain energy in elements increases with increasing overload safety coefficient and finally converges to the concrete material surface energy, at which time the locally plastic damage area develops rapidly and finally leads to cracking failure of structures.

Although such construction practices have advantages in terms of cost competitiveness and delivery time, they have many issues related to structural integrity and secondary stresses from vibration during transit and misalignment during installation. Therefore, monitoring the vibration, strain, and deformation of the modules using structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques is important. The primary purpose of this study is to explore building information modeling (BIM) techniques to facilitate effective data management and the representation of sensory components of the SHM system in a building and to render or visualize the damage or distress in building components based on the interpretation of sensor data. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: (1) an automated sensor-based data acquisition and storage module, which extracts sensor data for a structure from a corresponding relational database; and (2) an automated data and damage visualization module, through which sensor data are interpreted to identify damage or anomalies in the structure and the affected building components are highlighted and tagged in the BIM of the building to facilitate visualization. The damaged or near-damaged elements of the modules are highlighted in the BIM model through color-coding based on predefined threshold strain values. Because detecting buckled or yielded steel members (local damages) in a building or a module is challenging given that these components are often hidden behind fireproof coating and drywall, the proposed SHM-based condition assessment system will contribute - especially in the preinstallation and operational phases - to providing efficient, near-real-time health monitoring of buildings and increasing the efficiency of the structural condition assessment process. These benefits could be particularly useful for modular buildings, for which the modules are constructed in a plant and transported to the site for installation. In these stages, a module may undergo hidden or visible damage, the installed sensors are expected to provide a mechanism to assess such damage, and the entire process can be managed through BIM. Importantly, note that although a similar concept was explored by other researchers to integrate SHM with BIM, the present study provides a more comprehensive methodology through the complete implementation of the system to demonstrate the concept through a case study. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062769273

A number of high and ultra- high dams are being constructed in China's western region. The current dam construction practice tends to focus on socio- economic benefits and neglect the environment and ecology. Furthermore, periodic examinations are intended to ensure the structural safety of dams. This paper proposes a general evaluation principle for dam service. This principle stipulates that dam projects should have maximum socio-economic benefits and minimum negative effects on the environment and ecology. To satisfy the general principle of mutual harmony, socio-economic benefits, dam safety, environment, and ecology are analyzed, and the evaluation methods for dam service status are discussed. Then, a fusion algorithm of interlayer assessment is proposed on the basis of evidence theory and the fuzzy comprehensive analysis method. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation model is established. Example analysis shows that the proposed theories and methods can fulfill scientific assessment of the service status of dams. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866090197

In order to deal with the fuzziness and randomness of dam failure, the cloud model was introduced into the risk assessment of dam failure, which was combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) method and fuzzy theory, and then the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive assessment of dam failure risk was realized based on the cloud model. The improved AHP based on the judgment scaled with cloud model was proposed, and the cloud model was also used to determine the membership function in fuzzy assessment of dam failure risk, finally the group decision can be made with the improved algorithm that integrated methods of AHP and fuzzy with cloud model. Based on the improved algorithm, a system for fuzzy comprehensive assessment of dam failure risk based on cloud model was designed and developed.

Many of those bridges are ageing and exhibit significant potential risks. Frequent risk-based inspection and maintenance management of highway bridges is particularly essential for public safety. At present, most bridges rely on manual inspection methods for management. The efficiency is extremely low, causing the risk of bridge deterioration and defects to increase day by day, reducing the load-bearing capacity of bridges, and restricting the normal and safe use of them. At present, the applications of digital twins in the construction industry have gained significant momentum and the industry has gradually entered the information age. In order to obtain and share relevant information, engineers and decision makers have adopted digital twins over the entire life cycle of a project, but their applications are still limited to data sharing and visualization. This study has further demonstrated the unprecedented applications of digital twins to sustainability and vulnerability assessments, which can enable the next generation risk-based inspection and maintenance framework. This study adopts the data obtained from a constructor of Zhongcheng Village Bridge in Zhejiang Province, China as a case study. The applications of digital twins to bridge model establishment, information collection and sharing, data processing, inspection and maintenance planning have been highlighted. Then, the integration of “digital twins (or Building Information Modelling, BIM) + bridge risk inspection model” has been established, which will become a more effective information platform for all stakeholders to mitigate risks and uncertainties of exposure to extreme weather conditions over the entire life cycle. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101241361

Several engineering evaluations of the failure have been made since immediately following the disaster. Engineers involved in the construction of the dam recognized early on that the dam failed by sliding on its rock foundation. The dam was constructed on interbedded sedimentary rock, and its foundation was taken to a depth of approximately 4 ft (1.2 m). Although studies of the orientation of the failed blocks of the dam and other site evidence pointed to a sliding failure, no detailed quantitative studies have been done. Recent test pit excavations showed that the critical interface for sliding was a sandstone/shale contact located at a shallow depth below the base of the dam. Stability analyses based on shear-strength tests of the different interfaces of the foundation (concrete/sandstone, sandstone/sandstone, sandstone/shale, and shale/shale) showed that the dam was safe against a bearing capacity failure, but unsafe with respect to sliding and overturning. The lowest factor of safety of 0.6 corresponded to the sandstone/shale interface, as stated above. The major factors believed to have contributed to the failure include low shear strength of the foundation materials, inadequate provisions for reducing the uplift pressure, and weak concrete. The project stands as the sixth worst dam failure in U.S. history in terms of loss of life, and this case history provides numerous lessons with regard to dam safety.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-16444362538

The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set is used to describing the uncertainty and fuzziness between heterogeneous information. Evidence theory is employed to integrate the data from heterogeneous information. Finally, a multiple-arch dam undergoing structural reinforcement is taken as an example. The evaluation result before reinforcement shows that the safety degree of the dam is low and the potential risk is more likely to be located at the dam section #13. From the geological survey before reinforcement, there exist weak fracture zone and broken mud belt in the foundation of the dam section #13.

Turbid seepage flow is often observed on the downstream slope of a natural dam in the field and indicates the migration of fine particles in the dam. However, the coupling of internal erosion and seepage in natural dams during the impounding process is still unclear. This paper studies fine particles migration in a dam and the slope failure mode in the laboratory. Then, a coupling model was proposed with the fines migration equation, unsaturated seepage flow equation, and local stability analysis equation. In addition to the variation in the permeability coefficient due to fine particles migration, the strength parameters and density of the soil are also changed, which is considered in the model. Based on the conditions of the laboratory tests, simulations were conducted with the coupling model, and some parameters, such as pore pressure, porosity, principle stress, and factor of safety, were analyzed. Meanwhile, the influence of internal erosion and seepage on the stability of dams under different conditions is studied. Furthermore, the influence of some model parameters on the internal structure of the dam and its stability are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Through an analysis of the factors influencing landslide dam development and utilization, an index system (consisting of target, rule, and index layers) for evaluating development feasibility was constructed in this paper. Considering uncertainty and randomness in development feasibility evaluation, a cloud model-improved evaluation method was proposed to determine membership and score clouds based on the uncertainty reasoning of cloud model, and a cloud model-improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP-Cloud Model) was introduced to obtain weights. Final evaluation results were obtained using a hierarchical weighted summary. The improved method was applied to evaluate the Hongshiyan and Tangjiashan landslide dams and the results were compared with the maximum membership principle results. The results showed that the cloud model depicted the fuzziness and uncertainty in the evaluation process. The improved method proposed in this paper overcame the loss of fuzziness in the maximum membership principle evaluation results, and was capable of more directly presenting evaluation results. The development feasibility of the Hongshiyan landslide dam was relatively high, while that of the Tangjiashan landslide dam was relatively low. As suggested by these results, the evaluation model proposed in this paper has great significance for preparing a long-Term management scheme for landslide dams. © 2021 Public Library of Science.
