The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle. Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis, awareness raising and education and training are important activities to address the challenges of BIM usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881611317

The dynamic loadings due to train and track interactions redistribute from the rails to the rail pad, from the rail pad to the railway sleeper, and from the railway sleeper to the underlying ground. Dynamic content redistributed onto each layer of track is also filtered by energy dissipation characteristic of materials and structures. As a critical infrastructure, railway turnout is a structural grillage system used to divert a train to other directions or other tracks. The wheel-rail contact over the crossing transfer zone often causes detrimental impact loads that rapidly deteriorate the turnout and its components. The dynamic responses of wheel-rail interaction depend largely on the non-smooth trajectory or wearing condition of crossing geometry. In reality, a railway line spreads over a large distance and monitoring such rail infrastructure is one of the challenges in rail industry.

A traditional turnout system consists of steel rails, switches, crossings, steel plates, fasteners, screw spikes, timber bearers, ballast and formation. The wheel rail contact over the crossing transfer zone has a dip-like shape and can often cause detrimental impact loads on the railway track and its components. The large impact also emits disturbing noises (either impact or ground-borne noise) to railway neighbors. In a brown-field railway track where an existing aged infrastructure requires renewal or maintenance, some physical constraints and construction complexities may dominate the choice of track forms or certain components. With the difficulty to seek for high-quality timbers with dimensional stability, a methodology to replace aged timber bearers in harsh dynamic environments is to adopt an alternative material that could mimic responses and characteristics of timber in both static and dynamic loading conditions. A critical review has suggested an application of an alternative material called fibre-reinforced foamed urethane (FFU). The full-scale capacity design makes use of its comparable engineering characteristics to timber, high-impact attenuation, high damping property, and a longer service life. A field trial to investigate in-situ behaviours of a turnout grillage system using an alternative material, 'fibre-reinforced foamed urethane (FFU)' bearers, has been carried out at a complex turnout junction under heavy mixed traffics at Hornsby, New South Wales, Australia. The turnout junction was renewed using the FFU bearers altogether with new special track components. Influences of the FFU bearers on track geometry (recorded by track inspection vehicle 'AK Car'), track settlement (based on survey data), track dynamics, and acoustic characteristics have been measured. Operational train pass-by measurements have been analysed to evaluate the effectiveness of the replacement methodology. Comparative studies show that the use of FFU bearers generates higher rail and sleeper accelerations but the damping capacity of the FFU help suppress vibration transferring onto other track components. The survey data analysis suggests a small vertical settlement and negligible lateral movement of the turnout system. The static and dynamic behaviours of FFU bearers appear to equate that of natural timber but its service life is superior. © 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911110476

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

The applications were often aimed at understanding safety and reliability of railway systems through various basic principles and unique inference algorithms focusing on particular railway infrastructures. One of the most critical engineering infrastructure, railway turnouts (RTs) have been investigated and analysed critically in order to develop a new BN-based model with unique algorithm. This unprecedented study reveals the causal relations between primary causes and the subsystem failures, resulting in derailment, as a result of extreme weather-related conditions. In addition, the model, which is designed for rare events, has been proposed to identify the probability and underlying root cause of derailment. Consequently, it is expected that various weather-related causes of derailment at RTs, one such undesirable event, which can result, albeit rarely, damaging rolling stock, railway infrastructure and disrupting service, and having the potential to cause casualties and even loss of life, are identified to allow for smooth railway operation by rail industry itself.

Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years.

There are two types of support structures, which can be designed to be either a slab or a cluster of discrete bearers or sleepers.

This study was prompted by the industry's need to systemically estimate greenhouse gas emissions from railway construction and maintenance activities. In this paper, the emphasis is placed on plain-line railway maintenance and renewal projects. The objective of this study was to reduce the uncertainties and assumptions of previous studies based on ballasted track maintenance and renewal projects. A field-based data collection was carried out on plain-line ballasted track renewals. The results reveal that the emissions from the materials contribute more than nine times the CO2-e emissions than the machines used in the renewal projects. The results show that extending the lifespan of rail infrastructure assets through maintenance is beneficial in terms of reducing CO2-e emissions. Analysis was then carried out using the field data. Then the results were compared to two ballastless track alternatives. The results show that CO2-e emissions per metre from ballasted track were the least overall, however, the maintenance CO2-e emissions are greater than those of ballastless tracks over the infrastructure lifespan, with ballasted track maintenance emitting more CO2-e emissions at the 30 and 60year intervals and the end of life when compared to the ballastless track types.

Therefore, it is crucial for the railway industry to sustain a reliable and efficient operation and eliminate safety concerns. Analysis of accidents caused by train derailment is highlighted as one of the most crucial steps in the risk management chain. Considering various operational environment, the analysis enables reduction in the occurrence of derailment and prevents derailments in the most cost-efficient manner, as a variety of different causes and their frequency and severity are determined. In this paper, the methodology includes gathering and analysis of information on major derailments occurring at the turnouts from the UK. The causes have been categorised and then prioritised in accordance with the proportion of train derailments occurring within each category. The research objective is to determine the proportion of train derailments at turnouts and provide a starting point for the detailed analysis. In short, the aim of the paper is firstly to understand which factors under which circumstances pose the greatest risk at turnouts, secondly to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between derailment severity and frequency and thirdly, to determine the characteristics that cause major derailment and compare results with the characteristics in mainlines. The review analyses train derailments in UK over the last 15 years and demonstrates that the overall number of derailments have declined gradually and most derailments have occurred in yards. The dominant causes are identified as operational failures and component faults during track-train interaction, and track geometry problems are also seen to have a significant impact on derailment at turnouts, particularly in shunting yards. Furthermore, literature-based recommendations are used to address the issues arising from risks. The research outcomes are expected to aid the rail industry in developing, evaluating, prioritizing and gaining different perspective of derailment at turnouts to efficiently improve transportation safety and also to open a new gate to better understand the existing risk on railway turnouts. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102113330

In reality, the railway turnout is commonly built on complex track geometry and graded terrain, which makes it one of the most unique and critical railway infrastructures. The physical constraints and complexity of turnout systems cause various risks and uncertainty in rail operations. This study critically analyses emerging geotechnical risks on turnout systems considering all aspects that can potentially result in impaired reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of the turnout systems. The annual derailment incidents have been evaluated to identify emerging risk factors. Not only do these incidents yield operational downtime and financial losses, but they also give rise to the casualties and sometimes the loss of lives across the world. In particular, the climate change risks on geotechnical aspects of the turnout systems have been highlighted. This paper thus presents how turnout components work as a system, the diversity of emerging risks considering natural hazards and global warming potential to the system.

This feature poses a substantial peril to rail users as it is considered a cause of derailment. In addition, derailment deals to financial losses due to operational downtimes and monetary compensations in case of death or injure. These are fundamental drivers to consider mitigating risks arising from poor risk management during design. Prevention through design (PtD) is a process that introduces tacit knowledge from industry professionals during the design process. There is evidence that Building Information Modelling (BIM) can help to mitigate risk since the inception of the project. BIM is considered an Information System (IS) were tacit knowledge can be stored and retrieved from a digital database making easy to take promptly decisions as information is ready to be analysed. BIM at the model element level entails working with 3D elements and embedded data, therefore adding a layer of complexity to the management of information along the different stages of the project and across different disciplines. In order to overcome this problem, the industry has created a framework for model progression specification named Level of Development (LOD). The paper presents an IDM based framework for design risk mitigation through code validation using the LOD. This effort resulted on risk datasets which describe graphically and non-graphically a rail turnout as the model progresses. Thus, permitting its inclusion within risk information systems. The assignment of an LOD construct to a set of data, requires specialised management and process related expertise. Furthermore, the selection of a set of LOD constructs requires a purpose based analysis. Therefore, a framework for LOD constructs implementation within the IDM for code checking is required for the industry to progress in this particular field. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033671720
