Along its evolutionary path, there has been increased recognition of the need for a crisper and more precise delineation of the foundational premises and specification of the axioms of S-D logic. It also has become apparent that a limitation of the current foundational premises/axioms is the absence of a clearly articulated specification of the mechanisms of (often massive-scale) coordination and cooperation involved in the cocreation of value through markets and, more broadly, in society. This is especially important because markets are even more about cooperation than about the competition that is more frequently discussed. To alleviate this limitation and facilitate a better understanding of cooperation (and coordination), an eleventh foundational premise (fifth axiom) is introduced, focusing on the role of institutions and institutional arrangements in systems of value cocreation: service ecosystems. Literature on institutions across multiple social disciplines, including marketing, is briefly reviewed and offered as further support for this fifth axiom. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937054179

To create places that facilitate and encourage walking, practitioners need an understanding of the specific characteristics of the built environment that correlate most strongly with walking. This article reviews evidence on the built environment correlates with walking. Method: Included in this review were 13 reviews published between 2002 and 2006 and 29 original studies published in 2005 and up through May 2006. Results were summarized based on specific characteristics of the built environment and transportation walking versus recreational walking. Results: Previous reviews and newer studies document consistent positive relations between walking for transportation and density, distance to nonresidential destinations, and land use mix; findings for route/network connectivity, parks and open space, and personal safety are more equivocal. Results regarding recreational walking were less clear. Conclusions: More recent evidence supports the conclusions of prior reviews, and new studies address some of the limitations of earlier studies. Although prospective studies are needed, evidence on correlates appears sufficient to support policy changes.

Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior. © 2002 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036321397

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

From this perspective, the contributions of B2B marketing (and other sub-disciplines) can be seen as applicable to 'mainstream' marketing. This generic, actor-to-actor (A2A) orientation, in turn, points toward a dynamic, networked and systems orientation to value creation.

It posits that services offer benefits through access or temporary possession, instead of ownership, with payments taking the form of rentals or access fees. This rental/access perspective offers a different lens through which to view services.

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems.

The objectives are to investigate theory and practices of boundary management; to examine how boundary management operates on engineering construction projects; and to produce a research agenda for studying further, important aspects of boundary management impacting on engineering construction projects. Conclusions are that the emerging theories provide insights but it is the nature of the markets-notably, the diverse objectives of stakeholders and the procedures and their practices in pursuit of self-oriented benefits-which are the main impediments to achieving greater coordination and collaboration.

The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086995372

Both the link and the virtual representation can be realized in several different ways. However, the ambiguous meanings associated with the term digital twin are causing unnecessary miscommunications as people have different interpretations of what can be accomplished with it. To provide clarity around the concept, we introduce a general approach to analyze and construct digital twins in various applications. We identify the common features of digital twins from earlier literature and propose an analysis method that compares digital twin instances based on these features. The method is used to verify the existence of the features and can be further enhanced. We formulate the observations to a feature-based digital twin framework (FDTF) to universally define and structure digital twins. The framework consists of three main principles: i) the idea that all digital twins consist of a definite set of features, ii) the features can be used to compare digital twin instances to each other, and iii) the features can be combined via a data link feature to construct future digital twins more efficiently. As key contributions, we found that the features can be identified in existing digital twin implementations and the feature combinations of the implementations are diverse. We suggest that the features should be leveraged to provide clarity and efficiency in digital twin discussion and implementation. We further propose a general procedure for building digital twins. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077802084

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema. A case study using part of an office building and the results of its analysis are provided and discussed from the perspectives of applicability and accuracy.

In order to optimize movement paths that emerge during the simulated operation of such a virtual factory, a Digital Twin of a factory has to include a navigation framework that supports movements for humans, as well as autonomous robots. One possible foundation for such a framework are Building Information Models that include details about the buildings' 3D geometry and semantic annotations. In this publication, we propose a framework that allows for effortless inclusion of Building Information Models and factory equipment as well as a plugin system for a variety of spatial representations (e.g. regular grids or navigation meshes). © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044445847

To cope with these challenges, vendors are forming partnerships with other firms to access and leverage new and complementary resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Building on prior work on two traditionally distinct literature streams - interfirm networks and software ecosystems - we theorize that structural characteristics of a software vendor's partner network can influence its firm value. Specifically, we argue and find empirical support that partner network size, interconnectedness, and diversity impact firm value, measured by market capitalization for publicly listed firms and total funding for privately held firms, and that the association between structure and firm value differs by vendor type (legacy versus cloud-native). We explore these associations using a data-driven ecosystem analysis of 5429 firms, apply text analytic methods to differentiate vendors by technology stack focus (infrastructure, platform, software), and complement our empirical analyses with visualizations of the collaborative structure of the cloud computing ecosystem. We conclude with theoretical, methodological, and managerial implications. © 2018 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050969223

It is executed by hardware and interacts with its environment. So-called software systems are complicated hierarchical systems. They are carefully engineered by competent engineers. In contrast, complex systems, like biological ecosystems, railway systems and the Internet itself, have never been developed and tested as a whole by a team of engineers. Nevertheless, those complex systems have the ability to evolve without explicit control by anyone, and they are more robust to dealing with problems at the level of their constituent elements than classical engineered systems. Consequently, in this article we introduce the concept of complex software ecosystems comprised of interacting adaptive software systems and human beings. Ecosystems achieve the demanded flexibility and dependability by means of a kind of higher-level regulatory system. Their equilibrium is continuously preserved through the appropriate balance between the self-adaptation and the self-control capabilities of an ecosystem's participants. We will outline a methodology to support the engineering of ecosystems by integrating a model- and constraint-based engineering approach and applying it during design- and runtime. The open-world semantics of constraints establish a framework for the behavior of the participants and the ecosystem itself. Violations of constraints can be identified during design time, but also provide knowledge transfer to runtime. Constraints are additionally monitored and enforced during runtime. Thus, we propose an evolutionary engineering approach covering the whole life-cycle for forever active complex software ecosystems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
