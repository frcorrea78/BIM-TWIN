They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

Consequently, electric utilities as incumbent actors face a massive challenge to find new ways of creating, delivering, and capturing value from renewable energy technologies. This study investigates utilities' business models for renewable energies by analyzing two generic business models based on a series of in-depth interviews with German utility managers. It is found that utilities have developed viable business models for large-scale utility-side renewable energy generation. At the same time, utilities lack adequate business models to commercialize small-scale customer-side renewable energy technologies.

This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach. © 2017 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017566936

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

It is important to design a fair pricing strategy for energy trading; however, it leads to a complicated problem particularly when multi-energy systems participating the energy trading. This study proposes a trading aiding tool, which is based on a Nash-type non-cooperative game model between residential and commercial prosumers with guaranteed trading fairness. The model is generalized considering commonly used energy supply technologies and various demand-side management measures. The energy cost for both residential and commercial prosumers can be minimized with fair pricing strategies for both electricity and heating trading. Compared to previous research, this study presents a more concise solution to determine the fair prices for multi-energy trading. Through the McCormick relaxation, the complex problem is linearized as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with significant improvement on computational efficiency. A case study is conducted in Shanghai, China, where a community is modeled as the residential prosumer and connected to the commercial prosumer including three commercial buildings. The results indicate that compared to two prosumers standing alone, enabling energy trading with fairness can achieve 4.9% cost saving; the fair-trading prices for electricity and heating are 0.090 $/kWhe and 0.015 $/kWhh, respectively. Overall, this study proposes an efficient tool to provide insights into optimal infrastructure designs, and further quantify the fair pricing and schedule of demand response during P2P energy trading. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078962304

Four of these business models are frequently adopted in China: the Share Savings Model, the Guaranteed Savings Model, the Energy-cost Trust Model and the Finance Lease Model. The choice of a suitable business model has been recognized as one of the most important factors in the effective implementation of EPC projects. In this paper, the selection of EPC business models is formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. When selecting an EPC business model, it is natural for decision-makers (DMs) to express their preferences/opinions in linguistic terms. Given the characteristics of EPC projects, taking DMs' psychological behavior into account is of considerable and realistic significance. TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) has been verified as an effective behavioral decision-making method. To address the problem of EPC business model selection, an extended TODIM method based on multi-granularity linguistic terms and entropy measure is proposed. The sensitivity and comparison analyses show that DMs' psychological behavior can affect the selection order with respect to the given EPC business models. One case of a real-life campus EPC project demonstrates that the validity and applicability of the proposed extended TODIM method for solving the EPC business model selection problem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009468569

We present a study of electricity and financial flows in ten ‘virtual’ Australian apartment buildings under a range of technical implementations and financial arrangements, using real load profiles and simulated generation profiles. Aggregation of diverse household and shared loads, either through an embedded network or ‘behind the meter’ of individual dwellings, can increase self-sufficiency and self-consumption of on-site generation compared to separate systems supplying common property or individual apartments. While embedded networks can enable access to more beneficial retail arrangements, behind the meter solutions may allow residents to avoid regulatory complexities and additional costs.

Sufficient measurement data is essential to predict and manage a building’s performance levels. Assessing energy performance of buildings at an urban scale requires even larger data samples in order to perform an accurate analysis at an aggregated level. However, data are not only expensive, but it can also be a real challenge for communities to acquire large amounts of real energy data. This is despite the fact that inadequate knowledge of a full population will lead to biased learning and the failure to establish a data pipeline. Thus, this paper proposes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that will produce synthetic building energy data. This method is tested on real datasets. The results show that the parameter estimates from the model are stable and close to the true values. The bivariate model gives better performance in classification accuracy. Synthetic data points generated by the models show a consistent representation of the real data.
