However, critics claim that it means many different things to different people. This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept. © 2017 The Author(s)",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029397642

To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice. © 2018 The Author(s)",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049346751

However, there is an absence of detailed scientific research or case studies dealing with the potential environmental benefits of prefabrication, particularly the embodied energy savings resulting from waste reduction and the improved efficiency of material usage. This paper aims to quantify the embodied energy of modular prefabricated steel and timber multi-residential buildings in order to determine whether this form of construction provides improved environmental performance over conventional concrete construction methods. Furthermore this paper assesses the potential benefits of reusability of materials, reducing the space required for landfill and need for additional resource requirements. An eight-storey, 3943 m 2 multi-residential building was investigated. It was found that a steel-structured prefabricated system resulted in reduced material consumption of up to 78% by mass compared to conventional concrete construction. However, the prefabricated steel building resulted in a significant increase (∼50%) in embodied energy compared to the concrete building. It was shown that there was significant potential for the reuse of materials in the prefabricated steel building, representing up to an 81% saving in embodied energy and 51% materials saving by mass. This form of construction has the potential to contribute significantly towards improved environmental sustainability in the construction industry. Crown Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A detailed model is also provided to estimate the volume of waste that is expected to be generated on the building site. The quantification of C&D waste volume, from the project stage, is essential for the building actors to properly plan and control its disposal. This quantification model has been developed by studying 100 dwelling projects, especially their bill of quantities, and defining three coefficients to estimate the demolished volume (CT), the wreckage volume (CR) and the packaging volume (CE).

It aims to innovate the entire chain of production, consumption, distribution and recovery of materials and energy according to a cradle to cradle vision. The awareness of increasing constraints on the availability of resources as well as the increasing demand for access to welfare and wellbeing by developing countries and social groups make it evident the need for new economic models capable to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use. In the last two decades a growing literature addressed the environmental and economic impacts of construction and demolition (C&D) sectors, with special focus on the production and management of its waste materials. This study reviews and organizes the recent literature within the framework of the CE to explore how its key principles (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) apply to the management of C&D waste (C&DW). The reviewed literature mainly focuses on changes of environmental impacts as a consequence of CE implementation. Impacts have been mainly quantified by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, under the adoption of different boundaries of analysis, although other economic and biophysical approaches were also applied to a minor extent. The final goal of this study is evaluating if the adoption of the CE framework is environmentally and economically sustainable, given that the recovery of waste materials requires investments of resources. Different type of barriers (economic, political, legislative, informative and managerial) as well as solutions and success factors for implementing an effective management of C&DW within a circular framework are also pointed out. Results show that in most cases the reuse/recycling of C&DW at the end-of-life of a building as well as the production of recycled products provide environmental and economic benefits. Nevertheless, the environmental and economic sustainability of CE framework is very site specific and depends on several factors such as the type of material, building elements, transport distances, economic and political context. Finally, several directions for future research have been proposed: increased LCA modelling for sustainability evaluation, a wider development of cleaner production strategies focused on circular design, and finally the adoption of a comprehensive accounting of input and output flows, in order to assign appropriate weights to flows and benefits that are most often disregarded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041839257

Despite the adoption of several waste management strategies, waste reduction to landfill continues seeming an insurmountable challenge. This paper explores factors impeding the effectiveness of existing waste management strategies, as well as strategies for reducing waste intensiveness of the construction industry. Drawing on series of semi structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading construction companies, this paper combines phenomenological approach with a critical review and analysis of extant literatures. Five broad categories of factors and practices are responsible for ineffectiveness of construction and demolition waste management strategies, which subsequently results in waste intensiveness of the industry. These include end of pipe treatment of waste, externality and incompatibility of waste management tools with design tools, atomism of waste management strategies, perceived or unexpected high cost of waste management, and culture of waste behaviour within the industry. To reduce waste intensiveness of the construction industry, the study suggests that six factors are requisites. These are tackling of waste at design stage, whole life waste consideration, compliance of waste management solutions with BIM, cheaper cost of waste management practice, increased stringency of waste management legislation and fiscal policies, and research and enlightenment. The proposed strategies are not only important for achieving low waste construction projects, they are important for reducing waste intensiveness of the construction.

This paper offers a quantitative study of Lean/Green integration focused on waste reduction techniques in manufacturing processes. The literature confirms the convergence of the concepts of Lean Manufacturing and Green Management. Specifically, Waste Reduction Techniques are considered one of the main areas of the overlap between the Lean and Green paradigms. This offers interesting possibilities for future research on the development of quantitative studies on Waste Reduction Techniques, especially for a solid waste minimization program in manufacturing. Using the Design of Experiments tool, the present study measures the influence of different methods, derived from both the Lean and Green approaches, on solid waste management performance. Based on these results, a hierarchy of progress factors for a waste minimization program in manufacturing is outlined: the 3R Hierarchy must be preferred to a deadly waste (muda) analysis and combining the 3R Hierarchy and the deadly wastes of Lean Management improves the performance of a waste minimization program in manufacturing. In addition, the use of a Lean/Green matrix —a check-list that integrates Lean and Green best practices— was shown to consistently increase the performance of a waste minimization plan and as a result, the impact on the waste reduction can be doubled. This work is of interest to practitioners because they can build upon this experience to implement a waste reduction program using a set of tools to monitor and measure the program's achievements, which can ultimately lead to balanced performance improvement in terms of environmental, social and economic dimensions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989903775

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and designers to analyse the implication of designs decision on the salvage performance of buildings over time.

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014878028

A qualitative approach is used to revisit the design, construction, and demolition stages of prefabricated buildings; in so doing, the circular-economy framework is applied to foster circular prefabricated modi operandi. Prefabrication of buildings can be divided into four entities: elements and components, panels (or non-volumetric elements), volumetric, and entire modules. Through an analysis of published research on how the circular economy can be applied to different industry sectors and production processes, seven strategies emerged, each of which revealed the potential of improving the circular economy of buildings. The first strategy is reduction of waste through a lean production chain. By reusing the waste, the second strategy investigates the use of by-products in the production of new components. The third strategy focuses on the reuse of replacement parts and components. The fourth strategy is based on design toward adaptability, respectively focusing on reusability of components and adapting components for a second use with a different purpose. Similarly, the fifth strategy considers the implications of designing for disassembly with Building Information Modeling so as to improve the end-of-life deconstruction phase. The sixth strategy focuses on design with attention to recyclability of used material. Finally, the seventh strategy considers the use of tracking technologies with embedded information on components' geometric and mechanic characteristics as well as their location and life cycle to enable second use after deconstruction. It is demonstrated that prefabricated buildings are key to material savings, waste reduction, reuse of components, and various other forms of optimization for the construction sector. By adopting the identified strategies in prefabricated buildings, a circular economy could be implemented within the construction industry.

Gypsum plasterboard is well suited for this, because the raw material calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) can repeatedly change its properties through a reversible hydration reaction. The waste hierarchy is applied when plasterboard is recycled instead of landfilled, which contributes to the European 2020 target of 70% recovery of construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste, as defined in the Directive 2008/98/EC on Waste. This paper evaluates the energy and climate impacts of different levels of plasterboard recycling. First, we formulate a life cycle model of gypsum mass flows in the European Union (EU-27) in the reference year 2013. This model constitutes the basis of the quantitative scenario analysis. Secondly, we assess the material flows, energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different recycling scenarios. We compare the current situation (""2013 base case"") to two scenarios: a worst case scenario of 0% recycled gypsum (""Zero recycling case""), and a best case scenario of zero gypsum waste sent to landfill, corresponding to 18.7% recycled gypsum in new plasterboard (""High recycling case""). We find no significant variation between scenarios in terms of life cycle energy use, as lower impacts from gypsum mining, transport of natural gypsum and final disposal in the best case scenario are balanced by the energy for the transport of plasterboard waste and recycled gypsum and for material pre-processing during manufacturing. In contrast, life cycle GHG emissions are lower as recycling increases, largely driven by the degradation of plasterboard lining paper in landfills. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to proposing a change in the architects' way of thinking, the climate change further requires an improvement in the environment, politics and social consciousness. The chase for sustainable architecture must also consider the end of the life cycles of materials. The aim of this work is to introduce new concepts regarding materials and building elements that reach the end of their first life cycle and to evaluate the potential for recyclability of those materials. The research method is based on a hierarchic upside down pyramid that gives priority to the reuse and recycling of materials and afterwards allows for the creation of recyclability levels of the materials and elements. The results show that the concepts created regarding recycled, infracycled, reused and infraused materials are more suitable to the current situation. The indexes of recyclability quantify the betterment of the environment in the construction processes of buildings that are made from recycled or recyclable materials.

A ""smart city"" is an urban development vision that integrates multiple information and communication technologies to manage the assets of a city, including its information systems, transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management systems, and other community services provided by a local department. The goal of creating a smart city is to improve the quality of life of citizens by using technology and by addressing the environmental, social, cultural, and physical needs of a society. Data modeling and data visualization are integral parts of planning a smart city, and planning professionals currently seek new methods for real-time simulations. The impact analysis of ""what-if scenarios"" frequently takes a significant amount of time and resources, and virtual reality (VR) is a potential tool for addressing these challenges. VR is a computer technology that replicates an environment, whether real or imagined, and simulates the physical presence and environment of a user to allow for user interaction. This paper presents a review of the capacity of VR to address current challenges in creating, modeling, and visualizing smart cities through material modeling and light simulation in a VR environment. This study can assist urban planners, stakeholders, and communities to further understand the roles of planning policies in creating a smart city, particularly in the early design stages.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) can facilitate CE decision-making by identifying the largest environmental impact reduction opportunities throughout a building's life cycle, but it does not suffice in a design situation. Thus, aggregated LCA knowledge is needed. However, existing building LCAs lack transparency, coherence and a closer coupling with the building context. Performing in-depth systematic LCA on four Danish case-study buildings (a school, an office, a residential building and a hospital), this study identifies where the largest embodied greenhouse gas emissions (EG) exist. The study also identifies which building design and construction strategies should be in focus in transitioning the building sector to a CE. The LCA generalisations found that all the buildings exhibited considerable EG originating from production and replacement of floors and ceilings, outer walls, inner walls and roofs. Thus, to come closer to meeting climate goals, a combination of different strategies going across and beyond the life cycles of buildings, components and materials is needed. These strategies include reusing existing buildings, components and materials; avoiding, substituting or reducing the use of EG-intensive and short-lived materials; and enabling future reuse, recycling and/or energy recovery options for materials. Differences between the buildings were also found. Thus, it is suggested to combine generalised learnings with LCA of buildings on a case-to-case basis, and to focus on optimising EG-intensive components and materials based on their different use-contexts and interconnectedness rather than on optimising the entire building. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092317785

Available research efforts tried to study and model the complex modular construction processes. However, they seemed to fall short in investigating modular construction processes in a comprehensive and holistic manner. In effect, the currently used decision-making models and processes for modular construction do not necessarily reflect the diverse and multiple interconnected and associated factors. This paper develops a comprehensive list of decision factors as well as determines future research needs for modular construction. As such, the authors (1) conducted a systematic literature review and analysis of modular construction studies that were conducted between 2009 and 2019, (2) highlighted the broad factors affecting decision-making in modular construction projects, and (3) utilized social network analysis (SNA) to quantitatively identify the literature gaps and strengths and create a roadmap for the factors that need further investigation.

Consequently, it was revealed that there are some understudied decision factors, including those related to legal and regulatory considerations, material and construction waste management, green practices, as well as commissioning and testing. Further, it was shown that there is an explicit absence of the decision models and frameworks that simultaneously incorporate all the identified decision factors.

This problem stifles quantity surveyors' capability to meet the demand for “value for money” (VfM) throughout sustainable building development. The purpose of this paper is to describe results from a case study of deploying a building product model on a commercial project in Ireland, with a view to easing the cost management duties of the quantity surveyor. The paper comprises a case study of the Environmental Research Institute project and a questionnaire survey of quantity surveying business in Ireland. Quantity surveying still encounters serious data compatibility problems in integrated teams because most software available on the market run proprietary file formats. It is concluded that there is a huge business potential for quantity surveying to facilitate designing to a budget within integrated teams, and that software interoperability could have a negative impact on professional fee structures, which could trigger more robust appraisal strategies for building products if quantity surveying is to maintain a leading role in providing cost management services to the construction industry.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to identify research trends and patterns in BAS. To achieve this aim, a systematic literature review of BAS was conducted using topic specific keywords to categorise and summarise relevant studies. A meta-analysis followed to quantify results from collected articles. The articles were categorised into the following groups: (a) building automation architecture, (b) benefits of building automation, and (c) motivations and interactions with occupants. The results of the systematic literature review are integrated into a new research framework that highlights the importance of integrative feedback loops. The novel research framework considers qualitative and quantitative system feedback loops, which can lead to an increase in occupant acceptance as well as an uptake of BAS for industry. © 2021",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102319497
