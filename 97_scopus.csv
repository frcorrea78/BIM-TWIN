This article reviews literature on this 'performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

Especially in dynamic environments, where the setting and occupancy keep changing, knowing occupancy information, including the number and identities of the occupants and where they are located, can be beneficial in energy management as well as other application areas including safety, security and emergency response. In particular, occupancy information has a direct impact on various aspects of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as heat loads, system running time, required heating, cooling and distribution of conditioned air, and preferred temperature set points. Energy-saving strategies can be carried out in response to real-time occupancy changes. In this paper, an RFID based occupancy detection system is proposed to support demand-driven HVAC operations by detecting and tracking multiple stationary and mobile occupants in multiple spaces simultaneously. The proposed system estimates the thermal zone where each occupant is located, and reports the number of occupants for each thermal zone in real time. The field tests yielded an average zone level detection accuracy of 88% for stationary occupants and 62% for mobile occupants. For scattering analysis, averages distances to corresponding centroids were 1.45 m and 3.24 m for stationary and mobile occupants, respectively. In order to explore the benefits of demand-driven HVAC operations, current HVAC work procedures are examined, major energy consumers in HVAC systems are identified and quantified, and energy-saving strategies are presented.

Among the various factors influencing building energy consumption, occupant behavior has drawn increasing attention. Occupant behavior includes occupant presence, movement, and interaction with building energy devices and systems. However, there are gaps in occupant behavior modeling as different energy modelers have employed varied data and tools to simulate occupant behavior, therefore producing different and incomparable results. Aiming to address these gaps, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy in Buildings and Community (EBC) Programme Annex 66 has established a scientific methodological framework for occupant behavior research, including data collection, behavior model representation, modeling and evaluation approaches, and the integration of behavior modeling tools with building performance simulation programs.

Kano's satisfaction model, developed originally in the context of marketing, is adapted and tested for its suitability in the context of building occupants' satisfaction. Analyses were conducted on the occupant survey database from Center for the Built Environment (CBE) to estimate individual impacts of 15 IEQ factors on occupants' overall satisfaction, depending on the building's performance in relation to those IEQ factors. These empirical analyses identified nonlinearities between some IEQ factors and occupant satisfaction; some IEQ factors had a predominantly negative impact on occupants' overall satisfaction when the building underperformed.

Occupancy and occupant behavior, which refer to human presence inside buildings and their active interactions with various building system such as lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, window blinds, and plugs, attract great attention of research with regard to better building design and operation. Due to the stochastic nature of occupant behavior, prior occupancy models vary dramatically in terms of data sampling, spatial and temporal resolution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current modeling efforts of occupant behavior, summarizes occupancy models for various applications including building energy performance analysis, building architectural and engineering design, intelligent building operations and building safety design, and presents challenges and areas where future research could be undertaken. In addition, modeling requirement for different applications is analyzed. Furthermore, a few commonly used statistical and data mining models are presented.

This study investigated whether employee ""satisfaction"" variables can predict perceived productivity, well-being and enjoyment at work, and if so, to what extent. The study also explored whether limiting employees' control over their environment could save energy without compromising employees' satisfaction and perceived productivity. Pre-occupancy and post-occupancy evaluation studies were conducted, in terms of both energy consumption and employee perceptions, to make comparisons between a company's old and current headquarters buildings, both located in the same area of London.The results showed that employees were more satisfied with their work environment at their new HQ, in general, than with that of their previous office. Also, employees' self-reported productivity, well-being and enjoyment at work improved after the move. It was revealed that the combination of employees' level of satisfaction with ""interior use of space"" and ""physical conditions"" was the best predictor of their perceived productivity, while satisfaction with ""indoor facilities"" was not a good predictor. In terms of energy performance, although the new HQ's energy consumption per m2 was significantly less than that of the previous building, there was still a gap between the refurbishment design target and the actual performance of the building. The findings suggest that this gap could be due to a number of factors, including an ineffective use of interior space, and occupants' behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883422361

Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed.

These accumulated data have the potential to provide deep information that can help improve facility management. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

However, providing feedback in commercial and educational buildings is challenging because of the difficulty in tracking occupants' behaviors and their corresponding energy usage - especially for temporary occupants. To make providing such feedback possible in commercial and educational buildings, this paper presents the framework for a coupled system that uses residents' wireless devices' Wi-Fi connection and disconnection events to detect occupancy and then benchmarks energy loads against these events to monitor the energy use of occupants. A preliminary experiment implemented the proposed approach in a small-scale educational building to ascertain whether Wi-Fi network connection/disconnection events can be an effective indicator of energy load variation. The experiment's results confirmed the positive relationship between the Wi-Fi connection events and energy load increase; these results also indicated that the number of Wi-Fi connections cannot directly represent the magnitude of the energy load. A validation test was also conducted to assess the robustness of the coupled system in terms of the impact of users' schedules (AM/PM), their length of stay (long-term/temporary), and the locations of access points. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Appropriate service based on actual occupant demand could prevent unnecessary energy waste caused by system overcooling or overheating. Therefore, various occupancy detection approaches had attracted increasing attentions in recent years.

Compared with traditional request and response based occupancy assessment, the newly developed Wi-Fi probe technology can actively scan Wi-Fi enabled devices even if they are not connected to the network. However, Wi-Fi probe detection still subjects to significant errors due to unstable signal and unpredictable occupant behavior.

Central to this monitoring study is the Wi-Fi based indoor positioning system based on the measured Wi-Fi devices' number and locations and data mining methods. Distinct from traditional occupancy and energy studies, more detailed information related to the indoor positions and number of occupants has offered a better understanding of building user behaviour. The implication of the occupancy patterns for energy (e.g. lighting and other building services) efficiency is assessed, assisted with data from lighting sensors where needed. It is found occupancy patterns change dramatically with time. Also, the energy waste patterns have been identified through the method of data association rule mining. If the identified energy waste is removed, the total energy consumption can be reduced by 26.1%.

It was introduced as the working mechanism that formed the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain extensive mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. It was evident that the underlying principles characteristic of BCT functional attributes and secure digital infrastructure could find application in nearly any conceivable industry.

However, PIR sensors are motion detectors in nature, responding only to incident radiation variation, which leads to false negative detections, inaccurate occupancy estimation, and uncomfortable lighting swings and waste of energy. To address this issue, an optical shutter driven by a Lavet motor PIR (LAMPIR) sensor is developed for true presence detection. In comparison with our previously developed chopped PIR (C-PIR) and rotationally chopped PIR (Ro-PIR) sensors, a low-power single-phase electro-mechanical driving approach is introduced for LAMPIR to replace traditional servo and stepper motors and thus significantly reduce the power consumption by up to 89%, size by up to 60%, weight by up to 75%, cost by up to 31%, and acoustic noise by 12 dBA. More specifically, driven by pulsed signal from a microcontroller unit, the electro-mechanical vibrator drives a semi-Transparent long-wave infrared optical shutter to chop the field of view (FOV) of a PIR sensor periodically. By monitoring and analyzing the voltage outputs generated by the LAMPIR senor, high-Accuracy presence detection can be achieved by optimizing the shutter width and shuttering period through parametric studies. Experimental results show that a classification accuracy of 100% can be reached for detecting stationary occupants up to 4.5 m and moving occupants up to 10 m, suggesting a detection range improvement from both the C-PIR and the Ro-PIR sensors (4.0 m for stationary and 8.0 m for moving occupancy detection for both sensors). Additionally, the LAMPIR sensor has an FOV of 90° in horizontal and 100° in vertical, which is sufficient for most applications. For a 31-h-long presence detection test, an accuracy of 97% is achieved when classifying unoccupied and occupied scenarios, while an accuracy of 93% is achieved when classifying unoccupied, stationary and moving occupant scenarios. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054623119

Reported cases of BIM adoption to support facilities management and lifecycle management reveals that the implementation of BIM for FM processes is, in general, limited to an experimental scale. Even large public owners who have been using BIM for managing their construction projects have not implemented it into their FM activities. Therefore, there is little evidence of the benefits of BIM in the operational phase. In addition, the challenges involved in shifting from traditional FM processes to new BIM-based processes are not well known. In this paper we document some of the issues involved in the adoption of BIM in FM and identify some applications, metrics and benefits related to its adoption.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform. The demonstrator also includes two applications: (1) improving asset maintenance and asset tracking using Augmented Reality (AR); and (2) equipment failure prediction. The long-term goals of this demonstrator are also discussed in this paper. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085260931

We attempt to address the occupancy counting challenge in educational building deployment scenario with large groups of people entering and leaving. Experiments have been conducted for three months with five-minute data reporting interval. The results show that the PTZ-camera based face recognition has the most stable and highest accuracy with an R2 of 0.972; followed by the CO2 based statistical model with an R2 of 0.938. Discussion and improvements on the methods are discussed. A final hybrid model is proposed by using the estimated occupancy by the PTZ face detection algorithm to train the CO2 model.

Although building automation systems and advanced control strategies aim to address this issue by improving adaptability to partial occupancy, no holistic metrics exist to quantify this aspect of building performance. To this end, we present a technology-independent approach to define adaptability as a building performance attribute and introduce metrics to quantify it. These metrics can be used to evaluate how different building technologies and control strategies influence building operations’ adaptability to variable occupancy or estimate their associated energy savings. To demonstrate these metrics, a case study based on simulating a single-story office building was used to compare several control strategies with regards to their effect on improving adaptability. Results showed how the proposed metrics highlighted the additional benefits of these control strategies, especially under low-occupancy scenarios. Performance-based compliance with building energy codes and standards typically assumes full or near full occupancy, which may underestimate the benefits of adaptable building technologies or controls. Therefore, incorporating adaptability metrics in energy codes and operational guidelines would quantify the benefits of adaptable systems, especially under variable occupancy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063632180

A reliable and accurate occupancy detection technique should be available for estimating the demand. To this, many occupancy detection methods have been developed either based on physical sensors, cameras or information & communication technology (ICT). Wi-Fi based detection is one of the ICTs that uses Wi-Fi signals (e.g. from smartphones) to represent occupants. Nowadays, new smartphone models all have the battery-saving function that will switch off Wi-Fi communication in the idle mode, causing significant detection uncertainties. This challenge has not been addressed in the current Wi-Fi based occupancy detection methods that still assume or manipulate a continuous Wi-Fi communication. Moreover, most studies are conducted in relatively simple settings with small-scale occupancy that are far from a complex indoor space. Thus, this study investigates the Wi-Fi based occupancy detection in a complex indoor space with large occupancy. An event-triggered updating method is proposed to cater for the discontinuity in Wi-Fi communication of the smartphones. A location filter and a non-human media access control (MAC) address filter are proposed to screen out irrelevant Wi-Fi devices. The proposed event-triggered updating method is able to improve the detection accuracy from 77.3% to 96.8%. The proposed location filter and non-human MAC address filter prove to be effective in removing irrelevant outside and non-human devices. The proposed event-triggered updating method can be applied to existing installations with minimum cost regardless of the Wi-Fi communication continuity. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060850709

The purpose of this paper is to bring these sources of data together, to provide a more complete account of a building and, consequently, a more comprehensive basis for understanding and managing its performance. Design/methodology/approach: Building data from a sample of newly constructed housing units were analysed, several properties were identified for the study and sensors deployed. A sensor agnostic platform for visualising real-time building performance data was developed. Findings: Data sources from both sensor data and qualitative questionnaire were analysed and a matrix of elements affecting building performance in areas such as energy use, comfort use, integration with technology was presented. In addition, a prototype sensor visualisation platform was designed to connect in-use performance data to BIM. Originality/value: This work presents initial findings from a post occupancy evaluation utilising sensor data. The work attempts to address the issues of BIM in-use scenarios for housing sector. A prototype was developed which can be fully developed and replicated to wider housing projects.

The solution, called 3i buildings - Intelligent, Interactive, and Immersive Buildings, is a tool to monitor and manage smart buildings, as well as optimize users experience, energy consumptions and environment quality. This is achieved by a grid of sensors and devices that continuously gather information (structural conditions of the building, occupancy, comfort of occupants, energy consumptions and CO2, COV's and Humidity levels, etc.), which is processed by predictive models able to learn over time. The 3D representation of the models allows managers to take advantage of the virtual environment, by augmenting the facility model and including information about the facility, making it easier and perceptible to users and owners, helping them to make better decisions. To support our research, the system will be installed in three different environments, Luz's hospital, Lisbon Aquarium and Norte Shopping, to test the solution under different conditions, objectives and users. In the first two cases the objectives are to monitor building air quality, consumptions and occupancy and in the Norte Shopping case the objectives are to monitor people flows, interact with tem and help the response in case of crisis according to the adopted emergency plan. These types of systems might help reducing energy consumptions as well as increasing comfort and satisfaction of occupants, maintaining a constant concentration of CO2 and humidity within the facility.
