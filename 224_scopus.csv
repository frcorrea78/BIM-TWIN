RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing. © 1981, ACM. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019574599

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF's application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF's usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049174575

In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter.

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases.

This paper reviews the recent advances of airborne LiDAR systems and the use of LiDAR data for DEM generation, with special focus on LiDAR data filters, interpolation methods, DEM resolution, and LiDAR data reduction. Separating LiDAR points into ground and non-ground is the most critical and difficult step for DEM generation from LiDAR data. Commonly used and most recently developed LiDAR filtering methods are presented. Interpolation methods and choices of suitable interpolator and DEM resolution for LiDAR DEM generation are discussed in detail. In order to reduce the data redundancy and increase the efficiency in terms of storage and manipulation, LiDAR data reduction is required in the process of DEM generation. Feature specific elements such as breaklines contribute significantly to DEM quality. Therefore, data reduction should be conducted in such a way that critical elements are kept while less important elements are removed.

The eigenanalysis is first carried out for each roof point of a building within its Voronoi neighborhood. Such analysis not only yields the surface normal for each lidar point but also separates the lidar points into planar and nonplanar ones. In the second step, the surface normals of all planar points are clustered with the fuzzy k-means method. To optimize this clustering process, a potential-based approach is used to estimate the number of clusters, while considering both geometry and topology for the cluster similarity. The final step of segmentation separates the parallel and coplanar segments based on their distances and connectivity, respectively. Building reconstruction starts with forming an adjacency matrix that represents the connectivity of the segmented planar segments. A roof interior vertex is determined by intersecting all planar segments that meet at one point, whereas constraints in the form of vertical walls or boundary are applied to determine the vertices on the building outline. Finally, an extended boundary regularization approach is developed based on multiple parallel and perpendicular line pairs to achieve topologically consistent and geometrically correct building models.

This approach involves a 3D modeling stage and the integration of the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further management and analysis. The modeling stage is carried out using a new concept; Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) which has been developed at the Dublin Institute of Technology [12]. Historic Building Information Modeling is a system for modeling historic structures from laser scan and photogrammetric data using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded scripting language within the BIM software called Geometric Descriptive Language (GDL). These objects are combined and mapped onto the survey data to build the entire model. After the 3D model has been created the next stage involves integrating the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further analysis. The international framework for 3D city modeling, CityGML has been adopted for this purpose. CityGML provides an interoperable framework for modeling 3D geometries, semantics, topology and appearance properties [13]. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between parametric CAD modeling and 3D GIS while using benefits from both systems to help document and analyze cultural heritage sites. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872036464

Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a very useful data source for acquiring detailed geometric and topological information of building objects. In this study, we employed a graph-based method based on hierarchical structure analysis of building contours derived from LiDAR data to reconstruct urban building models. The proposed approach first uses a graph theory-based localized contour tree method to represent the topological structure of buildings, then separates the buildings into different parts by analyzing their topological relationships, and finally reconstructs the building model by integrating all the individual models established through the bipartite graph matching process. Our approach provides a more complete topological and geometrical description of building contours than existing approaches. We evaluated the proposed method by applying it to the Lujiazui region in Shanghai, China, a complex and large urban scene with various types of buildings. The results revealed that complex buildings could be reconstructed successfully with a mean modeling error of 0.32 m.

However, ML methods require large volumes of quality training datasets and in the case of supervised ML, manual input is usually required for labelling those datasets. Such an approach is expensive, prone to errors and labour as well as time-intensive, especially in a highly complex and dynamic production environment. DT models can be utilized for accelerating the training phase in ML by creating suitable training datasets as well as by automatic labelling via the simulation tools chain and thus alleviating user’s involvement during training. These synthetic datasets can be enhanced and cross-validated with real-world information which is not required to be extensive. A framework for implementing the proposed DT-driven approach for developing ML models is presented. The proposed framework has been implemented in an industrially relevant use case.

It is a central repository of BIM data and examples include 4BIM and Autodesk 360. These repositories have some disadvantages:(i) it is after synchronisation or file upload that changes between local and cloud versions of BIM models can be appreciated by remote teams; (ii) there is a cost associated with subscribing to these servers, which could marginalise SMEs wanting to adopt BIM; and (iii) during the design phase, these systems do not permit real-time co-creation capabilities or audiovisual consensus amongst designers. So although these repositories are helpful technologies, it is people who collaborate (not systems) and in the design phase, audio-visual feedback and consensus can augment the collaboration experience and outcomes. With socio-technical input, the quality of BIM data/models generated by team members can be enhanced (and clashes minimised) if visual isolation is eliminated. This research presents a framework and proof-of-concept which redefines Social BIM (SBIM) as a socio-technical mode of BIM that enriches the co-creation process for Levels 2 and 3 BIM. It enables 'shared situational awareness' by empowering remote participants with visual and remote control of BIM models using GoToMeeting as a 'groupware'.

Solving this problem is a necessary prerequisite for many indoor applications, including navigation, augmented reality and building scanning. The main challenges include dealing with noisy and low-frequency depth data and managing limited computational and memory resources. State of the art approaches in large-scale dense reconstruction require large amounts of memory and high-performance GPU computing. Other existing 3D reconstruction approaches on mobile devices either only build a sparse reconstruction, offload their computation to other devices, or require long post-processing to extract the geometric mesh. In contrast, we can reconstruct and render a global mesh on the fly, using only the mobile device’s CPU, in very large (300 m2) scenes, at a resolutions of 2–3 cm. To achieve this, we divide the scene into spatial volumes indexed by a hash map. Each volume contains the truncated signed distance function for that area of space, as well as the mesh segment derived from the distance function. This approach allows us to focus computational and memory resources only in areas of the scene which are currently observed, as well as leverage parallelization techniques for multi-core processing.

On the other hand, many Digital Terrain Models (DTM) have been created as 2.5D triangular irregular networks (TIN) or grids for different applications such as water management, sign of view or shadow computation, tourism, land planning, telecommunication, military operations and communications. 3D city models need to represent both the 3D objects and terrain in one consistent model, but still many challenges remain. A critical issue when integrating 3D objects and terrain is the identification of the valid intersection between 2.5D terrain and 3D objects. Commonly, 3D objects may partially float over or sink into the terrain; the depth of the underground parts might not be known; or the accuracy of data sets might be different. This paper discusses some of these issues and presents an approach for a consistent 3D reconstruction of LOD1 models on the basis of 3D point clouds, DTM, and 2D footprints of buildings. Such models are largely used for urban planning, city analytics or environmental analysis. The proposed method can be easily extended for higher LODs or BIM models. © Authors 2019.

The technique may be useful for routine inventory and rapid volume estimation of complex LW structures that tend to divert or obstruct flow in rivers. Our methodology is validated by means of laboratory experiments, ranging from elementary to complex arrangements of LW components and organic fine material (OFM). Seven experimental setups were used as the basis for (i) manual approximations of 2.5D and 3D geometric reference volumes, (ii) 2.5D volume models based on mesh geometry, (iii) a closed (‘watertight’) 3D mesh from an unorganized point cloud and (iv) estimates of porosity. A commercially available SfM photogrammetry software package, Pix4Dmapper, was used for point cloud and simplified mesh generation. In order to obtain more precise volumes, 3D surface models are required. Accordingly, we generated 3D watertight mesh models of the unorganized point cloud using the screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction (PSR) technique. The Pix4D volume tool (2.5D) resulted in an overestimation (2.9 to 52.7%) of the geometric volume (3D), due to the convex hull approximation of the geometry normal to the surface plane. PSR (3D) resulted in more precise volumes, showing deviations from the geometric volume (3D) in a range of −15.9 to +10.6%, as the algorithm could capture concavities and involuted surfaces on the accumulation. Assuming that the difference between 3D and 2.5D volume models represents many of the voids visible within or on the surface of the deposit, this volume can be used as an estimate of porosity. Our assessment suggests that image-based SfM methodology is well-suited for further investigations in LW research, due to its time and cost efficiency in comparison with other conventional surveying techniques. The methodology can be used to generate high quality point cloud and mesh models of log jam formations; these may be used by river managers and researchers to quantify accumulation volume and thus gain a better understanding of LW composition and the influence of wood geometry on hydraulic flow conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076256306

However, their nature hinders the direct extraction and sharing of underlying information. The generation of consistent large-scale 3D city models from this real-world data is a major challenge. Specifically, the integration in workflows usable by decision-making scenarios demands that the data is structured, rich and exchangeable. CityGML permits new advances in terms of interoperable endeavour to use city models in a collaborative way. Efforts have led to render good-looking digital twins of cities but few of them take into account their potential use in finite elements simulations (wind, floods, heat radiation model, etc.). In this paper, we target the automatic reconstruction of consistent 3D city buildings highlighting closed solids, coherent surface junctions, perfect snapping of vertices, etc. It specifically investigates the topological and geometrical consistency of generated models from aerial LiDAR point cloud, formatted following the CityJSON specifications. These models are then usable to store relevant information and provides geometries usable within complex computations such as computational fluid dynamics, free of local inconsistencies (e.g. holes and unclosed solids). © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091107933

A simulation framework using ROS and Gazebo has been implemented to compare different methods based on LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM). The featureless environments typically found in interiors of commercial and industrial buildings pose significant challenges for LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks, resulting in drift or breakdown of the processes. The results from this paper provide performance criteria for indoor SLAM applications, comparing different room topologies and levels of clutter.
