They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339863

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019987476

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle.

The study also aims to formulate a conceptual framework of the different stages in the adoption process identify gaps in the existing literature and to provide a holistic picture of contemporary research in technology adoption in construction research literature. Design/methodology/approach - A generic framework is initially proposed containing the fundamental concepts of ""pre-adoption"", ""adoption"" and ""post-adoption"". The review separates the literature according to three key perspectives: ""socio-economic""; ""managerial""; and ""psychological"". The applicability of the existing approaches to the construction context is discussed, and then a new conceptual framework for construction is developed. Findings - Significant gaps in the understanding of construction technology adoption are identified that provide an interesting agenda for future research. A Construction Technology Adoption Framework is presented, which draws together all of sub-processes involved in technology adoption. This framework covers key activities of both the vendor and the customer. Research limitations/implications - The study has been restricted to information technologies and construction equipment technology. Other construction technologies, such as formwork systems, have not been examined. Practical implications - The new framework provides a direction for research into the technology adoption process including key sub-processes and potential research areas. The framework also assists vendors to influence customers' decision-making processes, and guides new customers in setting up their own decision procedures. Originality/value - This paper departs from earlier research by focusing on information and equipment technology adoption rather than innovation adoption in general. In addition, this paper considers both sides of the adoption equation (vendor and customer), which is in contrast to previous binary studies which considered one side or the other. It delineates the boundaries of different concepts such as diffusion, adoption, acceptance and implementation, which have been interchangeably used in previous studies.

However, coverage of the theory of BIM diffusion (which combines contextual and technical issues of the applications) remains scant and underdeveloped. Compatibility is one of the key contextual factors of Diffusion of Innovation theory that involves predicting BIM adopters' behaviours and identifying what components require extra effort for successful BIM implementation. However, this important theoretical concept has not been developed in pertinent BIM literature nor used correctly to extend existing knowledge because compatibility variables are not understood in a construction context. This seriously impedes the correct usage of BIM in construction. This study systematically and critically reviews BIM compatibility (BIM-COM) literature to distinguish compatibility issues at the organisational level and the concept of interoperability at the technical level. A sample of 57 out of the 131 articles constituted secondary data and each paper represented the unit of analysis. Bibliographic analysis techniques were used to identify co-authoring network and contents' concentration in the created bibliography. Content analysis and text mining approaches were employed using a thematic clustering analysis for grouping authors and themes within articles. The findings illustrate that the concept of compatibility is surprisingly poorly understood and often overlooked in the literature. The paper argues that interoperability issues prevail as the key practical barrier to BIM implementation. The paper identifies a large knowledge gap in terms of improving compatibility measures, which should be employed by innovators to assess their BIM applications before they offer it to construction companies. The findings presented will help to extend BIM applications and speed up the adoption rate among stakeholders with different needs and using different file formats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078567856

Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin-enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio. Temporally segmented energy benchmarking measures generated from smart meter data streams are a critical step for integrating smart meter analytics with building energy benchmarking techniques, and for conducting smarter energy management across a large geographic scale of buildings. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075830608

In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT. DT is a virtual and authoritative representation of physical manufacturing resource, since DT includes various models and manufacturing big data of resource. The proposed architecture is illustrated in detail as follows: (1) physical layer, (2) network layer, (3) virtual layer, and (4) application layer. A case of expert fault diagnose for aircraft engine is presented using the proposed information fusion in the architecture. Secondly, this paper proposes an approach of information modeling for CPPS based on AutomationML. Various manufacturing services can be encapsulated and defined in the standardized format (AutomationML), and then the corresponding virtual manufacturing resources (DTs) will be integrated into CPPS. Finally, this paper describes a case of information modeling for blisk machining and demonstrates the modeling approach in real-life scenarios for support manufacturing resource sharing via DT. Furthermore, the conclusion and further work is briefly summarized. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081887346

This paper discusses selective technologies that can potentially contribute to developing an intelligent environment and smarter cities. While the connectivity and efficiency of smart cities is important, the analysis of the impact of construction development and large projects in the city is crucial to decision and policy makers, before the project is approved. This raises the question of assessing the impact of a new infrastructure project on the community prior to its commencement-what type of technologies can potentially be used for creating a virtual representation of the city? How can a smart city be improved by utilizing these technologies? There are a wide range of technologies and applications available but understanding their function, interoperability, and compatibility with the community requires more discussion around system designs and architecture. These questions can be the basis of developing an agenda for further investigations. In particular, the need for advanced tools such as mobile scanners, Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Geospatial Augmented Reality apps, Light Detection, and Ranging in smart cities is discussed.

This paper presents the methods of an investigation addressing the extremely complex issues related to the current practices of digital technology adoption in construction. It discusses how construction companies follow a specific logical process linked to need, project objectives, the characteristics of the adopting organization and the characteristics of the new technology to be adopted. The study aims to demonstrate a novel method of data collection and analysis, such as data and methodological triangulation techniques, including the use of NVivo and AHP to explore how companies make the decision to uptake new technology (e.g., advanced crane, tunnel boring machine or drones) by focusing on customer and vendor activities, their interactions, contributing factors and people involved in the process. The major original contribution of this paper is developing an innovative methodological cube for investigating the Construction Technology Adoption Process (CTAP) covering technology adoption, acceptance, diffusion and implementation concepts. CTAP is a framework that delineates the phases of the process that customer organizations use when deciding to adopt a new digital technology and the parallel vendor activities. The significance of these contributions is that they enable vendors to understand how to match their strategies with customer expectations in each phase of CTAP. It also provides a benchmark for new construction companies to use the current best practices of decision making.

One emerging technology that provides immense promise to positively impact safety performance is the unmanned aerial system (UAS). UASs, or drones, can provide several advantages for safety managers: they can move faster than humans, can reach inaccessible areas of job sites, and can be equipped with video cameras, wireless sensors, radar, or communication hardware to transfer real-time data. This study was conducted to identify safety practices that can be improved by using UASs and distinguish user and technical requirements to successfully assist safety managers in conducting their tasks using such aerial systems. These objectives were achieved by distributing an online survey among safety managers in Florida, Georgia, and Nebraska. In total, twenty-two safety mangers responded to the survey and rated as most important three hazardous activities that UASs have great potential to improve: working in proximity of boomed vehicles/cranes, working near an unprotected edge/opening, and working in the blind spot of heavy equipment. In terms of using UASs for safety inspection applications, the top three required technical features rated by safety managers were real-time video communication (video sensor), high-precision outdoor navigation, and sense-and-avoid.

To address these issues, a wide range of automated site data acquisition, including remote sensing (RS) technologies, has been introduced. This review article describes the capabilities and limitations of various scenarios employing RS enabling technologies for localization, with a focus on multi-sensor data fusion models. In particular, we have considered integration of real-time location systems (RTLSs) including GPS and UWB with other sensing technologies such as RFID, WSN, and digital imaging for their use in construction.

This project aims to conduct a systematic critical review including a bibliography analysis on delay literature in construction. The main questions consider what has been learnt from a decade investigating delay causes and effects in the construction literature and what factors have been missed in the literature. This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt. In addition, the paper identifies 30 critical factors with the frequency of occurrences over three times in the DEC dataset and computes their medians of ranking. This paper also discusses digital tools and methods that can be used for delay analysis and preventions, including MS Project, Oracle Primavera P6, and Open Plan by Deltek. The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas. In total, four overlooked factors are identified and suggested, including faulty data analysis, unmatched structure of the research questionnaires with new knowledge and standards [e.g., Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)], overlooked effects of digital technologies [e.g., Digital twin, Navisworks, Building Information Model (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)], and ignored job-site technologies. In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified.

Linking heterogeneous lifecycle data is critical to maintain associativity and traceability in a digital thread. Recently, researchers have successfully leveraged ontology models with knowledge graphs in engineering domains for threading different lifecycle data. One of the most successful of such efforts is OntoSTEP which enables the formal capture of information embedded in the STandard for Exchange of Product model data (STEP) data representation, or ISO 10303. Meanwhile, an emerging inspection standard, called the Quality Information Framework (QIF), has garnered significant attention as it can bring quality information into the digital thread. Implementing more automated methods for product quality assurance is challenging due to the lack of unified information models from design to inspection. To this end, we propose an approach to fuse as-designed data represented in STEP and as-inspected data represented in QIF in a standards-based digital thread based on ontology with knowledge graphs. Specifically, we present an automated pipeline for generating knowledge graphs representing STEP and QIF data, a mapping implementation to integrate STEP and QIF knowledge graphs, and rules and queries to demonstrate the integration's potential for better decision making with respect to product quality assurance. © 2020",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089354473

Exploring building height patterns is required to obtain and visualize essential information about spatio-temporal vertical urban developments due to the trends towards increasing building heights in different urban fabrics. While metrics to characterize horizontal patterns of urban fabric using spectral information exist, theoritical-based metrics identifying the patterns of vertical urban developments using height values are still scarce. In addition, there is a lack of reliable methods to analyze height information for modeling the distribution of building heights and to automatically detect three-dimensional urban patterns. In this paper, we propose to apply the spatial statistics of Local Moran's I (LMI), Gi ∗ and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) on building heights to explore vertical urban patterns through detecting the concentration of relatively higher buildings. The proposed methods were applied on two different airborne lidar point cloud data sets. The results show overall good performance of LMI and Gi* methods compared to KDE. It is also found that there is a higher level of agreement between clusters of relatively higher buildings derived by the autocorrelation statistics of LMI and Gi*, compared with the patterns derived from the Kernel density. For the lower accuracies obtained from the KDE, the authors suggest to use either LMI or Gi* for this kind of study. The spatial closeness of clusters of higher buildings to major roads, defined by the mean distances of the clusters to major roads, were investigated and based on the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's tests, the mean distances were found to be shorter than for all other buildings. Lastly, an analysis of clusters of the relatively higher buildings showed varying land uses for the two case studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078138098

For this, we collected lidar point clouds using two different data collection methods (i.e. mobile and terrestrial lidar systems with a few centimetre level accuracy) and constructed solid 3-dimensional models of a building. The procedures of creating asbuilt models from both data acquisition methods are compared to understand the capability of each for automatic building information modelling.

The predominant data that have been used in the construction industry so far is rather less accurate. Moreover, the conventional methods of data acquisition are based on fieldwork that is time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive. Accuracy of original data and efficiency of data acquisition could be enhanced using new LiDAR technologies. LiDAR is the advanced remote sensing technology that is able to provide 3D data with centimeter to millimeter level accuracy effectively and efficiently. However, the implementation of 3D data for accurate as-built creation is still challenging, especially for openings and fine details of the construction objects in an indoor environment. This paper presents a framework for rapid as-built modeling using 3D point cloud data captured by a handheld LiDAR The procedure involves five key stages from data capturing to create a final model. This paper reports the implementation of the framework using the state-of-the-art mobile LiDAR to analyze fine details of a sample building. LiDAR data of a sample building in an indoor environment is captured using a mobile laser scanner and is analyzed after registration and segmentation processes. The reconstructed model using the as-built data is compared with the existing 2D AutoCAD plans of the sample building and the traditional measurements to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The results of this ongoing study confirm that the proposed model development technique can serve as a reliable tool for accurate development of rapid as-built building models (rABM).

Both BIM and IoT are increasingly being used in the construction industry. However, using BIM in conjunction with IoT for sustainability purposes has not received enough attention in construction. In particular, the capability created from the combination of both technologies has not been exploited. There is a growing consensus that the future of construction operation tends to be smart and intelligent, which would be possible by a combination of both information systems and sensors. This investigation aims to find out the recent efforts of utilizing BIM for lean purposes in the last decade by critically reviewing the published literature and identifying dominant clusters of research topics. More specifically, the investigation is further developed by identifying the gaps in the literature to utilize IoT in conjunction with BIM in construction projects to facilitate applying lean techniques in a more efficient way in construction projects. A systematic review method was designed to identify scholarly papers covering both concepts “lean” and “BIM” in construction and possibilities of using IoT. A total of 48 scholarly articles selected from 26 construction journals were carefully reviewed thorough perusal. The key findings were discussed with industry practitioners. The transcriptions were analyzed employing two coding and cluster analysis techniques. The results of the cluster analysis show two main directions, including the recent practice of lean and BIM interactions and issues of lean and BIM adoption. Findings revealed a large synergy between lean and BIM in control interactions and reduction in variations, and surprisingly there are many uncovered areas in this field. The results also show that the capability of IoT is also largely not considered in recent developments. The number of papers covering both lean and BIM is very limited, and there is a large clear gap in understanding synergetic interactions of lean concepts applying in BIM and IoT in specific fields of construction such as sustainable infrastructure projects. © 2020 by the authors.

The potential advantages for integrating three-dimensional (3D) printing into house construction are significant in Construction Industry 4.0; these include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters for functional and aesthetic purposes, reduction in construction waste from highly precise material placement and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, applying Strand7 Finite Element Analysis software, a numerical model was designed specifically for 3D printing in a cement mix incorporated with recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and found that construction of an arched truss-like roof was structurally feasible without the need for steel reinforcements. Design/methodology/approach: The research method consists of three key steps: design a prototype of possible structural layouts for the 3DSBP, create 24 laboratory samples using a brittle material to identify operation challenges and analyse the correlation between time and scale size and synthesising the numerical analysis and laboratory observations to develop the evaluation criteria for 3DSBP products. The selected house consists of layouts that resemble existing house such as living room, bed rooms and garages. Findings: Some criteria for sustainable construction using 3DP were developed. The Strand7 model results suggested that under the different load combinations as stated in AS1700, the maximum tensile stress experienced is 1.70 MPa and maximum compressive stress experienced is 3.06 MPa. The cement mix of the house is incorporated with rHDPE, which result in a tensile strength of 3 MPa and compressive strength of 26 MPa. That means the house is structurally feasible without the help of any reinforcements. Investigations had also been performed on comparing a flat and arch and found the maximum tensile stress within a flat roof would cause the concrete to fail. Whereas an arch roof had reduced the maximum tensile stress to an acceptable range for concrete to withstand loadings. Currently, there are a few 3D printing techniques that can be adopted for this purpose, and more advanced technology in the future could eliminate the current limitation on 3D printing and bring forth this idea as a common practice in house construction. Originality/value: This study provides some novel criteria for evaluating a 3D printing performance and discusses challenges of 3D utilisation from design and managerial perspectives. The criteria are relied on maximum utility and minimum impact pillars which can be used by scholars and practitioners to measure their performance. The criteria and the results of the computation and experimentation can be considered as critical benchmarks for future practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082429887

This complexity affects the process of job-site technology dissemination and adoption in which construction companies make decisions to purchase and utilise the new technology. The complexity is one of the reasons that many new remote technologies, positioning and locating systems, lasers and drones, 3D printing, and robots are not widely adopted in the short term, despite vendors making determined efforts to overcome this. Three objectives are investigated in this paper: (i) to define criteria for examining patterns of vendors' strategies to support technology adoption; (ii) to present fact-based evidence of different vendors' demonstration methods; and (iii) to present examples of different technology groups based on their required strategies. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal investigation of the construction technology market, including patterns of technology demonstration and a conceptual model of classifying vendors and their technologies in construction market places. The model involves the three most important factors that distinguish technology exhibitors: Physical appearance, Interpersonal relationship and Technology demonstration. Data was collected from technology exhibitions, involving randomly selected vendors. This data was analysed using hierarchical and c-means clustering techniques. The hard-clustering techniques resulted in vendors being placed in five classes based on the elements of the PIT framework. Fuzzy analysis shows how these classes fit into an underlying strategy spectrum. Understanding the strategies used in each class enables new vendors to select their own dissemination strategies based on their own particular circumstances. The practical implication of this study is to present a set of dissemination strategies to new technology stakeholders involved in Industry 4.0. The identified patterns of technology vendor strategies and the novel conceptual model contribute to the body of knowledge in technology diffusion. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069973315

This is in addition to testing your enhancements on a digital copy, making sure that it works and then reflecting the design decisions on your product? The technology that makes this possible is called Digital Twin. Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a product that already exists or that is planned to be produced in its entirety. Although this was first introduced by Grieves in 2002 as a concept within Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), similar approaches have been used since the 1960s [1]. The Digital Twin approach, which was used in projects such as Apollo 13, is now enhanced and strengthened by technologies such as Big Data and artificial intelligence. During the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, oxygen tanks exploded after the launch. It was extremely difficult to solve the technical problems that occurred almost 200,000 miles away. However, NASA had the model (the Twin) of Apollo 13 on the ground, almost like a physical mock-up. The intervention to rescue the crew had been tested first on the physically copied model.

The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action.

In this paper, we propose a novel tolerance modeling framework and methodology based upon parametric space envelope, a purposely built variation tool constructed from base parametric curve. Under proposal, geometric variation (deviation as well as deformation) is modeled and linked to envelope boundary control points’ movement. This indirect tolerance modeling brings various benefits. It is versatile and can handle full set of tolerances specified under GD&T standards including form, profile, and runout tolerance. The proposal can deal with complex manufacturing part and is capable of providing modeling accuracy required by many applications.

Despite this, a trend has been seen recently to hone the IR 4.0 multitudes in the AEC industry. The upsurge has been seen in the usage of Immersive Technologies (ImTs) as one of the disruptive techniques. This paper studies the literature based on ImTs, which are Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) integrating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the AEC sector. A total number of 444 articles were selected from Scopus following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis (PRISMA) protocol of reviewing the literature. Among the selected database, 64 papers are identified as the result of following the protocol, and the articles are divided into eight domains relevant to the AEC indus-try, namely client/stakeholder, design exploration, design analysis, construction planning, construction monitoring, construction health/safety, facility/management, and education/training. This study adopts both a scientometric analysis for bibliometrics visualization and a critical review using Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analysis for finding gaps and state of play. The novelty of this paper lies in the analysis techniques used in the literature to provide an insight into the literature, and it provides directions for the future with an emphasis on developing sustainable development goals (SDGs). In addition, research directions for the future growth on the adoption of ImTs are identified and presented based on categorization in immersive devices, graphical/non-graphical data and, responsive/integrative processes. In addition, five subcategories for each direc-tion are listed, citing the limitations and future/needs. This study presents the roadmap for the suc-cessful adoption of ImTs for industry practitioners and stakeholders in the AEC industry for various domains.

And the digital twin runs on a competent IT infrastructure (say, cloud centers). In essence, a digital twin is typically a software program that takes various real-world data about a ground-level physical system as prospective inputs and produces useful outputs in the form of insights. The outputs generally are the value-adding and decision-enabling predictions or simulations of how that physical system will act on those inputs. These help in quickly and easily realizing highly optimized and organized products with less cost and risk. The manufacturing industry had embraced the digital twin technology long time back to be modern in their operations, outputs, and offerings. The distinct contributions of the digital twin paradigm, since then, have gone up significantly with the seamless synchronization with a number of pioneering technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big and streaming data analytics, data lakes, software-defined cloud environments, blockchain, etc. With the concept of cyber physical systems (CPS) is being adopted and adapted widely and wisely, complicated yet sophisticated electronics devices at the ground level are being blessed with their corresponding digital twins. The digital twins enable data scientists and system designers to optimize a number of things including process excellence, knowledge discovery and dissemination in time, better system design, robust verification and validation, etc. In the recent past, with the flourishing of the blockchain technology, the scope for digital twins has gone up remarkably. This unique combination is bound to produce additional competencies and fresh use cases for enterprises. This chapter is to explain how they integrate and initiate newer opportunities to be grabbed and gained for a better tomorrow. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090745248

Accordingly, modern manufacturing systems must become more agile and responsive to changing global markets and closer to customers. Industry 4.0 technologies have the premises to face these changes in the production paradigm. However, technologies must be supported by methodological approaches focused on the process to be optimized, digitalized, and made more flexible. In this paper, we propose a seamless Human-Computer-Machine Interaction (HCMI) architecture for supporting the supervision activity of the operator in the context of flexible manufacturing systems. The suggested interaction is implemented and validated using a lab case study where we demonstrate how the proposed HCMI architecture, in line with the Industry 4.0 architectural design principles, enables 'close-to-realtime' supervision of the manufacturing system in its self-adaptation to production changes.

This innovation sets up a way to deal with industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name suggests, “Digital Twin” infers that a reproduction of the product is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data, processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the successful working of the products geographically distributed. The impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital twin. The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use. Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the virtual machine without the need of a specific training. With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting, organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud. It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and process it effectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073737509
