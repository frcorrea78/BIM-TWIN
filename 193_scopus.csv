RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing. © 1981, ACM. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019574599

Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043534104

In this work we extend the technique to explicitly incorporate the points as interpolation constraints. The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions. © 2013 ACM.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879498472

This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships.

A typical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial environments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff environments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to their morphology (e.g. the presence of bedforms or by grain size). Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive properties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of multi-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We have thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality around each point. The dimensionality characterizes the local 3D organization of the point cloud within spheres centered on the measured points and varies from being 1D (points set along a line), 2D (points forming a plane) to the full 3D volume. By varying the diameter of the sphere, we can thus monitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the technique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from ground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water surface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other classes achieve accuracy larger than 98%. Comparison with a single scale approach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class separability and spatial resolution of the classification. Scenes between 10 and one hundred million points can be classified on a common laptop in a reasonable time. The technique is robust to missing data, shadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification is fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class morphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic confidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the user to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The process can be both fully automated (minimal user input once, all scenes treated in large computation batches), but also fully customized by the user including a graphical definition of the classifiers if so desired. Working classifiers can be exchanged between users independently of the instrument used to acquire the data avoiding the need to go through full training of the classifier. Although developed for fully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data. © 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

We are developing a face recognition system that utilizes three-dimensional shape information to make the system more robust to arbitrary pose and lighting. For each subject, a 3D face model is constructed by integrating several 2.5D face scans which are captured from different views. 2.5D is a simplified 3D (x, y, z) surface representation that contains at most one depth value (z direction) for every point in the (x, y) plane. Two different modalities provided by the facial scan, namely, shape and texture, are utilized and integrated for face matching. The recognition engine consists of two components, surface matching and appearance-based matching. The surface matching component is based on a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The candidate list from the gallery used for appearance matching is dynamically generated based on the output of the surface matching component, which reduces the complexity of the appearance-based matching stage. Three-dimensional models in the gallery are used to synthesize new appearance samples with pose and illumination variations and the synthesized face images are used in discriminant subspace analysis. The weighted sum rule is applied to combine the scores given by the two matching components. Experimental results are given for matching a database of 200 3D face models with 598 2.5D independent test scans acquired under different pose and some lighting and expression changes.

The HBIM process begins with remote collection of survey data using a terrestrial laser scanner combined with digital photo modelling. The next stage involves the design and construction of a parametric library of objects, which are based on the manuscripts ranging from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books. In building parametric objects, the problem of file format and exchange of data has been overcome within the BIM ArchiCAD software platform by using geometric descriptive language (GDL). The plotting of parametric objects onto the laser scan surveys as building components to create or form the entire building is the final stage in the reverse engineering process. The final HBIM product is the creation of full 3D models including detail behind the object's surface concerning its methods of construction and material make-up.

This paper particularly considers the case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find, recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds automatically. Previous research has also shown that ""Scan-vs-BIM"" systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works, thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking, automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and identification metric. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While recently developed methods in this domain focus on mere local surface reconstructions which enable e.g. efficient visualization, our approach aims for a volumetric, parametric building model that additionally incorporates contextual information such as global wall connectivity. In contrast to pure surface reconstructions, our representation thereby allows more comprehensive use: first, it enables efficient high-level editing operations in terms of e.g. wall removal or room reshaping which always result in a topologically consistent representation. Second, it enables easy taking of measurements like e.g. determining wall thickness or room areas. These properties render our reconstruction method especially beneficial to architects or engineers for planning renovation or retrofitting. Following the idea of previous approaches, the reconstruction task is cast as a labeling problem which is solved by an energy minimization. This global optimization approach allows for the reconstruction of wall elements shared between rooms while simultaneously maintaining plausible connectivity between all wall elements. An automatic prior segmentation of the point clouds into rooms and outside area filters large-scale outliers and yields priors for the definition of labeling costs for the energy minimization. The reconstructed model is further enriched by detected doors and windows.

To facilitate existing-structure data acquisition for the as-built BIM, a terrestrial laser scanner, which is fast, simple to use, and yet highly accurate, is widely employed. However, as-built BIM creation of building interiors using scanned point clouds incurs critical difficulties: the complex design of indoor structures, not to mention obstacles, necessitates time-consuming manual operation and resultantly huge data sizes, which often leads to system slow-down or failure. To manage this problem, most of the recent and current research has looked to full automation; yet facility management personnel still rely on traditional field measurements because their qualitative results can only be obtained under ideal conditions or with some errors. Alternatively, in this paper, a more practical semi-automatic methodology for improved productivity of as-built BIM creation with respect to large and complex indoor environments is proposed. The proposed approach produces three-dimensional (3D) geometric drawings through three steps: segmentation for plane extraction, refinement for removal of noisy points, and boundary tracing for outline extraction.

Based on the automatically produced geometric drawings and the remaining points, manual as-built BIM creation was conducted. Using the extracted lines as guides, each object and its relationship were more easily identified and modeled. At the same time, the great reduction in the point clouds' data sizes enabled the modeler, using the BIM software, to efficiently manipulate the geometric drawing without system slow-down or failure.

BIM is the focus of this paper as not only is there a commercial need, as will be shown by the number of commercial solutions, but also wide research interest due to the aspiration of automated 3D models from both Geomatics and Computer Science communities. The aim is to go beyond the current labour-intensive tracing of the point cloud to an automated process that produces geometry that is both open and more verifiable. This work investigates what can be achieved today with automation through both literature review and by proposing a novel point cloud processing process. We present an automated workflow for the generation of BIM data from 3D point clouds. We also present quality indicators for reconstructed geometry elements and a framework in which to assess the quality of the reconstructed geometry against a reference. © 2015 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942543696

Cultural heritage objects and sites greatly differ from each other and a maximized fidelity of the 3D reconstruction is a core requirement.

The combination of BIM with automation systems improves the quality control during diagnosis, design and work execution, and the labour savings, which is particularly relevant for rapid intervention in case of hazardous conditions. Therefore, the paper is going to address a methodological discussion concerning complete “as-built” parametric models of historical buildings, supporting the design of refurbishment and conservation interventions. Although some reviews of the state of the art exist on the topic of Historic Building Information Modelling, the present research introduces a different perspective on HBIM modelling, with diagnosis and performance assessment as key-aspects, in terms of automating performance assessment. Specifically, from the data collection of contributions regarding HBIM/BIM, diagnostics and monitoring on existing buildings and infrastructures, a critical review by selected criteria is developed. Nevertheless, general methods and tools for information management and exchange tasks in BIM are briefly described as well, since they are considered useful for future developments of HBIM approach. The core of the critical analysis is focused on the scientific and technical relations among HBIM models, diagnosis and performance assessment features. In addition, the review identifies specific activities and relative tools and methods for knowledge acquisition and semantic enrichment. Finally, gaps in knowledge of the current literature are outlined and discussed, with specific focus on performance assessment in HBIM.

The proposed semi-automated method allows the creation of parametric models from photogrammetric and laser scanning point clouds. The method is intended as a multi-step process where NURBS curves and surfaces are used to reconstruct complex and irregular objects, without excessive simplification of the information encapsulated into huge point clouds to avoid heavy models useless for practical purposes and productive work.

However, whereas fast and accurate reconstruction of building interiors is essential to any collaborative construction management process, manual creation and utilization of a 3D as-built model typically results in low productivity and erroneous modeling results. This paper proposes a semi-automated method that accounts for and resolves the major problems in the streamlined manual process of 3D as-built model creation in BIM. The method generates a 3D wireframe model combined with clutter data, which is then imported into a BIM tool for as-built modeling. The present study evaluates the proposed method by applying it to two typical rooms in a test building. The 3D as-built model was then subjected to an accuracy assessment using reference points acquired by a total station. The contributions of the proposed method, as compared with fully manual operation, are: (1) reduction of the huge data size of the original point clouds; (2) improvement of the productivity of as-built BIM creation with the aid of 3D wireframes; and (3) accuracy enhancement through a refinement process that entails segmentation and regularization. However, the proposed method is limited to building interiors consisting of planar structures; the modeling of detailed objects, such as windows and doors, unfortunately, still requires manual operation. Thus, further research on detail modeling and refinement is necessary in order to increase the method's automation and enhancement of its overall suitability for mapping complex indoor environments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959851942

Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings.

This is currently undertaken through laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation of tree-level point clouds from larger-area point clouds, an effort that is impracticable across thousands of stems. Here, we present treeseg, an open-source software to automate this task. This method utilises generic point cloud processing techniques including Euclidean clustering, principal component analysis, region-based segmentation, shape fitting and connectivity testing. This data-driven approach uses few a priori assumptions of tree architecture, and transferability across lidar instruments is constrained only by data quality requirements. We demonstrate the treeseg algorithm here on data acquired from both a structurally simple open forest and a complex tropical forest. Across these data, we successfully automatically extract 96% and 70% of trees, respectively, with the remainder requiring some straightforward manual segmentation. treeseg allows ready and quick access to tree-scale information contained in lidar point clouds. treeseg should help contribute to more wide-scale uptake of lidar-derived methods to applications ranging from the estimation of carbon stocks through to descriptions of plant form and function. © 2018 The Authors.

Two new developments for as-built BIM modelling are presented in this article. The first is a new library of reusable parametric objects designed for modelling classical architectural elements from survey data. These library objects are dynamic and have parameters that can instantly alter the shape, size and other properties of objects. The parametric architectural objects have been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded programming language within the ArchiCAD BIM software called Geometric Description Language (GDL). The second development which is described in more detail in this article is a complete parametric building façade. This parametric building facade can be used as a template for fast and efficient generation of BIM facade geometry. The design of this parametric façade incorporates concepts from procedural modelling which is an automated approach to generating 3D geometries based on rules and algorithms. Parametric architectural objects are automatically combined with rules to generate many different façade arrangements which are controlled by user parameters. When automatically generating a façade, the initial position and size of elements are estimated using classical architectural proportions. Object can then be graphically edited individually or in groups to match the computer generated geometry to survey data. The parametric façade template has also been implemented with the Geometric Description Language for ArchiCAD BIM software. This enables the tools developed to utilise the full benefits of BIM software which includes automated construction or conservation documents, semantic object oriented objects based on IFC semantic classes, automatic lists of objects and material and the ability to add and link additional information to the model. Initial user tests have indicated that the parametric façade is more efficient than previous methods for creating accurate façade models from survey data. The façade template also provides an easier solution for generating façade models when compared to existing methods. Non-specialist users with little experience in 3D modelling can easily generate and modify the façade template by altering parameters graphically or from a dialogue box. © 2014 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894458566

The classifier was trained on two manually labeled scans from summer and winter, then tested on three other unseen times. We find that F Score generally remains above 0.9 for talus and vegetation, and above 0.95 for bedrock and snow, indicating very high accuracy and an ability to adapt to changing seasonal conditions. In comparing this approach to CANUPO, an existing classification tool, we find our approach to be generally more accurate and flexible, at the expense of increased complexity and computation time. Comparisons with manual masking and a hybrid approach indicate that a machine learning solution is useful primarily in cases of rapidly changing rock slopes or in climates with significant seasonal variability and snow. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074562976

The current challenge still involves the extraction of geometric primitives and the establishment of their connection to heterogeneous knowledge. As a recently developed 3D information modeling environment, building information modeling (BIM) entails both graphical and non-graphical aspects of the entire building, which has been increasingly applied to heritage documentation and generates a new issue of heritage/historic BIM (HBIM). However, HBIM needs to additionally deal with the heterogeneity of geometric shape and semantic knowledge of the heritage object. This paper developed a new mesh-to-HBIM modeling workflow and an integrated BIM management system to connect HBIM elements and historical knowledge. Using the St-Pierre-le-Jeune Church, Strasbourg, France as a case study, this project employs Autodesk Revit as a BIM environment and Dynamo, a built-in visual programming tool of Revit, to extend the new HBIM functions. The mesh-to-HBIM process segments the surface mesh, thickens the triangle mesh to 3D volume, and transfers the primitives to BIM elements. The obtained HBIM is then converted to the ontology model to enrich the heterogeneous knowledge. Finally, HBIM geometric elements and ontology semantic knowledge is joined in a unified BIM environment. By extending the capability of the BIM platform, the HBIM modeling process can be conducted in a time-saving way, and the obtained HBIM is a semantic model with object-oriented knowledge. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069581674

While airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides uniform data and a consistent nadir perspective necessary for crown segmentation, the data characteristics of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) make such crown segmentation efforts much more challenging. We present a data fusion approach to extract crown structure from TLS, by exploiting the complementary perspective of ALS. Multiple TLS point clouds are automatically registered to a single ALS point cloud by maximizing the normalized cross correlation between the global ALS canopy height model (CHM) and each of the local TLS CHMs through parameter optimization of a planar Euclidean transform. Per-tree canopy segmentation boundaries, which are reliably obtained from ALS, can then be adapted onto the more irregular TLS data. This is repeated for each TLS scan; the combined segmentation results from each registered TLS scan and the ALS data are fused into a single per-tree point cloud, from which canopy-level structural parameters readily can be extracted. © 2016 -2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018630064

This context encoding module greatly improves the segmentation performance, especially for inconspicuous objects. Furthermore, we propose a scale-selection scheme to selectively fuse the segmentation results from different-scales of features at every spatial position.

It is also challenging because of the complexity and great variety of the available 3D building facade layouts as well as the noise and data missing of the input TLS point clouds. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for the accurate and computationally efficient parsing of urban building facades from TLS point clouds. The main novelty of the proposed methodology is that it is a systematic and hierarchical approach that considers, in an adaptive way, the semantic and underlying structures of the urban facades for segmentation and subsequent accurate modeling. Firstly, the available input point cloud is decomposed into depth planes based on a data-driven method; such layer decomposition enables similarity detection in each depth plane layer. Secondly, the labeling of the facade elements is performed using the SVM classifier in combination with our proposed BieS-ScSPM algorithm. The labeling outcome is then augmented with weak architectural knowledge. Thirdly, least-squares fitted normalized gray accumulative curves are applied to detect regular structures, and a binarization dilation extraction algorithm is used to partition facade elements. A dynamic line-by-line division is further applied to extract the boundaries of the elements. The 3D geometrical façade models are then reconstructed by optimizing facade elements across depth plane layers. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed method using several TLS facade datasets. Qualitative and quantitative performance comparisons with several other state-of-the-art methods dealing with the same facade parsing problem have demonstrated its superiority in performance and its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy. © 2016",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000819173

Much of the assessment is carried out through visual inspection. Thus, this process will be automated by applying image processing on digital images of the elements under inspection.

This scope is strongly related to heritage buildings. Protection plans encompassing phases of heritage conservation, interpretation, intervention and dissemination could lead to a sustainable model through a TeamWork-HBIM project. This work develops a step by step semantically enriched 3D model, from accurate data acquisition to the creation of a container of artistic assets. TeamWork-HBIM acts as a database for movable assets, i.e., parametric objects (GDL) with graphical and semantic information, which are valid for recording, inventory and cataloguing processes. Thus, heritage properties were created and used to create recording and inventory sheets related to movable assets. Consequently, a parametric object was edited in the HBIM project, so a new category called “Heritage Furniture” was available. Data from the monitoring of the artistic asset were included in that category. In addition, the specialist technicians from the TeamWork-HBIM team catalogued a dataset related to artistic, historical and conservation properties. Another advantage of the system was the reliability of the structure of the HBIM project, which was based on the actual geometry of the building provided by the point clouds. The information was valid for both modelling works and specialists in virtual monitoring. Moreover, the reliability of metadata was collected in a common data environment (CDE), which was available for everyone. As a result, the TeamworkHBIM-CDE project meets the needs of private institutions, such as the Foundation of the Church of the Company of Jesus in Quito, related to the sustainability of the historic site. This sustainability is shown by the implementation of a methodology that strengthens the interdisciplinary information flow by including all disciplines of historical heritage. © 2021 by the authors.

The achievement of 3D models requires the implementation of several tasks such as segmentation. Segmentation is the key step during the point cloud processing where all homogeneous areas are identified, which describe a building facade. Usually, a large part of the segmentation approach focuses on the geometric information contained in the point cloud data by exploiting mathematical representation of a parametric surface. However, due to the complexity of the architecture, such segmentation does not suffice. Henceforth, other approaches turn to the use of color and laser intensity components. Although a variety of algorithms have been developed in this sense, problems of over-segmentation or under-segmentation are observed. In this context, we propose a new approach for point cloud segmentation aiming at a more accurate result. This approach relies on all the components of a colored point &ndash; both geometric and radiometric &ndash; combining the RGB values, laser intensity and geometric data. Our process begins with the extraction of homogeneous planar segments using the RANSAC algorithm. Next, the result is subjected to a radiometric-based segmentation, first through color similarity as one of the homogeneity criteria of a region growing algorithm, then through the use of intensity similarity for segment fusion. Experiments are performed on a facade presenting an example of Moroccan classical architecture located in Casablanca's Medina. Results show the importance of integrating all point cloud components, both geometric and radiometric. © 2013 Copernicus. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045030797

Accordingly, research has identified the best methods to survey historic buildings, but the suitability of Structure-from-Motion/Multi-view-Stereo (SfM/MVS) for interior square symmetrical architectural spaces is unexplored. In contrast to the traditional SfM surveying for which the camera surrounds the object, the photograph collection approach is divergent in courtyards. This paper evaluates the accuracy of SfM point clouds against Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) for these large architectural spaces with a symmetrical configuration, with the main courtyard of Casa de Pilatos in Seville, Spain, as a case study. Two different SfM surveys were conducted: (1) Without control points, and (2) referenced using a total station. The first survey yielded unacceptable results: A standard deviation of 0.0576 m was achieved in the northwest sector of the case study, mainly because of the difficulty of aligning the SfM and TLS data due to the way they are produced. This value could be admissible depending on the purpose of the photogrammetric model. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097290651

The point cloud obtained by TLS measurement was processed to derive the longitudinal axis of the RK. Subsequently, the carrier tires’ geometric parameters and shell of the RK during the shutdown were derived. Manual point cloud selection (segmentation) is the base method for removing unnecessary points. This method is slow but precise and controllable. The proposed analytical solution is based on calculating the distance from each point to the RK’s nominal axis (local radius). Iteration using a histogram function was repeatedly applied to detect points with the same or similar radiuses. The most numerous intervals of points were selected and stored in separate files. In the comparison, we present the conformity of analytically and manually obtained files and derived geometric values of the RK-radiuses’ spatial parameters and coordinates of the carrier tires’ centers. The horizontal (X and Y directions) and vertical (Z-direction) of root–mean– square deviation (RMSD) values are up to 2 mm. RMSD of the fitting of cylinders is also up to 2 mm. The center of the carrier tires defines the longitudinal axis of the RK. Analytical segmentation of the points was repeated on the remaining point cloud for the selection of the points on the outer shell of the RK. Deformation analysis of the shell of the RK was performed using a cylinder with a nominal radius. Manually and analytically processed point clouds were investigated and mutually compared. The calculated RMSD value is up to 2 mm. Parallel cuts situated perpendicularly to the axis of the RK were created. Analysis of ovality (flattening) of the shell was performed. Additionally, we also present the effect of gradually decreasing density (number) of points on the carrier tires for their center derivation. © 2020 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to understand and describe the tourist segments with similar levels of perceived destination sustainability and trustworthiness. Perceived sustainability and perceived trustworthiness are based on tourists’ perceptions of the impacts of tourism development and policies of destinations and are measured as multidimensional constructs. Based on a sample of 438 tourists from Chile and Ecuador aged over 17 years, a metaheuristic (genetic algorithm) is employed to select the most useful variables for segmentation using a machine learning process. The results reveal three tourist segments: Extremely optimistic (Segment 3), Optimistic (Segment 2) and Moderately optimistic (Segment 1). These segments differ considerably in terms of the impacts of the dimensions of destination sustainability (environmental, sociocultural, and economic) and trustworthiness (ability, benevolence, and integrity). However, they do not differ in terms of most sociodemographic characteristics. As segmentation criteria, perceived sustainability and trustworthiness can help when analyzing the effectiveness of sustainability strategies and actions by the public and private institutions at tourist destinations. © 2020",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097410976

For this aim, it is essential to control all the workflow covering data acquisition by topographic techniques, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) or photogrammetry and the so-called Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM). For this purpose, the parametric modelling by BIM requires the improvement of the mesh integration of sculptural elements previously generated from point clouds by TLS. Thus, the success of the final outcome will depend in large measure on the work‐flow generated with different software used for the mesh modelling and refining and its integration in the BIM model. Once sculptural elements have been integrated in the BIM model, their information implementation and the introduction of behavior and features associated become critical for the correct interpretation.
