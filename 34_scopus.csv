Despite its potential benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive systematic literature review and case study research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model.

In practice, tower cranes are managed based on demand, urgency, and prioritized work tasks that must be performed within a set period of time in the field. As a computer tool, simulation has proved to be effective in modeling complex construction operations and can be a substantial help in aiding practitioners in construction planning. However, the use of simulation has fallen far below its maximum potential due to a lack of appropriate support tools which would allow construction managers to use simulation tools for themselves. Special purpose simulation (SPS) and 3D visualization of simulated operations are two potential means that enable domain experts, who are knowledgeable in give domains, but not familiar with simulation, to easily model an operation within their domain and analyze the simulation results. This paper presents a practical methodology for integrating 3D visualization with SPS for tower crane operation. An integrated system was built in a 3D Studio MAX environment and tested in the construction of the new civil and environmental engineering building at the University of Alberta. This paper demonstrates that 3D visualization is helpful in the verification and validation of simulation results, and can effectively communicate the essence of a simulated operation, thus improving the accessibility of simulation as a decision making aid. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We conceptualize customization relevant to the two constituent sub-processes in the online purchase process: (i) decision customization - the customization of the information content delivered to customers to help them in the decision-making sub-process; and (ii) transaction customization - the customization of the purchase transaction sub-process for each customer. We draw on and synthesize the theoretical perspectives of Website Usability, Technology Acceptance Model, and Transaction Costs, to triangulate and deduce hypotheses linking customization of the online purchase process in electronic retailing and customer satisfaction. The hypotheses are tested by analyzing: (i) primary data on customization of the online purchase process collected from an online field study involving a direct observation and content analysis of the websites of 422 retailers; and (ii) secondary data on customer satisfaction with the online purchase process for the same set of 422 electronic retailers collected from a publicly available data source. The research method used for the empirical analysis is Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). The results indicate that decision customization that provides choice assistance by way of personalized product recommendations is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the decision-making sub-process; and transaction customization, oriented towards making the transaction sub-process personal, convenient, and interactive is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the purchase transaction sub-process. Additionally, the results indicate that both decision customization and transaction customization are associated with overall customer satisfaction with the online purchase process of electronic retailers.

Although industrialized building systems can potentially simplify the production process, there is usually a high level of complexity in ETO production systems, such as uncertainty in client demands, short lead-time, overlapping between project stages, and resources that are shared among different projects. In this context, logistics management plays a key role in terms of achieving project goals related to cost, time and safety. This research work proposes the combined use of principles from the Lean Production Philosophy and Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a mechanism to cope with the complexity involved in those types of projects. Although these can be regarded as two separate approaches for improving the performance of production systems in the construction industry, there are evidences that there is much synergy between them. This paper reports the development of a logistics planning and control model for site assembly of ETO prefabricated building systems using BIM 4D modeling. The main theoretical contribution of this research work is the understanding of the synergies between Lean principles and BIM functionalities that are applicable to site logistics management, providing an example of how this body of knowledge can be expanded. This investigation also provides some practical contributions on how to carry out logistics planning and control at different hierarchical levels, with the support of BIM 4D modeling, aligning this process with the Last Planner System of production control.

This paper presents model-based rule checking for the planning of construction site layouts. We demonstrate that existing Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS), such as the open-source rule engine Drools, can be used. We combine Drools with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to retrieve data from a building information model and use the information within the rule engine. We define general model requirements and implement a sample set of prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset geometry for rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between temporary construction site elements.

This work presents a prototype system to which crane-specific rules are applied in a rule-checking platform that uses a 4D model as input. In the validation tests, the system's effectiveness is demonstrated by its high recall rates. Efficiency is achieved through diminishing manual interventions.

Thus, selecting not only the best crane type and model, but also the most efficient crane operation among alternatives, can result in productivity and safety improvements. In this respect, this paper proposes an integrated decision support model which designs, simulates, and evaluates potential crane operations in accordance with feasible crane types and models based on equipment, cost, site, and environmental aspects of the project.

Proper utilization of temporary structures can have a significant influence on critical aspects of the project such as cost, productivity, and safety. However, a process of planning temporary structures still relies on labor-intensive and error-prone efforts based on implicit knowledge of workers. Moreover, temporary structures are planned without detailed spatiotemporal analysis of their implications and systemized approach to safety. This tendency may yield the inefficient employment of temporary structures and unsafe job sites. Lack of systemized approach for identifying hazards related to the temporary structure would result in not only an economic loss but also fatalities and injuries. This paper introduces a building information model- (BIM-) based decision support system that provides safety plans for temporary structures considering their costs and durations. Focusing on scaffolding, the system automatically generates multiple scaffolding plans and quantitatively evaluates them regarding safety, cost, and duration. By analyzing project-specific spatiotemporal information to identify relevant hazards and variations of cost and duration, a specific plan for utilizing scaffolds, which is the most appropriate regarding safety, cost, and duration, is selected among the generated plans. The developed system was implemented using a BIM software tool and validated with an in-depth case study on a real-world construction project.

Within the module 'Planning', tasks are assigned following budget specifications. By the module 'Actualization' the deviation from budget is measured.

More specifically, we provide an online service for viewing, storing and analysing BIM. Cloud technologies were used to develop a web interface as a BIM data centre, which can handle large BIM data using a server. The server can be accessed by many users through various electronic devices anytime and anywhere so they can view online 3D models using browsers. Nowadays, the Cloud computing is engaged progressively in facilitating BIM-based collaboration between the multiple stakeholders and disciplinary groups for complicated Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects. Besides, the development of Open Source Software (OSS) has been rapidly growing and their use tends to be united. Although BIM and Cloud technologies are extensively known and used, there is a lack of integrated open source Cloud-based platforms able to support all stages of BIM processes. The present research aims to create an open source Cloud-based BIM system that is able to handle geospatial data. In this effort, only open source tools will be used; from the starting point of creating the 3D model with FreeCAD to its online presentation through BIMserver. Python plug-ins will be developed to link the two software which will be distributed and freely available to a large community of professional for their use. The research work will be completed by benchmarking four Cloud-based BIM systems: Autodesk BIM 360, BIMserver, Graphisoft BIMcloud and Onuma System, which present remarkable results. © Authors 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048360116

Currently, there is a lack of appropriate assessment approaches to capture the differences between modular and conventional construction. This paper proposes a framework to aid decision makers in choosing between the latter construction methods through the integration of building information models with material libraries, project schedules and machinery inventory. A fixed set of performance parameters, whose attributes are shared among both construction methods, are defined to allow for a reasonable comparison across multiple criteria, including embodied carbon, productivity and total construction costs expended. The dynamics of the project are incorporated by modelling the various stages of the project within a building information model. The proposed framework is tested on a realistic case example, highlighting its applicability as a decision support tool for construction method selection.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032385451

This, especially in a process that concerns the management and maintenance of a large building stocks, involves the processing of uncertain information in BIM, particularly when dealing with existing buildings, due to the lack of and/or incomplete documentation, entailing a significant investment in terms of time and additional costs. Therefore, to represent the reliability of existing building data, we suggest introducing a tool based on Bayesian Network that offers a valid decision support under conditions of uncertainty and is used to evaluate the compliance with the latest standard.

Experimental parameters were optimized by fractional factorial design and response surface methodology. Fractional factorial design was employed in screening experiments to evaluate the influence of the oxygen pressure, catalyst, absorption solution, reduction reagent, bomb cooling time, and a combustion aid on the combustion of coal in an oxygen bomb. Response surface methodology was conducted to further refine the results obtained by fractional factorial design and to define parameters for the procedure. The accuracy and precision of combustion with ion chromatography were evaluated by the use of two certified reference materials and by fortified in-house coal standards. The limits of detection and quantification for total halogens were 0.84 and 2.80 milligrams per kilogram, respectively, for 500 milligram samples. Ion chromatography provided relative standard deviations less than 4 percent, recoveries exceeding 95 percent, and was convenient.

Current approaches and tools being used by industry to facilitate tower crane planning can be time-consuming, difficult to disclose all constraints, and challenging in visualizing and comprehending alternatives. Hence, tower crane planning experiential knowledge needs to be formalized to develop an efficient approach and effective tools to support tower crane planning. This research aims at formalizing criteria for tower crane planning by examining standards published by regulatory institutes and synthesizing knowledge of professional experts. Learning from the criteria and the knowledge inherent in current procedures, we devised an enhanced planning approach leveraging building information modeling (BIM) and optimization models. Finally, this paper demonstrates the utility of the formalized criteria and the proposed approach by applying them to a case study on a building construction project. Using a combination of parametric modelling, BIM, and optimization techniques, tower crane planning can be less time consuming and more accurate. Visualization capabilities and improved information quality in the planning process are also beneficial. For future work, the proposed approach for tower crane planning can be further analyzed to develop benchmarking metrics that can be applied, in general, to any building project, despite project unique characteristics. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021736056

To reduce cost and improve overall efficiency, the tower crane should be well located to move heavy materials. This paper proposes an optimization algorithm to identify the optimal type and location of attached tower crane with proper location of material supply point. The algorithm concerns four main models:1) tower crane location generation model to define alternative type and area for allocating crane.2) supply point location model for selecting all potential area to establish supply point.3) tower crane optimization model to get the ideal location of tower crane and supply point. 4) 4D simulation model to evaluate and visualize the optimal layout scheme through BIM. Then, a practical case, in China, is described in order to demonstrate the outputs obtained by the optimization algorithm. Later, three typical situations of construction site are discussed based on the case. The results reveal the rule that the trolley sliding movement is weightier than the jib rotation movement when considering the optimal layout scheme. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

It is essential that the right mobile crane be chosen for the job. An inappropriate choice of crane can easily become the source of a serious accident. The current practice of crane choice for a particular lifting job relies on an engineer’s experience in the planning of the crane’s lifting operation. The work-cum-calculations involved tend to be a tedious manual and potentially error-prone process. This paper utilizes recent developments in Building Information Modelling (BIM) to address this problem. The paper presents a comprehensive framework to model a mobile crane’s safe lifting requirements using a 3D BIM model. Given the crane’s lifting requirements, this paper proposes a decision support system for the safe planning of the mobile crane’s operations.

Without properly assembling scaffoldings, the construction process could be delayed, and workers could be exposed to danger. However, construction workers usually rely on their past experiences to assemble scaffoldings without detailed planning. Consequently, lack of necessary components delivered to the site, assembling does not match with the construction process, or staggered with the floor of the building, could occur and jeopardize the construction project. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the emerging technology that can help construction engineers obtain information for detailed planning. However, the scaffolding system is not usually developed in the BIM model. Although several researchers have developed programs that can automate assembling scaffoldings in the BIM model, the results could not provide construction managers with sufficient information to make decisions in terms of various environmental scenarios. This research establishes a mechanism to automate information generation for assembling scaffolding from the perspective of material management. First, a thorough interview with stakeholders related to the scaffolding system is conducted to identify the uses and information requirements. Then, an ontology model is employed to determine the specification to develop the scaffolding system within the BIM model. Afterward, a series of Dynamo modules are developed to automate assembling scaffolding in the BIM model. Finally, the result shows that with the implementation of Dynamo modules, the detailed information of assembling scaffolding can be effectively and efficiently obtained.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032386432
