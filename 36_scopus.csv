There is a growing recognition of the value of synthesising qualitative research in the evidence base in order to facilitate effective and appropriate health care. In response to this, methods for undertaking these syntheses are currently being developed. Thematic analysis is a method that is often used to analyse data in primary qualitative research. This paper reports on the use of this type of analysis in systematic reviews to bring together and integrate the findings of multiple qualitative studies. Methods. We describe thematic synthesis, outline several steps for its conduct and illustrate the process and outcome of this approach using a completed review of health promotion research. Thematic synthesis has three stages: the coding of text 'line-by-line'; the development of 'descriptive themes'; and the generation of 'analytical themes'. While the development of descriptive themes remains 'close' to the primary studies, the analytical themes represent a stage of interpretation whereby the reviewers 'go beyond' the primary studies and generate new interpretive constructs, explanations or hypotheses. The use of computer software can facilitate this method of synthesis; detailed guidance is given on how this can be achieved. Results. We used thematic synthesis to combine the studies of children's views and identified key themes to explore in the intervention studies. Most interventions were based in school and often combined learning about health benefits with 'hands-on' experience. The studies of children's views suggested that fruit and vegetables should be treated in different ways, and that messages should not focus on health warnings. Interventions that were in line with these suggestions tended to be more effective. Thematic synthesis enabled us to stay 'close' to the results of the primary studies, synthesising them in a transparent way, and facilitating the explicit production of new concepts and hypotheses. Conclusion. We compare thematic synthesis to other methods for the synthesis of qualitative research, discussing issues of context and rigour. Thematic synthesis is presented as a tried and tested method that preserves an explicit and transparent link between conclusions and the text of primary studies; as such it preserves principles that have traditionally been important to systematic reviewing. © 2008 Thomas and Harden; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749126232

A rigorous analysis of the myriad specific interactions between them indicates that a synergy exists which, if properly understood in theoretical terms, can be exploited to improve construction processes beyond the degree to which it might be improved by application of either of these paradigms independently. Using a matrix that juxtaposes BIM functionalities with prescriptive lean construction principles, 56 interactions have been identified, all but four of which represent constructive interaction. Although evidence for the majority of these has been found, the matrix is not considered complete but rather a framework for research to explore the degree of validity of the interactions. Construction executives, managers, designers, and developers of information technology systems for construction can also benefit from the framework as an aid to recognizing the potential synergies when planning their lean and BIM adoption strategies. © 2010 ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955883757

Important issues for future research are then suggested in the form of research questions. The paper's aim is to also contribute by stimulating scholars to further study this area in depth, which will lead to a better understanding of the compatibility and impact on organisational performance of lean and green initiatives.

Purpose: This paper aims to explain a comprehensive and systemic evaluation and assessment of the relevant BIM technologies as part of the BIM adoption and implementation to demonstrate how efficiency gains have been achieved towards a lean architectural practice. Design/methodology/approach The research is undertaken through a KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) project between the University of Salford and the John McCall Architects based in Liverpool, which is an SME (Small Medium Enterprise). The overall aim of KTP is to develop a lean design practice through the BIM adoption and implementation. The overall BIM implementation approach uses a socio-technical view in which it does not only consider the implementation of technology but also considers the socio-cultural environment that provides the context for its implementation. The technology adoption methodology within the BIM implementation approach is the action research oriented qualitative and quantitative research for discovery, comparison, and experimentation as the KTP project with JMA provides an environment for ""learning by doing"". Findings: Research has proved that BIM technology adoption should be undertaken with a bottom-up approach rather than top-down approach for successful change management and dealing with the resistance to change. As a result of the BIM technology adoption, efficiency gains are achieved through the piloting projects and the design process is improved through the elimination of wastes and value generation. Originality/value: Successful BIM adoption needs an implementation strategy. However, at operational level, it is imperative that professional guidelines are required as part of the implementation strategy. This paper introduces a systematic approach for BIM technology adoption based on a case study implementation and it demonstrates a guideline at the operational level for other architectural companies of architectural practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551686205

One approach for improving the situation is using lean construction. Lean construction results from the application of a new form of production management to construction. Essential features of lean construction include a clear set of objectives for the delivery process, aimed at maximizing performance for the customer at the project level, concurrent design, construction, and the application of project control throughout the life cycle of the project from design to delivery. An increasing number of construction academics and professionals have been storming the ramparts of conventional construction management in an effort to deliver better value to owners while making real profits. As a result, lean-based tools have emerged and have been successfully applied to simple and complex construction projects. In general, lean construction projects are easier to manage, safer, completed sooner, and cost less and are of better quality. Significant research remains to complete the translation to construction of lean thinking in Egypt. This research will discuss principles, methods, and implementation phases of lean construction showing the waste in construction and how it could be minimized. The Last Planner System technique, which is an important application of the lean construction concepts and methodologies and is more prevalent, proved that it could enhance the construction management practices in various aspects. Also, it is intended to develop methodology for process evaluation and define areas for improvement based on lean approach principles. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889644192

However, there has been very little research done so far on the effect that BIM has on sustainable construction practices. Hence, the goal of this research is to investigate the perceptions of the use of BIM for sustainable design and construction among designers and constructors. A survey was developed and administered through the Internet to determine the existing trends of BIM application in general as well as its use as a tool in sustainable design and construction. The survey results indicated that although the majority of the respondents believed that sustainable design and construction practices were of importance within their company, most still believed that sustainability was not a primary application of BIM and that project coordination and visualization were instead more important. Although BIM is perceived as a multidisciplinary tool, problems with interoperability continue to persist among the various BIM applications in the industry. In terms of project delivery methods, the majority of the survey respondents believed that design/build and integrated project delivery (IPD) are the optimal project delivery methods to integrate BIM as a sustainability tool.

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long ""lookahead"" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers.

To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement.

An evolutionary view is overlooked because extant literature describes technology in a particular epoch. An ecosystem perspective needs to influence IT strategy as an emerging “digital layer” transcends a smart city and continues to function long after a traditional construction project completes. We describe innovation as a succession of transformational waves in an evolutionary process that is currently manifesting as “Industry 4.0” and changing expectations for the construction industry.

The 22 factors identified from the qualitative data analyses were then developed into a questionnaire survey. The exploratory factor analysis of the responses reveals five major groups of BIM expectations for CDW management, which are: (i) BIM-based collaboration for waste management, (ii) waste-driven design process and solutions, (iii) waste analysis throughout building lifecycle, (iv) innovative technologies for waste intelligence and analytics, and (v) improved documentation for waste management. Considering these groups of factors is key to meeting the needs of the stakeholders regarding the use of BIM for CDW management.

To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868 MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40 kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5 μA at 3 V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2 days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments. © 2017",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040001669

The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043597534

Evaluating the effect of using the new tool is described in terms of two measurements: Percent Expected Time-overrun (PET) and Percent Plan Completed (PPC). The most important risk factors are identified and assessed, while PET is quantified at the project start and during the project execution using a model for time-overrun quantification. The results showed that total project time is reduced by 15.57% due to decreasing PET values, while PPC values improved.

However, it is complex to apply in the design phase. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can help to perform LCA during the design process. Current BIM-LCA approaches follow two trends. Either they use complex models in detailed design phases, when it is late for major changes, or they are based on simplified approaches only applicable in early design stages. This paper proposes a novel method for applying LCA continuously over the entire building design process to assess the embodied environmental impacts by using the data provided by BIM with as much accuracy as possible in each stage. The method uses different LCA databases with different levels of detail for the specific level of development (LOD) of the BIM. Since different building elements are not modelled with identical LODs in each design phase, the assessment of embodied environmental impacts is conducted by consistently mixing the LCA databases, which is possible as long as the databases use identical background data. The method is applied to five design stages of a building case study. The results show that it is now possible to calculate the embodied impacts in all design stages while being consistent with the results from the completed project. The environmental impact in a certain design phase is always within the range of variability of the previous phase. Therefore, the method allows to estimate the final embodied environmental impact with increasing accuracy and by that provide information for decision-making throughout the whole design process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059301627

Building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a digital platform through which project teams can share information better and improve project performance. However, many barriers to BIM adoption exist. The successful alignment of BIM technology with work processes as well as willingness to coordinate among project participants are considered most critical for successful BIM adoption. Lean construction practices address the issue of improving coordination within a project team and provide some recipes for how enhanced coordination can be brought about. While the use of BIM as a mediating intervention to enable effective lean practice implementation as an outcome has been documented, the use of lean practices as mediators for achieving enhanced levels of BIM use has not been adequately studied. This paper attempts to address this gap and understand if and how lean practices can be used to enable BIM adoption. Using an ethnographic action research methodology, two metro rail station projects are studied in India, a country where cost and time overruns in many sectors are much higher than the global average. On one project, building information models were built and an attempt was made to use these models for enhanced decision making. On the second project, the last planner system was implemented for 6 months, after which BIM was introduced on the project. The extent to which BIM was used for effective decision making leading to accurate planning and timely completion of activities was measured. On the first project, BIM was hardly used for decision making. On the second project, lean practices created a culture of coordination that incentivized the planning team to specify the kinds of building information models that were to be built, which would align with challenges faced on site. These models were subsequently debated upon collectively and were used for decision making with regards to planning and sequencing, suggesting enhanced BIM adoption. It is argued that lean practices can enable BIM adoption and the two reinforce each other. This paper contributes to knowledge on BIM adoption by showing how lean practices reduce coordination-related issues within the project organization, paving the way for BIM adoption. Building information modeling in conjunction with lean practices can therefore be used on construction projects to improve project performance. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931042668

The study also aims to formulate a conceptual framework of the different stages in the adoption process identify gaps in the existing literature and to provide a holistic picture of contemporary research in technology adoption in construction research literature. Design/methodology/approach - A generic framework is initially proposed containing the fundamental concepts of ""pre-adoption"", ""adoption"" and ""post-adoption"". The review separates the literature according to three key perspectives: ""socio-economic""; ""managerial""; and ""psychological"". The applicability of the existing approaches to the construction context is discussed, and then a new conceptual framework for construction is developed. Findings - Significant gaps in the understanding of construction technology adoption are identified that provide an interesting agenda for future research. A Construction Technology Adoption Framework is presented, which draws together all of sub-processes involved in technology adoption. This framework covers key activities of both the vendor and the customer. Research limitations/implications - The study has been restricted to information technologies and construction equipment technology. Other construction technologies, such as formwork systems, have not been examined. Practical implications - The new framework provides a direction for research into the technology adoption process including key sub-processes and potential research areas. The framework also assists vendors to influence customers' decision-making processes, and guides new customers in setting up their own decision procedures. Originality/value - This paper departs from earlier research by focusing on information and equipment technology adoption rather than innovation adoption in general. In addition, this paper considers both sides of the adoption equation (vendor and customer), which is in contrast to previous binary studies which considered one side or the other. It delineates the boundaries of different concepts such as diffusion, adoption, acceptance and implementation, which have been interchangeably used in previous studies.

To develop this framework, we examined critical factors affecting productivity at the operational level, and then forecast the productivity dynamics. The resulting plan includes specific commands for retrieving the required information from BIM and executing operation simulations. It consists of the following steps: (1) preparing a BIM model to produce input data; (2) composing a construction simulation at the operational level; and (3) obtaining productivity dynamics from the BIM-integrated simulation. To validate our framework, we applied it to a structural steel model; this was due to the significance of steel erections. By integrating BIM with construction operation simulations, we were able to create reliable construction plans that adapted to project changes.

However, coverage of the theory of BIM diffusion (which combines contextual and technical issues of the applications) remains scant and underdeveloped. Compatibility is one of the key contextual factors of Diffusion of Innovation theory that involves predicting BIM adopters' behaviours and identifying what components require extra effort for successful BIM implementation. However, this important theoretical concept has not been developed in pertinent BIM literature nor used correctly to extend existing knowledge because compatibility variables are not understood in a construction context. This seriously impedes the correct usage of BIM in construction. This study systematically and critically reviews BIM compatibility (BIM-COM) literature to distinguish compatibility issues at the organisational level and the concept of interoperability at the technical level. A sample of 57 out of the 131 articles constituted secondary data and each paper represented the unit of analysis. Bibliographic analysis techniques were used to identify co-authoring network and contents' concentration in the created bibliography. Content analysis and text mining approaches were employed using a thematic clustering analysis for grouping authors and themes within articles. The findings illustrate that the concept of compatibility is surprisingly poorly understood and often overlooked in the literature. The paper argues that interoperability issues prevail as the key practical barrier to BIM implementation. The paper identifies a large knowledge gap in terms of improving compatibility measures, which should be employed by innovators to assess their BIM applications before they offer it to construction companies.

However, in-depth investigations of the stages of the BIM adoption process and the drivers, factors and determinants affecting such stages are still lacking. A comprehensive classification and integration of adoption drivers and factors is absent as these are disjointedly identified across disparate studies.

Therefore, it is important to study the design of buildings, especially high-rise buildings, so as to achieve lower carbon emissions. The carbon emissions of a building consist of embodied carbon from the production of construction materials and operational carbon from energy consumption during daily operation (e.g., air-conditioning and lighting). While most of the previous studies concentrated mainly on either embodied or operational carbon, an integrated analysis of both types of carbon emissions can improve the sustainable design of buildings. Therefore, this paper presents a holistic framework using building information modeling (BIM) technology in order to enhance the sustainable low carbon design of high-rise buildings. BIM provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of buildings that can be integrated with various environmental modeling approaches to achieve a holistic design and assessment of low carbon buildings. In a case study, the proposed framework is examined to evaluate the embodied and operational carbon in a high-rise residential building due to various envelope designs. The results demonstrate how the BIM framework provides a decision support basis for evaluating the key carbon emission sources throughout a building's life cycle and exploring more environmentally sustainable measures to improve the built environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049298997

Prima facie significant synergies have been reported between these two paradigms. It is foreseen that when tapped and adopted in unison, these paradigms may yield additional benefits for the construction projects. This synergy is investigated in this research. Further this study identifies and proposes Building Information Modelling (BIM) as an enabler for gaining lean and green project outcomes. The study uses crisp set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) method for exploring the causal combinations of different BIM capabilities and asserts that causal combinations of four BIM capabilities: MEP system modelling, energy and environment analysis, constructability analysis and structural analysis, when implemented on construction projects can lead to lean and green outcomes.

If so, how, and to what extent? Purpose: to test a prototype system in the field, measure and monitor its impact, and evaluate and discuss the implications. Research Method: we have implemented an early prototype of a novel workflow management information system for construction, called ‘KanBIM’, and tested it on a large residential construction site in three stages. Findings: the main significance of the results lies in the site personnel’s positive experience with the system and their observations of the ways in which it could influence the behavior and productivity of crews. These included recognition of the effect the system had in encouraging well-informed discussion and negotiation between crews concerning coordination of work. Limitations: although PPC and other quantitative measures were collected, the duration of the field tests and the depth of integration in company information systems insufficient to provide conclusive results. Implications: while the results are positive and indicate the value of BIM-enabled process flow control, further development and testing is needed. Value for researchers and practitioners: the prototype and the findings are an essential guide for future development of lean process flow control systems.

A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT. DT is a virtual and authoritative representation of physical manufacturing resource, since DT includes various models and manufacturing big data of resource. The proposed architecture is illustrated in detail as follows: (1) physical layer, (2) network layer, (3) virtual layer, and (4) application layer. A case of expert fault diagnose for aircraft engine is presented using the proposed information fusion in the architecture. Secondly, this paper proposes an approach of information modeling for CPPS based on AutomationML. Various manufacturing services can be encapsulated and defined in the standardized format (AutomationML), and then the corresponding virtual manufacturing resources (DTs) will be integrated into CPPS. Finally, this paper describes a case of information modeling for blisk machining and demonstrates the modeling approach in real-life scenarios for support manufacturing resource sharing via DT.

However, the performance of relevant algorithms on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data sets have not been comparatively evaluated, when such data sets are increasingly being used for construction purposes due to their capability of providing volumetric information of objects. This study aims to suggest appropriate building change detection algorithms based on a comparative evaluation of the performance of five selected algorithms including three pixel-based algorithms, Digital Surface Model differencing (DSMd), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML), and two point-based change detection algorithms, namely Cloud to Cloud (C2C) and Multiple Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2). The algorithms were applied on two-point cloud samples from the same areas, and the results of pixel-based change detection algorithms indicate that the SVM algorithm could operate satisfactorily when noise is present in the data but could not reliably quantify the magnitudes of building height changes. The DSMd algorithm can derive the magnitudes of building height change, but it produces a high level of noise in the result and influences the change detection reliability. Therefore, an integration of DSMd and SVM was applied to determine the magnitudes of change and significantly reduce the noise in the results. Among point-based algorithms, M3C2 algorithm is able to show the magnitudes of building height changes and differentiate between new and demolished objects, while C2C can not fully satisfy the evaluation criteria. The authors recommend evaluation of these algorithms using additional temporal data sets and in various urban areas.

This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt.

The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas.

In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified.

The flip side of a lidar point cloud is its massive size and therefore prolonged time for data processing. Our research aims to develop an efficient framework for as-built modelling in terms of time, cost and performance. For this, we collected lidar point clouds using two different data collection methods (i.e. mobile and terrestrial lidar systems with a few centimetre level accuracy) and constructed solid 3-dimensional models of a building. The procedures of creating asbuilt models from both data acquisition methods are compared to understand the capability of each for automatic building information modelling. In order to create as-built models, a framework consisting of eight key stages from data capturing to constructing the building information model is developed. It was found that the framework using mobile lidar enables contractors to create as-built models for complex objects in a timely manner, whereas the framework using terrestrial lidar provides us with more accurate as-built information models. The implementation results of the two frameworks using mobile and terrestrial lidar systems vary between 5-30 mm and 1-45 mm, respectively. It is anticipated that the proposed study becomes a step forward to full automation of lidar-based building information modelling.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912557418

It applies the job demands–resources model to examine the effects of problem-solving demands and job resources (training, participation in decision-making, and line manager support) on employee engagement and exhaustion in a Chinese manufacturer. It examines previously untested interactions and shows that these job resources created a “buffering effect” in the relationship between problem-solving demands and exhaustion. It also shows a “coping effect” because the relationship between resources and engagement was strengthened as problem-solving demands increased. Rather than being uniformly positive or negative, the results suggest that the overall impact of lean production on worker well-being is likely to depend on the ways in which managers create scope for worker involvement in decision-making, target resources to the specific job demands, and adjust resource levels to the degree of these demands. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052389444

Despite the pioneering prefabrication efforts of electrical contractors, there is still no clear understanding of the determinants of electrical prefabrication feasibility in terms of supply chain collaboration and surrounding industry requirements. Accordingly, this paper presents the development of prediction models of prefabrication feasibility for electrical contractors. The research tasks of this study were performed in three main phases. The first phase included various data collection tasks, including conducting semistructured interviews, providing an online questionnaire, and obtaining relevant local economic data of the respondents' metropolitan areas. The second phase involved the utilization of the collected questionnaire responses and economic data to develop logistic regression models that relate the prefabrication feasibility to its statistically significant determinants. The third phase involved validating the developed models by assessing their prediction accuracy and performing extensive sensitivity analysis of their determinants. The findings of this study should prove useful to electrical contractors who need to obtain data-driven assessment of prefabrication feasibility considering their business attributes and surrounding industry parameters. This study presents the two main contributions to the study field of construction prefabrication. First, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on four industry-related determinants: regional economic growth, industry competition, labor cost rate, and worker union resistance. Second, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on two main internal firm-related determinants: building information modeling capability and supply coordination with vendors. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954471161

Design/methodology/approach - To address the need to consider both vendors and customers in the innovation diffusion process and the need for in-depth cross-sectional studies, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 147 participants including 85 vendors and 62 customers of modern construction technologies at company, project and operational levels in Australia and North America. Thematic analysis and an analytic hierarchy process illustrate the critical role of both customers and vendors in the diffusion process of modern equipment technologies. Findings - A new conceptual model is presented which classifies modern equipment technology customers into four categories: visionaries (group I); innovators (group II); pragmatists (group III); and conservatives (group IV) based on the way in which they interact with vendors in the innovation diffusion process. The results also reveal that there is a significant emotional/affective aspect of innovation diffusion decisions which has not been recognised in previous research.

In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a Lean-BIM planning framework by integrating the Last Planner System and BIM. The development of the proof of concept of the BIM-Lean planning framework was undertaken by comparing two case studies: one using only LPS and the other using LPS and BIM. We followed construction activities related to rough work in two comparable building projects as part of the field office staff. We gathered project data and analysed and compared planning procedures in both projects. Data collected included: Weekly and lookahead planning meetings analyses; design requests for information (RFI); and LPS metrics. We then used flowcharts to document both planning processes and the improved planning proposal, and also, integrated the different planning levels. Results show that the coordinated use of LPS and BIM generates an increase in PPC, a decrease in reasons for non-compliance, a shortening of the meeting durations, and a decrease in the total number of design RFIs. The improved planning proposal combines LPS+BIM and facilitates the interaction of a larger and diverse number of project stakeholders around BIM manipulation in planning meetings.

Consequently, BIM applications are claimed to provide more reliable working practice for Quantity Surveyors especially in establishing their cost estimates. Despite its well-known advantages that drive BIM employment worldwide, its usage in Malaysia is still at infancy level, with the lack of implementation by the Quantity Surveyors.

In recent years, safety-related information or cognition studies have become new extension point in safety science. The researchers did not make any breakthroughs in the mechanism analysis of safety information science, because the essential process is not understood by researchers. Obviously, establishing safety information science is irreversible and critical. Therefore, it is theoretically and practically significant to establish and discuss the foundation of safety information science. Firstly, the safety systems should follow three levels: scale decomposition, dimension decomposition and research field. Then, from the perspective of spatial order, a systematic cognitive sequence of safety information and a Five Areas Four Belts spatial order model were established. Thirdly, the meaning and basic connotation of safety information are clarified. In addition, from the view of the combination between safety information dissemination and behavior cognition, the Safety Information Cognition model is constructed according to the general model of safety information cognition and Principle of system decomposition. Besides, the accident mechanism of 5-layers distortion and 4-times delay, as well as the general procedures of injury accidents were proposed. Finally, the worth of safety science model research for the future development was summarized. This paper contains a series of achievements, including system decomposition method, safety information cognition process and the cause mechanism and prevention strategies of accidents or pollution information. The conclusion shows that the information communication theory, the cognitive model and the safety information law can deepen the understanding of the safety and environment system and provide new ways for the further study of the safety and cleaner production.

Virtual design and building information modeling play indispensable role in improving the project performance. The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits and challenges of Virtual Information Modeling as a novel information and communication technology method on project management knowledge areas in the construction industry. Using one-sample T test with Kolmogorov-Smirnov approach, we analyzed data collected from structured questionnaire survey involving project managers working at architecture, engineering and construction industries in Tehran, Iran. The results with 64% response rate suggest that the most important benefits and challenges of using Virtual Information Modeling are related to the area of integration, and implementation of Virtual Information Modeling has significant impact on project integration management knowledge in compare with other project management knowledge areas. Thus, integration should be considered a top priority for construction companies implementing Virtual Information Modeling in their projects. Policymakers should understand that careful management of virtual information is essential for improving the performance of projects and enhancing the process efficiency. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048424463

The traditional method of conducting structural design is of sequential engineering concept like point-based design in which designers determine the initial design plan based on designer's experience and judgment and then proceed with detailed design. However, Set-based Design (SBD) of concurrent engineering concept is lean design that eliminates wasting elements and increases the potential for the improvement of productivity in overall project standpoint by sharing information and collaborating with relevant fields. In addition, S-BIM (Structural Building Information Modeling) provides an environment flexible to exchange information and collaborate with relevant field for the execution of SBD. In this study, on the basis of S-BIM, a SBD procedure is established and a case study is performed with the procedure. The case study shows the proposed SBD procedure has a high efficiency in the selection of the global optimal alternatives of structural floor systems considering the constructability, structural capacity and economical feasibility simultaneously. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

An opportunity might be that all of the aforementioned methods are hardly well enough integrated in a systematic way for purposes in knowledge-based decision making. A prominent example is that LC and associated simulation games in academic or professional education still rely much on manual data input and analysis. Proposed is a learning platform (a serious gaming environment) that teaches the concept of permanent availability of up-to-date actual performance data sets using an integrated BIM-IoT-LC approach. While the platform builds upon existing cloud-based BIM tools and well-known takt planning and takt control principles, a novel IoT platform was developed that rapidly elevates the gathering and transformation from data to information to knowledge while the participants play the game. The platform was tested in several academic learning environments around the world. Findings demonstrate the participants understand the important role of technology in practical applications. By extending their experiences from traditional LC simulation games with the BIM and IoT components, specifically, they were able to interact and collaborate more closely. Access to just-in-real-time project status information on smart wearable devices and large display screens helped improving the expected project execution timeline while reducing certain waste factors. One limitation that was discovered is the tight integration of the developed technology into new learning curricula that aim at digitalizing construction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091047447

Building Information Modelling (BIM) knows as a promising platform that can solve those problems. BIM has been developed at a rapid pace to cope with the increasing complexity and difficulty of project management. The construction players especially contractors still unclear about what BIM truly is, how and when to use it. The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent of which use of BIM producing potential benefits across construction project life phase. The exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 56 contractors (G7) across Klang Valley. The data of were analysed using descriptive analysis which are the frequency analysis, average mean and cross-tab analysis.

While the two are conceptually independent and separate, there appear to be synergies between them that extend beyond the essentially circumstantial nature. This was investigated by compiling a detailed listing of lean construction principles and BIM functionalities which are relevant from this perspective through detailed literature survey and interview with experts. Detailed questionnaire was developed based on the data collected from literature reviews and expert interviews, there by linking the lean principles with BIM functions by framing questions to rate the applicability of BIM in lean construction principles. The questionnaire was then distributed among various professionals in the construction industries in Chennai using software's under BIM. Finally based on the data collected through questionnaire survey a research analysis was carried out using statistical software to determine the weight age of each factor showing the possibility of the interaction between lean and BIM was then compiled.

However, there has been a lack of focus on the value that can be generated by using BIM during the design and construction phase. In this paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction processes? A literature review established the main areas to further address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases and into the construction and O&M phases with the use of structured data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further developed. The work also discovers and investigates how an academic institution can develop work methods through on-going development, tests and evaluation in collaboration with practitioners from the AEC industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060737440
