With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960269657

These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in realworld learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for realworld learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant realworld learning models including project and problembased learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design realworld learning opportunities. Findings – A “functional and progressive” model of realworld learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying concepts and methods from the field of sustainability. Practical implications – The paper offers examples of realworld learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students. Originality/value – The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how realworld learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability.

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity.

By using probit regressive analyses, the thermal neutrality and thermal preference of students occurred at 26.3 °C ET * and 24.7 °C ET *, respectively. Responses from those students suggest a wider acceptable temperature range for occupants in Taiwan. The margins of the acceptable zones obtained from direct and indirect acceptability assessing methods are 21.1-29.8 °C ET * and 24.2-29.3 °C ET *, respectively.

Based on this perceived research need, the purpose of this article is to present how transformation in learning in education for sustainability requires the commitment of Faculty and the engament of students. To do this, a set of qualitative case studies were used in higher education institutions across seven countries (Brazil, Serbia, Latvia, South Africa, Spain, Syria, UK). The findings revealed that the concept of education for sustainable development has not been sufficiently integrated into the concept of transformation in higher education institutions. It also found that to enhance sustainability in the curricula, academics should develop collaborative approaches, and discuss how to redesign their own disciplines, and how to appreciate the epistemology and multicultural vision of sustainability, both as a topic, and as a field of education research. It was further found that reflections of the academics on their own values are crucial for developing the transformative potential of students as agents of a sustainable future.

The questionnaire was applied in autumn, winter and spring in classrooms of the University of Perugia, Terni and Pavia. During the campaign, all data needed to calculate both Fanger and Wray comfort indices were acquired by instrumental surveys and questionnaire compilation. By means of results' analysis of both questionnaires and measurements, the following couple of parameters (derived from Fanger and Wray) were correlated: Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) versus the difference between the Equivalent Uniform Temperature and the Comfort Uniform Temperature (Teu - Tu) and the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) versus the absolute value of the same difference between temperatures (|Teu - Tu|). For the first couple of parameters, a linear correlation was found while for the second one a second-degree polynomial relation was obtained. Better correlation was found for measurement data rather than questionnaire results. Finally values of Operative Temperature T0 and Equivalent Uniform Temperature Teu, obtained for each single experimental survey, were compared, observing a very good agreement between the two quantities, with differences that exceed 0.1 K only for a few number of values.

This paper takes a statistical approach to assess ambient, spatial, and technological attributes that can be found in higher education classrooms through an online survey conducted in six classrooms in a university. The paper provides insight for future evaluation of higher education learning environments by linking two Likert scales: one rating student satisfaction with classroom attributes and the other rating the impact of these attributes on student performance, and by analyzing the relationships between reported perceptions and student evaluations of different conditions. The results revealed that student perceptions rely heavily on spatial attributes, specifically visibility and furniture, and ambient attributes, specifically air quality and temperature, which are highly impacted by the design, management and maintenance of classrooms. The paper also investigated the impacts of non-classroom factors, including gender, seating location, cumulative GPA, college year and expected course grade, on student perceptions of learning environments.

Furthermore, the information about facility components should be managed throughout the lifecycle and be easily accessible for all players in the AECOO industry. BIM is emerging as a method of creating, sharing, exchanging and managing the information throughout the lifecycle between all the stakeholders. RFID, on the other hand, has emerged as an automatic data collection and information storage technology, and has been used in different applications in AECOO. This research proposes permanently attaching RFID tags to facility components where the memory of the tags is populated with accumulated lifecycle information of the components taken from a standard BIM database. This information is used to enhance different processes throughout the lifecycle. In addition, this research suggests storing other types of BIM information (e.g., floor plans) on RFID tags which is not necessarily related to the components themselves. Having BIM data chunks stored on tags provides a distributed database of BIM and allows data access for different players who do not have real-time access to a central database.

It has been recognized that universities play a pivotal role in promoting sustainability principles, contributing to the paradigm shift toward a more sustainable present and future. Campus sustainability-commonly understood in a broad sense that includes the physical, educational (teaching, curricula, research), and institutional dimensions-is an evolving study field, as indicated by the growing number of articles in academic journals, conferences, awards, and books (like the present one) dedicated to the subject. From the academic point of view, the emergent fields of sustainability science and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) have advanced the efforts of mainstreaming sustainability and implementing concrete practices in universities. But despite some progress and good examples, only a few institutions follow a SD implementation process holistically. A one-sided trend of “going green,” driven by market requirements, marketing advantages, and economic benefits, increases the risks of greenwashing. Reductionist models and misconceptions may cause sustainability initiatives to be wrongly reduced to single aspects of SD like environmental initiatives, losing meaning and credibility. This chapter addresses the question of what role the emerging fields of sustainability science and ESD can play within the transition to more sustainable universities. It aims to contribute to a more holistic perception of SD and examines some of the trends being observed in the higher education sector. Universities are challenged to reflect about educational objectives and strategic goals in their sustainability implementation processes, if they aim to educate the academic community beyond eco-efficiency and recycling. Esd and sustainability science are normative academic fields, action-oriented and close to society.

The novelty of this model is that it addresses the need to present indoor environment performance ratings alongside energy performance certification and help determine by how much energy efficiency imperatives sacrifice human comfort. The model is based on the IEQ index which was developed from literature. The IEQ index is an expression which was derived from four contributing factors namely Thermal Comfort, Indoor Air quality (IAQ), Acoustic Comfort and Lighting. The relative weightings of each of the contributing factors were derived by fitting a multiple regression model to questionnaire data obtained from 68 occupants of two selected case study buildings in the UK. During questionnaire administration, measurement of indoor environment variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, illuminance, CO 2 concentrations and A-weighted sound pressure level was carried out in order to validate occupant responses. An empirical expression more suited to the air-conditioned offices in the UK was developed and the end result was a computer based program called the Indoor Environment Quality Assessment Tool (IEQAT).

Based on a large database of values resulted from simulations, multiple non-linear regression models were obtained in order to predict variables such as operative temperature, indoor sound pressure level, indoor average illuminance and specific energy consumption. A predictive model for IEQ index is proposed as a function of the four quality indexes (air quality, thermal, acoustic and visual comfort).

These advances allow physical learning spaces with embedded computing capabilities to provide an augmented self-aware learning experience. In this paper, we aim at developing a novel ubiquitous learning model within a pervasive smart campus environment. The goal of our research consists of identifying the steps towards building such an environment and the involved learning processes. We define a model of a smart campus, and advocate learning practices in the light of new paradigms such as context-awareness, ubiquitous learning, pervasive environment, resource virtualization, autonomic computing and adaptive learning. We reveal a comprehensive architecture that defines the various components and their inter-operations in a smart educational environment. The smart campus approach is presented as a composition of ambient learning spaces, which are environments where physical learning resources are augmented with digital and social services. We present a model of these spaces to harness future ubiquitous learning environments. One of the distinguished features of this model is the ability to unleash the instructional value of surrounding physical structures. Another one is the provision of a personalized learning agenda when moving across these ambient learning environments. To achieve these goals, we profile learners and augment physical campus structures to advocate context-aware learning processes. We suggest a social community platform for knowledge sharing which involves peer learners, domain experts as well as campus physical resources. Within this pervasive social scope, learners are continuously immersed in a pedagogically supported experiential learning loop as a persuasive approach to learning. A learning path, which responds to learners’ goals and qualifications, autonomously guides learners in achieving their objectives in the proposed smart campus. We evaluated our ubiquitous learning approach to assert the performance of these building blocks in the proposed smart campus model.

As a consequence, smart campuses and universities need to provide connectivity to IoT nodes and gateways, and deploy architectures that allow for offering not only a good communications range through the latest wireless and wired technologies, but also reduced energy consumption to maximize IoT node battery life. In addition, such architectures have to consider the use of technologies like blockchain, which are able to deliver accountability, transparency, cyber-security and redundancy to the processes and data managed by a university. This article reviews the state of the start on the application of the latest key technologies for the development of smart campuses and universities. After defining the essential characteristics of a smart campus/university, the latest communications architectures and technologies are detailed and the most relevant smart campus deployments are analyzed. Moreover, the use of blockchain in higher education applications is studied. Therefore, this article provides useful guidelines to the university planners, IoT vendors and developers that will be responsible for creating the next generation of smart campuses and universities. © 2019 by the authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075239890

BIM has been extended beyond 3D geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios, such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management decisions. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049640762

This study correlates thermal energy consumption with the overall occupant acceptance of IEQ in some air-conditioned offices. An empirical expression of an IEQ index associated with thermal comfort, indoor air quality, aural and visual comfort is used to benchmark the offices. Employing input parameters obtained from the building stocks of Hong Kong, the office portfolios regarding the thermal energy consumption and the IEQ index are determined by Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, an energy-to-acceptance ratio and an energy-to-IEQ improvement ratio are proposed to measure the performance of energy consumption for the IEQ in the air-conditioned offices. The ratios give the thermal energy consumption corresponding to a desirable percentage of IEQ acceptances and to an IEQ upgrade, respectively. The results showed a non-linear increasing trend of annual thermal energy consumption for IEQ improvement at the offices of higher IEQ benchmarks. The thermal energy consumption for visual comfort and indoor air quality would also be significant in these offices.

The performance of this logger has been validated by large-scale surveys in air-conditioned buildings in Hong Kong using the appropriate international standards and protocols. The compactness of the logger made it versatile for use in the study of total IEQ. It renders the development of a total IEQ comfort model possible.

To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis. The overarching aim of this paper is to improve the efficiency of facility management (FM) and utilize BIM data accessible during building's lifecycle. The university engineering building equipped with a monitoring system for tracking and collecting various building-related parameters is used for demonstration of the developed software technologies.

However, the different elements that compose the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) layer of a Smart Grid are usually conceived as isolated systems that typically result in rigid hardware architectures which are hard to interoperate, manage, and to adapt to new situations. If the Smart Grid paradigm has to be presented as a solution to the demand for distributed and intelligent energy management system, it is necessary to deploy innovative IT infrastructures to support these smart functions. One of the main issues of Smart Grids is the heterogeneity of communication protocols used by the smart sensor devices that integrate them. The use of the concept of the Web of Things is proposed in this work to tackle this problem. More specifically, the implementation of a Smart Grid’s Web of Things, coined as the Web of Energy is introduced. The purpose of this paper is to propose the usage of Web of Energy by means of the Actor Model paradigm to address the latent deployment and management limitations of Smart Grids. Smart Grid designers can use the Actor Model as a design model for an infrastructure that supports the intelligent functions demanded and is capable of grouping and converting the heterogeneity of traditional infrastructures into the homogeneity feature of the Web of Things.

Assessing the savings achievable requires an analysis of a range of influencing factors, such as house type and age, location and occupancy patterns. Door opening has a major influence due to the impact on air exchange between heated and unheated zones in a house, so this was also considered. Annual simulations were carried out on dynamic models of the thermal and air flow interactions, for all combinations of influencing factors, to compare the potential energy savings of zoned versus non-zoned control.

In particular, the quantity energy rate density-the rate of energy flow per unit mass-can be used to explicate in a consistent, uniform, and unifying way a huge collection of diverse complex systems observed throughout Nature. Operationally, those systems able to utilize optimal amounts of energy tend to survive and those that cannot are non-randomly eliminated. © 2015 by the authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952685598

We propose to use a novel Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, namely, the Social IoT (SIoT), to enable appliance-level metering (submetering) and to create prosumer communities dynamically. We use the term Social Internet of Energy (SIoE) to refer to the integration between prosumers and devices via social relationships. This article explores the diverse technologies that will enable the SIoE. On the one hand, we explore the different aspects and value propositions of the SIoT, applying this novel paradigm to the creation of prosumer communities. On the other hand, we explore demand side management, its synergy with SIoT and the properties and challenges that may arise. Concretely, in this article, we aim at grouping prosumers by their energy load shape compatibility and then reschedule intragroup load shapes. We propose a clustering model and we develop two clustering heuristics to distribute prosumers among prosumer community group and one peak-to-average ratio (PAR) prediction heuristic in order to reduce the PAR and the amplitude of energy peaks per cluster. Then, on the basis of a real dataset, we perform simulations and analyze and discuss the results, paving the way for further research. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076727457

Academia as well as industry is equally fascinated by this disruptive technology. The IoT research and implementation have succeeded securing their place in numerous domains including, but not limited to, business, transportation and logistics, health care, smart cities, and agriculture. Conceptual modeling is pivotal to the design and implementation of a system. Various modeling approaches have been used for a variety of the IoT applications and case studies. In this paper, we examine various innovative applications of the existing conceptual modeling approaches for the IoT. We analyze the use of these approaches against different concerns in isolation as well as in mutual combination for the IoT. We also define a set of terminologies that we frequently encounter in this manuscript and those likely to be used while adopting proposed modeling approaches for the IoT scenarios. This study also attempts to reconcile different modeling approaches toward a unified modeling system. For this purpose, we map various conceptual modeling approaches against different layers of functional model of the IoT reference architecture. There is also a scenario in the end of the paper which elaborates the use of different modeling approaches in hierarchy for a complex IoT system. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083574797

It is therefore crucial for classrooms to provideoptimal conditions for the development of activities inherent to education, which includethe quality of classroom acoustics.The quality of transmitted and perceived verbal information is linked intrinsically tothe acoustic performance of the room, which in turn involves the observance of severalspeech quality descriptors - Reverberation Time, Speech Transmission Index, Definitionand Centre Time. This chapter on Classroom Acoustics describes the techniques requiredfor in situ measurements of these parameters, which are crucial for verbalcommunication. These parameters, which are based on national and internationaltechnical standards, seek to establish reference values in order to achieve good acousticsin classrooms. Another tool presented is computational simulation, which enablesacoustic solutions for classrooms to be tested while still in the design phase, as well asinterventions in existing buildings.As a necessary part of the search for optimal classroom acoustics, real cases arepresented whose objects of study are university classrooms. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Our approach tackles this lack of understanding by applying techniques developed by complex systems scientists. Functional topology graphs, which describe the interactions between system parts, are used to represent different implementations of clustering in WSNs. We employ a complexity metric - functional complexity (CF) - to quantify the potential of the functional topology to transport information. Our analysis highlights the trade-off between scalability and energy efficiency, showing that higher values of CF indicate higher scalability and lower energy efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027844162

Energy users are no longer passive actors; the prosumer is expected to be the primary agent in the Future Grid. Demand Side Management refers to the management of energy production and consumption at the demand side, and there seems to be an increasing concern about the scalability of Demand Side Management services. The creation of prosumer communities leveraging the Smart Grid to improve energy production and consumption patterns has been proposed in the literature, and several works concerned with scalability of Demand Side Management services group prosumers to improve Demand Side Management scalability. In our previous work, we coin the term Social Internet of Energy to refer to the integration between devices, prosumers and groups of prosumers via social relationships. In this work, we develop an algorithm to coordinate the different clusters we create using the clustering method by load profile compatibility (instead of similarity). Our objective is to explore the possibilities of the cluster-by-compatibility heuristic we proposed in our previous work. We perform experiments using synthetic and real datasets. Results show that we can obtain a global reduction in Peak-to-Average Ratio with datasets containing up to 200 prosumers and creating up to 6 Prosumer Community Groups, and imply that those Prosumer Community Groups can perform load rescheduling semi-autonomously and in parallel with each other. © 2019 by the authors.

In general, these concepts are modelled employing different techniques which give an inexplicit vision on the system. Therefore, all concepts must be carefully modelled using the same approach to avoid contradiction and guarantee system homogeneity and correctness. However, developing a computing system that includes all these concepts using the same approach is not an easy task and requires a perfect understanding of the system’s behaviour. In this paper, we contribute as stepwise towards proposing an approach to model the most important concepts of complex adaptive systems while ensuring homogeneity and the correctness of models. For this aim, we present five standard agent-based models formalizing agent properties, reaction, interaction, adaptation, and evolution. These models are adapted to all cases of complex adaptive systems since they include an abstract description of these concepts. To implement our approach formally, we choose the Event-B method due to the strong assurance of bugs’ absence that it guarantees. Besides, it supports horizontal and vertical refinement which facilitates the specification process. Furthermore, the approach of this paper addresses the very abstract level of modelling which expand the use of this approach to other formal methods and tools.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079708020
