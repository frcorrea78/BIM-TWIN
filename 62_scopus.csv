First an overview about the subject area is presented. This is followed by a review of papers published in the last 10 years that examine the various sub-areas of research related to human thermal comfort. Some remarkable works about both the Fanger's and adaptive thermal comfort models are also discussed. This review does not contain simulation works and/or experimental studies without subjective results of people. As a result of the literature review, 466 articles were classified and grouped to form the body of this article. The article examines standards, indoor experiments in controlled environments (climate chamber) and semi-controlled environments, indoor field studies in educational, office, residential and other building types, productivity, human physiological models, outdoor and semi-outdoor field studies. Several research topics are also addressed involving naturally ventilated, air-conditioned and mixed-mode buildings, personalized conditioning systems and the influence of personal (age, weight, gender, thermal history) and environmental (controls, layout, air movement, humidity, among others) variables on thermal comfort. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939477479

However, BIM and IoT integration research are still in nascent stages, there is a need to understand the current situation of BIM and IoT device integration. This paper conducts a comprehensive review with the intent to identify common emerging areas of application and common design patterns in the approach to tackling BIM-IoT device integration along with an examination of current limitations and predictions of future research directions. Altogether, 97 papers from 14 AEC related journals and databases in other industry over the last decade were reviewed. Several prevalent domains of application namely Construction Operation and Monitoring, Health & Safety Management, Construction Logistic & Management, and Facility Management were identified. The authors summarized 5 integration methods with description, examples, and discussion. These integration methods are utilizing BIM tools’ APIs and relational database, transform BIM data into a relational database using new data schema, create new query language, using semantic web technologies and hybrid approach. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and web services-based strategies for BIM and IoT integration, establishing information integration & management standards, solving interoperability issue, and cloud computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060885881

In today's BIM-based energy modeling practice, thermal properties are mainly derived from generic building construction types in BIM. However, for energy modeling of existing buildings, such assumptions are often inaccurate as they do not account for diminishing thermal resistances of building materials instigated by their deteriorations. To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes. By associating these measurements with their corresponding elements in gbXML, thermal properties of the BIM elements are automatically updated. Our experiments in real-world residential and instructional buildings show how actual thermal properties can be automatically associated with BIM elements and updated in gbXML. The proposed method shortens the gap between architectural information in BIM and the actual data needed for energy performance simulation, and enables reliable BIM-based energy analysis for retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, and retrofit. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers.The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912051144

Yet, their performance remains a contested topic. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25% outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062402324

If these models are generated from laser scanning point clouds automatically textured with thermographic and RGB images, their capacities are exponentially increased, since also their visualization and not only the consultation of their data increases the information available from the building. Since laser scanning, infrared thermography and photography are techniques that acquire information of the object as-is, the resulting BIM includes information on the real condition of the building in the moment of inspection, consequently helping to a more efficient planning of the rehabilitation works, enabling the repair of the most severe faults.

However, striking a balance between reducing building energy use and providing adequate comfort levels is a significant challenge.

Results: The results of a case study revealed that BLDF supports design stakeholders to better perceive and optimize lighting conditions in order to achieve a higher degree of satisfaction in terms of lighting design and energy savings for future occupants. Conclusions: The developed system utilizes an interactive and immersive virtual reality (VR) environment to simulate daylighting and the illumination of artificial lights in buildings and visualizes realistic VR scenes using head mounted displays (HMD). BLDF allows users to interact with design objects, to change them, and to compare multiple design scenarios, and provides real-time lighting quality and energy consumption feedback. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044792002

Three methods are mainly recognized for its assessment. Two of them based on standardized methodologies, face the problem by considering the indoor environment in steady-state conditions (PMV and PPD) and users as active subjects whose thermal perception is influenced by outdoor climatic conditions (adaptive approach). The latter method is the starting point to investigate thermal comfort from an overall perspective by considering endogenous variables besides the traditional physical and environmental ones. Following this perspective, the paper describes the results of an in-field investigation of thermal conditions through the use of nearable and wearable solutions, parametric models and machine learning techniques. The aim of the research is the exploration of the reliability of IoT-based solutions combined with advanced algorithms, in order to create a replicable framework for the assessment and improvement of user thermal satisfaction. For this purpose, an experimental test in real offices was carried out involving eight workers.

Acquisition of sensor data of a building is essential to ensure the improvement of the indoor thermal environment for the occupants. The environmental sensor technologies together with Building Information Modeling (BIM) are tools for assessing/analyzing the performance of a building. Although BIM has a potential to verify thermal performance by using a BIM database, integrating the surface-heat of building envelopes and sensing data has not been fully explored in the existing BIM. BIM requires tools to enable building professionals to effectively detect the location of thermal defects and analyze the thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort by accommodating environmental information to be used in the analysis process. Therefore, this research presents a novel method for integrating time-stamped 3D thermal data in the BIM. In the proposed method, the BIM model is integrated with spatio-temporal thermal and air temperature data. Visual scripting is used for extracting and then mapping spatio-temporal thermal data to a 3D BIM model. The proposed system converts the collected thermal images into numeric surface temperatures, integrates collected environmental data in the BIM, calculates thermal comfort variables, such as mean radiant temperature (MRT), and assesses the thermal comfort level for various locations inside the building. The applicability of the proposed method is validated in a real-world case study.

However, despite the significant impacts of such energy consumption on the environment, the lack of thermal comfort among occupants is a common problem that can lead to health complications and reduced productivity. To address this problem, it is particularly important to understand occupants’ thermal comfort in real-time to dynamically control the environment. This study investigates an infrared thermal camera network to extract skin temperature features and predict occupants’ thermal preferences at flexible distances and angles. This study distinguishes from existing methods in two ways: (1) the proposed method is a non-intrusive data collection approach which does not require human participation or personal devices; (2) it uses low-cost thermal cameras and RGB-D sensors which can be rapidly reconfigured to adapt to various settings and has little or no hardware infrastructure dependency. The proposed camera network is verified using the facial skin temperature collected from 16 subjects in a multi-occupancy experiment. The results show that all 16 subjects observed a statistically higher skin temperature as the room temperature increases. The variations in skin temperature also correspond to the distinct comfort states reported by the subjects. The post-experiment evaluation suggests that the networked thermal cameras have a minimal interruption of building occupants.

On the other hand, indoor greenery has been introduced to buildings as a method for adjusting the thermal condition. Creating a VR environment, which can realistically and intuitively visualize a thermal simulation model is very time consuming and the resulting VR environment created by 3D computer graphics objects is disconnected from the reality and does not allow design stakeholders to experience the feelings of the real world.

To achieve this, the occupants' thermal comfort needs to be assessed in real-time with minimal inconvenience to the occupants. Whereas prior work has examined non-invasive assessment of thermal comfort using sensors aimed at a combination of body parts, this paper explores the extent to which such prediction is possible solely through non-invasive sensors aimed at the face. This is valuable because the face is least likely to be covered or occluded from sensing. The proposed method uses visual sensors to measure bio-signals related to thermal comfort. The sensor data is processed to extract local features from various parts of a face, which are used to model the thermal profile of the occupant. These features are then subject to contrast computations, which are less sensitive to the accuracy of the temperature readings. Using these features, a machine learning framework is proposed to predict the occupants’ personal thermal comfort. Data from 22 subjects recorded in an office setup with constant room temperature and fixed clothing insulation were used to test the proposed method. Three groups of subjects were exposed to different room temperatures (20 °C, 24 °C, and 28 °C respectively). The thermal comfort assessment showed that the proposed automated features can predict personal thermal comfort with 76% accuracy.

This interface is potentiated by a BIM-based interface presenting real-time data of the building. The solution, called 3i buildings - Intelligent, Interactive, and Immersive Buildings, is a tool to monitor and manage smart buildings, as well as optimize users experience, energy consumptions and environment quality. This is achieved by a grid of sensors and devices that continuously gather information (structural conditions of the building, occupancy, comfort of occupants, energy consumptions and CO2, COV's and Humidity levels, etc.), which is processed by predictive models able to learn over time. The 3D representation of the models allows managers to take advantage of the virtual environment, by augmenting the facility model and including information about the facility, making it easier and perceptible to users and owners, helping them to make better decisions. To support our research, the system will be installed in three different environments, Luz's hospital, Lisbon Aquarium and Norte Shopping, to test the solution under different conditions, objectives and users. In the first two cases the objectives are to monitor building air quality, consumptions and occupancy and in the Norte Shopping case the objectives are to monitor people flows, interact with tem and help the response in case of crisis according to the adopted emergency plan. These types of systems might help reducing energy consumptions as well as increasing comfort and satisfaction of occupants, maintaining a constant concentration of CO2 and humidity within the facility. The optimized algorithms will allow the system to learn, predicting and reacting to different conditions, giving a more reliable and smooth response to occupants needs. © 2015 The Authors.

Thermal comfort in general refers to temperature and also humidity. However in reality, temperature or humidity is just one of the factors affecting the thermal comfort but not the main measures. Besides, as HVAC control system has the characteristic of time delay, large inertia, and highly nonlinear behaviour, it is difficult to determine the thermal comfort sensation accurately if we use traditional Fanger's PMV index. Hence, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been introduced due to its ability to approximate any nonlinear mapping. Using ANN to train, we can get the input-output mapping of HVAC control system or in other word; we can propose a practical approach to identify thermal comfort of a building. Simulations were carried out to validate and verify the proposed method. Results show that the proposed ANN method can track down the desired thermal sensation for a specified condition space. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881101851

This research describes a new automated methodology with minimal user input which uses a 3D pose estimation technique to map infrared thermographic images directly on a CAD file of the component. This mapping allows direct inspection of the thermal measurements on the CAD file. The methodology is compared with state-of-the-art 3D thermography techniques which use additional hardware like range cameras and 3D scanners to obtain 3D data. In our use cases, the proposed methodology provides a better 3D mapping of the thermal images. Traditional techniques typically rely on multiple sensors with different fields of view. This difference results in a partial overlap of spatial data and thermal data, hence a part of the thermal data is discarded in the 3D mapping. This is in contrast to our methodology which only uses one camera and maps all image-points representing the object to a 3D location. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064457539

A total of six discontinuous conditions for self-regulating ambient temperature were designed with five males and five females. Sleep onset latency and slow wave sleep, from the physiological indices of electroencephalograph, electromyography and electrooculography, measure sleep quality objectively. Results indicate that gender differences in subjective temperature preferences, thermal sensation and sleep quality are reflected by temperature or temperature intervals. In particular, women have a significantly higher temperature range than men. Meanwhile, the temperature sections of males and females corresponding to thermal sensation and sleep quality are summarized under the same thermal resistance. Moreover, the results of temperature difference between men and women on thermal perception and sleep quality showed that the temperature difference of subjective sleep quality coincides with the objective one, but greater than the subjective thermal perception results implying that a greater discrepancy between males and females in sleep thermal physiological needs than during their awake. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092131417

Recently, research on BIM-centered IoT applications has been gaining an increasing momentum. Currently, there exist some major challenges that impede the realization of the synergistic potentials of BIM and IoT. Among them is to maintain an effective semantic interoperability between the BIM and IoT data ecosystems. Indeed, an accurate integration between IoT-enabled raw sensory data and existing BIM-based digital models of facilities requires a profound understanding of contextual clues (time, location, occupants’ profiles, etc.), which are embedded within actual observations derived from IoT sensors. In this paper, a framework is presented for integrating disparate sources of BIM and IoT data through an ontology-based mediation mechanism. This framework enables an integrated access to local sources of BIM and IoT data thorough query-rewriting processes. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, query rewriting examples have been provided in the context of indoor comfort analysis for facility occupants. In the case demonstrations, the geospatial data acts as the main clue for the derivation of semantic dependencies between local instances of BIM and IoT data. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088420709
