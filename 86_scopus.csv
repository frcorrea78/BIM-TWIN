Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed.

A relevant and accepted calculation methodology and baseline to properly evaluate BIM's benefits have not been established, thus there are mixed perspectives and opinions of the benefits of BIM, creating a general misunderstanding of the expected outcomes. The purpose of this paper was to develop a more complete methodology to analyze the benefits of BIM, apply recent projects to this methodology to quantify outcomes, resulting in a more a holistic framework of BIM and its impacts on project efficiency. From the literature, a framework calculation model to determine the value of BIM is developed and presented. The developed model is applied via case studies within a large industrial setting where similar projects are evaluated, some implementing BIM and some with traditional, non-BIM approaches. Cost or investment metrics were considered along with benefit or return metrics. The return metrics were: requests for information, change orders, and duration improvements. The investment metrics were: design and construction costs. The methodology was tested against three separate cases and results on the returns and investments are presented. The findings indicate that in the tool installation department of semiconductor manufacturing, there is a high potential for BIM benefits to be realized.

Few efforts in construction industry have involved facility managers into the design phase. It was suggested that early adoption of facilities management will contribute to reducing the needs for major repairs and alternations that will otherwise occur at the operational phase. There should be an integrated data source providing information support for the building lifecycle. It is envisaged that Building Information Modelling (BIM) would fill the gap by acting as a visual model and a database throughout the building lifecycle. This paper develops a framework of how FM can be considered in design stage through BIM. Based on the framework, the paper explores how BIM will beneficially support FM in the design phase, such as space planning and energy analysis.

Despite the many benefits offered by BIM, its use for facility operations remains significantly limited. The reality is that implementing BIM in large owner organisations is a complex challenge. In particular, a significant barrier to BIM adoption for owners is the challenge of identifying and formalizing the information requirements needed to support model-based project delivery and asset management. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal research project that investigated two large owner organisations in Canada to better understand the process of developing and formulating BIM requirements to support the lifecycle of their assets. Specifically, the objectives were to formalize an iterative approach to the identification and characterization of owner requirements and to develop a conceptual framework that would relate digital and physical products to owner requirements and organisational constructs, to underpin the formalization process. As part of this research an array of requirements documentation were analysed, interviews were performed with numerous facility management personnel, and BIMs from four projects were analysed. A methodology is introduced to support a rigorous and detailed analysis of BIM requirements. The investigation of the owner requirements helped to develop an understanding of the required information content, and its alignment with BIM. Finally the relationships between organisational constructs, owner requirements, and BIM were mapped. As the construction industry shifts towards model-based project delivery, this research will inform owners about how to think about handover of digital facility models, and what to require in models based on their specific needs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027396980

In this stage the optimization potential is still very large, at very low cost. In the latter planning phases the change possibility rapidly decreases with simultaneously increasing costs. The investors and planners are increasingly requiring design tools as decision support instruments, which would enable simulation and optimization of LCC already in the early planning phases. This paper will present a comparative study of three commercial software-tools for LCC-calculation, and test their fitness for the implementation in the early design phases. Using a Case Study of an energy efficient building, LCC were assessed employing the three tools and the deviations of the results were compared. The analysis showed, that the tested tools cannot be employed in the early design phases without adoption and customization, lacking of benchmarks and extensive data representing the largest problem for a reliable LCC calculation and optimization. In further step, a strategy for investors for the assessment of LCC in the architectural competitions as decision support was developed and verified on a real-life project. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926300688

There is a need to establish an up-to-date synthesis on the current status of information exchange and interoperability between BIM and FM systems. After an in-depth review of 113 journal articles published from 2008 to 2018, this study systematically presents (1) a holistic review and critical reflection on the current status of BIM implementation in FM with a focus on information exchange and interoperability, (2) research trends and patterns and (3) research gaps and a future agenda in this area. Through a bibliometric and content review analysis, this paper concludes that the process of information exchange between BIM models and FM systems is not a straightforward process, as software interoperability remains a significant challenge. Bridging this gap requires standardized practical processes to integrate different information sources related to maintenance management, health & safety management tasks and BIM data, to provide a rich semantic database to support FM systems.

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value. In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized. Relying on empirical findings derived from nine projects that examined the efficiency gains and advantages of using a digital systems information model from an engineering to asset management perspective, we construct a generic BDN to visualize the structure of multiple cause-effect relationships that are used to organise the capabilities, changes and benefits that need to be considered prior to adoption.

The greater is the use of ""intelligent assistants"", the more important will be the decisions that people will make between each other. Organization of continuous training of employees in effective communication is today an increasingly popular innovational strategy in companies. How do we remove communication barriers between employees, between teams, and between man and machine? This paper proposes a solution to the posed problem of ensuring the most effective communication using methods developed in physics of the mind and Dynamic Logic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064878359

It involves creating as-is BIM from point clouds obtained from laser scanning. In this article we present our workflow for the generation of information model from 3D point clouds of concrete tetrapod blocks on navigable structure C-1. Point cloud processing method for making informational model for long term monitoring is described. As a result of the research BIM model with each tetrapod was created for deformational monitoring in the comparison with next year model. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058433599

During the construction stage, shop drawings frequently have to be revised because of cognitive differences between the designers and constructors. These two groups of people view the resolution of such clashes from their own perspectives because of differences in their inherent knowledge and experience. To effectively improve the project delivery time, one option is to reduce the number of model revisions during the construction stage. This could be done by providing a BIM model as a reference. In this model, design clashes can be resolved from the perspective of the constructor before discussions in design coordination meetings to find compromises. In this work, an artificial intelligence system for such design clash resolution was developed with machine learning and heuristic optimizing techniques. In the experiment, we present a real case of a student residence, in which the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in the basement are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076088449

Results of comparison of suitable software on the base of a test point cloud are presented. For comparison we had chosen a criterion for how results of point cloud processing can be used in the smart city application. The following software were chosen for comparison: Erdas IMAGINE, ENVI Lidar, TerraSolid (without Terraslave), GlobalMapper, Autodesk InfraWorks. Comparison have been conducted in qualitative and quantitative terms. The results presented allowed us to create recommendations on the usage of specific software for airborne laser scanning data processing for Smart City projects. © Authors 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074638723
