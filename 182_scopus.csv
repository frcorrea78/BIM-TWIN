DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry.

Total life cycle energy use in a building consists of two components: embodied and operational energy. Embodied energy is expended in the processes of building material production, on-site delivery, construction, maintenance, renovation and final demolition. Operational energy is consumed in operating the buildings. Studies have revealed the growing significance of embodied energy inherent in buildings and have demonstrated its relationship to carbon emissions. Current interpretations of embodied energy are quite unclear and vary greatly, and embodied energy databases suffer from the problems of variation and incomparability. Parameters differ and cause significant variation in reported embodied energy figures. Studies either followed the international Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards or did not mention compliance with any standard. Literature states that the current LCA standards fail to provide complete guidance and do not address some important issues. It also recommends developing a set of standards to streamline the embodied energy calculation process. This paper discusses parameters causing problems in embodied energy data and identifies unresolved issues in current LCA standards. We also recommend an approach to derive guidelines that could be developed into a globally accepted protocol. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860213947

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used tool to quantify the environmental impacts of the building sector. The literature recognizes the need to simplify the method application, especially to reduce and optimize data acquisition. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is defined as a virtual 3D building model which integrates with a database of their building elements. Several studies recognize that the integration of BIM and LCA can simplify data acquisition of the building as well as provide both tools with feedback. This paper reviews recent studies centered on BIM-based LCA, and also carries out a methodological analysis of their integration, focusing on the way that BIM can contribute to simplifying data input, and optimize output data and results during the LCA application in buildings. The results show the viability to develop methods based on BIM models for organizing building information used to estimate environmental and energy consumption impacts based on LCA, including: templates and plug-ins for BIM software, and the integration of automated processes combining different data and software. Reviewed papers are simplified LCA applications, mostly focused on CO2 emission calculation during the early stages of design.

However, the study of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4% of the total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction stage accounted for 12.6% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately 2% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage. Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings. However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use phase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because most of this energy comes from fossil fuels, it also contributes greatly to annual carbon emissions. When constructing a building, embodied energy is consumed through construction materials, building products, and construction processes along with any transportation, administration, and management involved. Operating energy is used in space conditioning, heating, lighting, and powering building appliances. In order to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, a comprehensive reduction in both embodied and operating energy is needed. Studies so far have focused on reducing either embodied or operating energy in isolation without realizing the trade-off that exists between them. Also, building energy research has concentrated more on operating energy than embodied energy, and as a result, the operating energy of buildings is gradually decreasing. Due to a variety of issues, however, few efforts have been undertaken to comprehensively minimize embodied energy. Quantifying embodied energy is more tedious, complex, and resource-consuming than measuring operating energy. Furthermore, the reported values of embodied energy vary significantly within and across geographic regions owing to certain methodological and data quality parameters. The literature has repeatedly pointed out a need to standardize these parameters to bring consistency to embodied energy calculations. This paper presents a rigorous review of literature in order to investigate these parameters and their impact on embodied energy calculations. The reported values of initial and life-cycle embodied energy are also presented to highlight variations due to differing parameters. Finally, we suggest a two-step solution to make the process of embodied energy analysis more streamlined and transparent through a set of guidelines and an uncertainty calculation model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019590795

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels.

To support decision making in the early design stage, we propose an approach using Building Information Modeling (BIM) to assess a wide range of construction options and their embodied environmental impact. We use a conceptual BIM model to evaluate a variety of material compositions for different building elements and the potential contribution of elements to the total embodied impact of the building design.

While Building Information Modeling (BIM) gives opportunities to incorporate sustainability performance indicators in the building design process, it lacks interoperability with the conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools used to analyse the environmental footprints of materials in building design. Additionally, many LCA tools use databases based on industry-average values and thus cannot account for differences in the embodied impacts of specific materials from individual suppliers. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports design decisions and enables assessment of the embodied energy associated with building materials supply chain based on suppliers’ Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). The framework also integrates Extract Transform Load (ETL) technology into the BIM to ensure BIM-LCA interoperability, enabling an automated or semi-automated assessment process.

In this regard, the use of building information modelling (BIM) tools has arisen as a new trend in the construction industry to improve the sustainable assessments of buildings in the design phase. For that purpose, current approaches either focus on the use of BIM together with several programs, or solely use it for an automatic quantity take-off. However, as noted in the literature, the lack of semantic information within BIM models can lead to ineffective decision-making processes and models that are unsuitable for the operation and maintenance stages. Therefore, the present study explores the potential of BIM as a repository for the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) information, and how that information should be used for an environmental and economic analysis. By doing so, the authors intend to discuss the potential of BIM as a data repository and its capacity for supporting an automatic/semi-automatic environmental and economic assessment. A BIM-LCA/LCC framework was proposed, which led to the development of an information delivery manual and a model view definition (IDM/MVD), using the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, for the integration and exchange of information within a BIM-based environment. Finally, the authors implemented the proposed framework with a case study. It is observed that, although most recent IFC schemes already consider some of the required information, a considerable number of properties are still required to conduct a comprehensive LCA and LCC analysis. Thus, the work presented here contributes to the existing background knowledge necessary for future implementations of BIM-based LCA/LCC and for software developers to develop a suitable BIM-LCA/LCC tool. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062972950

Still, there are considerable variations in how the method is currently used, leading to limitations in comparing the results and the conclusions that can be drawn. These variations are due to several factors and LCA modellers must make multiple methodological decisions during an assessment. This has resulted, unsurprisingly, in a variety of approaches, and a wide range of outcomes. Academics have produced numerous case studies on particular buildings, aiming towards a detailed understanding of the energy and carbon impacts. However, very few case studies are detailed enough to allow for an in-depth comparison. This article investigates in detail these embodied carbon assessments, considering the data used and the methodological assumptions made. An in-depth analysis shows that there are still considerable variations in how the methodology is applied, leading to substantial limitations in comparing results and drawing conclusions. Results may differ by two orders of magnitude, thus limiting the understanding of how real mitigation might best be achieved.

The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043597534

Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition, collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However, previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could contribute to as high as 45% of carbon emission reduction despite only accounting for 0.66% of the total weight. Across various lifecycle stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of carbon emissions.

However, it is complex to apply in the design phase. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can help to perform LCA during the design process. Current BIM-LCA approaches follow two trends. Either they use complex models in detailed design phases, when it is late for major changes, or they are based on simplified approaches only applicable in early design stages. This paper proposes a novel method for applying LCA continuously over the entire building design process to assess the embodied environmental impacts by using the data provided by BIM with as much accuracy as possible in each stage. The method uses different LCA databases with different levels of detail for the specific level of development (LOD) of the BIM. Since different building elements are not modelled with identical LODs in each design phase, the assessment of embodied environmental impacts is conducted by consistently mixing the LCA databases, which is possible as long as the databases use identical background data. The method is applied to five design stages of a building case study. The results show that it is now possible to calculate the embodied impacts in all design stages while being consistent with the results from the completed project. The environmental impact in a certain design phase is always within the range of variability of the previous phase. Therefore, the method allows to estimate the final embodied environmental impact with increasing accuracy and by that provide information for decision-making throughout the whole design process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059301627

If steel is produced from electric arc furnace with 100% recycled steel scrap as the feedstock, the embodied carbon of the building can be reduced by over 60%. As for ready-mixed concrete, 10–20% embodied carbon reduction in buildings can be achieved by utilizing cement substitutes (35% fly ash or 75% slag). However, using concrete with large amounts of cement substitutes has longer setting periods and affects the construction time. In projects with strict construction schedules, contractors may use less cement substitutes, leading to increased embodied carbon emissions in buildings. When large amounts of recycled steel and cement substitutes are used in construction, the carbon emissions from transportation can increase up to 20% of the embodied carbon in a building. In such cases, a trade-off analysis considering both the embodied carbon and the material availability is needed in order to determine the optimal source locations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994644543

One such solution is the use of a recent technology such as building information modelling (BIM). Accordingly, the present article reviews the current state of literature on sustainable construction and BIM, including the latter's evolution. In contrast to previous reviews on this subject, the present work has a broader scope that covers the environmental, economic, and social dimensions and their combinations. To obtain a comprehensive review, the authors conducted an informetric analysis of the literature and categorised it based on a content analysis. A total of 11 different terms and 28 combinations were used to collect relevant literature on this subject, resulting in a total of 317 journal articles for the period between 2008 and 2017. The information obtained from informetric analysis was later validated by a content analysis, in which gaps and trends were identified. It was observed that publications on this subject registered an exponential growth, with 90% of the articles being published in the last five years. The authors identified a gap in literature pertaining to the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability; however, literature on the integration of sustainable performance and BIM has grown considerably in recent years, which indicates that BIM is increasingly being used as a reliable method for sustainable construction practices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063401834

Often researchers should acquire data through typical process technology (national average level), engineering estimation and the professional judgments. There is a need to further study on embodied energy and carbon emissions of building, in this study, an embodied energy consumption and carbon emissions of the residential buildings model was created to study three steel-construction residential buildings in China. This model includes the materials production phase, transportation phase, construction phase, recycle and demolition phase as well as upstream of energy. The direct materials and energy consumption of these three residential buildings with different volumes are investigated on site. The results show that the embodied energy consumption of steel members, concrete and cement account for more than 60% of the total energy consumption of all building components, the proportion of energy consumption of steel members increases with the increasing of the floors, while the proportion of energy consumption of concrete and cement decreases, the embodied energy and environment issues of the building components of the steel-construction buildings is sensitive to building height rather than building volumes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A narrative literature review was carried out to provide a comprehensive overview as well as to highlight the recent contributions related to the environmental evaluation of high-rise and low-rise buildings. The study was carried out by searching the databases of the Scopus and Elsevier in conjunction with ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases. The reason for this was to cover the published papers in this field up to the highest degree of accuracy. By means of the search of publications quoting the use of LCA in construction sector for the period from 1997 to 2018, more than 230 peer-reviewed publications referencing the use of life cycle assessment in buildings have been identified. The review shows that low-rise buildings (1~5 floors) compared to high-rise ones (≥ 5 floors) received significant attention as the studies focusing on the life cycle assessment of low-rise buildings were about twice in number more than the studies related to the life cycle assessment of high-rise buildings. In case of high-rise buildings, commercial buildings gained more attention by over 60% of the reviewed studies, while for low-rise buildings, residential buildings took the leverage by accounting to over 70% of the reviewed studies. The more frequently studied life cycle stages were those related to the manufacturing and use phases. Similarly, the most considered impact categories were the global warming potential and embodied energy. The reported values for embodied energy of high-rise buildings had a great variation ranging from 0.533 MJ/m2 to 883.1 GJ/m2, while the same values for low-rise buildings ranged from 0.21 to 374.4 GJ/m2. In terms of global warming potential, high-rise buildings emitted 10 to 10,010 kg CO2-eq/m2 per year, however, some studies revealed the potential of timber structure in emission reduction by values ranging from 234.8 to 1338 kg CO2-eq/m2. The emissions associated by low-rise buildings ranged from 0.07 to 35,765 kg CO2-eq/m2, and the respective values for emission reduction by timber structures were between 12.9 and 361 kg CO2-eq/m2. The results also indicate that a wide range of building's lifespan varying from 20 to over 100 years were utilized in life cycle assessment of different types of buildings. Functional unit was also another parameter that showed a broad variation both in terms of unit and definition. While the majority of researchers considered “m2” as the functional unit (61%), “whole building” was also considered as the functional unit in almost 20% of the reviewed studies, indicating the lack of standardized definition for functional unit for more practical outcomes. Ecoinvent was the most referred inventory database (65%) for life cycle assessment of buildings followed by University of Bath ICE (11%), U.S. database (9%), and Australian material inventory database (7%). SimaPro dominated computer-aided softwares with 40% of citations among the reviewed studies. ATHENA Impact Estimator and GaBi software gathered the attention of the reviewed studies by 7.5% and 4%, respectively.

Among the available embodied energy calculation methods, an input-output-based hybrid (IOH) method has the potential to offer a more complete calculation. However, its calculation lacks specificity and reliability, which can be improved using suggestions provided by literature. Studies across the globe have proposed techniques such as sectoral disaggregation to enhance not only the specificity and reliability, but also the completeness, of an IOH method. This study investigated and improved an IOH method of embodied energy calculation. Using the improved method, the embodied energy of commonly used building materials was calculated and evaluated.

The temporal perspectives of emissions were considered, including the potential improvements to energy efficiency and the weighted average impacts for delayed emissions in the operation and disposal phases. A case study of a residential building in a cold region was analyzed, and scenario analyses were conducted. The results indicated that the relative contribution of embodied emissions (10551 tCO2e) considering the temporal perspectives could be twice that of conventional calculations. Further discussion revealed that the payback time of constructing a new building could be 45 years compared to the current regional average buildings. Hence, with respect to the high costs and technical limits of passive houses, renovating old buildings with energy saving measures might be the most appropriate approach for implementing the short-term low-carbon development target.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been increasingly used to assess the environmental impacts of construction products and buildings and a new trend is characterized by the application of LCA to larger systems such as neighborhoods during early design phases. Assessing urban development projects at the master-planning stage raises the issue of inventory data collection, especially for building materials which are reported to account for about 20% of primary energy consumption in buildings, and up to 45% of associated greenhouse gas emissions. Urban planners focus on the urban morphology and little information is known about the buildings characteristics apart from their general shape. This paper proposes a simplified model for the assessment of buildings embodied energy and embodied carbon in relation with urban planners’ design levers. The model relies on the decomposition of buildings into functional elements in order to be sensitive to the shape of the buildings. A detailed sensitivity analysis and contribution analysis of the model is conducted on two types of generic building forms, in order to investigate the influence of parameters relating to shape on the embodied energy and embodied carbon of a building. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameters relating to shape (such as the dimension of the buildings) are more influential on the embodied energy and embodied carbon per square meter of building than the ones relating to the elements themselves (such as the wall thickness).

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, moni-toring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling sys-tems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors. © 2021 by the author.

Although there exist some studies on embodied carbon, they are analyzed based on the project level or case studies, and few studies explore the embodied carbon dioxide in the building sector. To achieve the peaking of China's carbon emission by 2030, a process-based approach and a disaggregated input-output model in this study were adopted to estimate the annual embodied carbon dioxide from the China's building sector, respectively. The results of embodied carbon dioxide emissions were 1421.70 Mt and 1599.62 Mt in the building sector in 2015, respectively. In terms of building types, the embodied carbon dioxide in the residential building sector is about 1.5–2.2 times that of the non-residential building sector. In addition, it is indicated that, unlike the small magnitude of embodied carbon compared with operational carbon in life cycle of buildings, the annual embodied carbon dioxide accounts for roughly one-half in the total carbon dioxide emissions in the building sector in 2015.

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies. © 2021 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103484819

In addition, with the ongoing efforts focusing on reducing the operational energy consumption of buildings, the embodied emissions of buildings are expected to increase in proportion in the future. With the increasing focus placed on the embodied emissions of buildings, organizations in the construction industry will face requirements to report information regarding the embodied emissions of buildings. However, in order to obtain the embodied emission of buildings, tremendous efforts have to be placed as the process is data intensive. In order to overcome this challenge, a streamlined technique is proposed to minimize the efforts required by practitioner to obtain the embodied carbon footprint. The proposed technique comprises a probabilistic model of emission factor estimators used to estimate the required embodied emissions. Based on the four projects presented as case study for the proposed technique, the practitioner would be required to manually match the appropriate emission factors to the activity data for between 12 and 21% of the data points. This is in contrast to the current traditional technique, which requires the manual matching of 100% of data points.

Therefore utilizations of overseas LCI with valid modification have become an effective way to expand the usage of existing LCI as well as to quickly establish a localized inventory.

Reducing the whole-life impacts of buildings is critical for creating a net-zero carbon built environment. For this to be achieved, the whole-life carbon impacts of design decisions must be considered during the building design process. A systematic review of academic literature was conducted to assess how life cycle assessment (LCA) is incorporated at various stages of the building design process, and what improvements are needed to support net-zero carbon design. The review compiled 274 papers that were published up to the end of 2019, of which 108 were subject to detailed review following screening. The review found that LCA is generally used late in the design process, when it is too late to greatly influence the design. Incorporating LCA with either building information modelling or life cycle costing is seen to have the same challenges as undertaking a traditional LCA. Parametric methods show promise for design development, but tools and algorithms require further verification and regionalisation to be implemented throughout industry. The use of benchmarks, target values and other pre-populated information can be used to incorporate life-cycle thinking without the need to undertake a detailed LCA.

As recent studies have analyzed the current level of adoption of DT technologies in the manufacturing sector, less effort has been focused on evaluating applications in the safety domain. Theoretically, the DT inherent capability of acquiring data from the physical world - usually developed in real time – together with the potentiality of reliable data processing could support a more effective diffusion of dynamic risk assessment models as well as real time alert management systems for improving safety.

However, information contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the development of a building DT. © 2020 by the authors.

Various methods have been proposed for the emission assessment, yet it is still difficult for building designers and engineers to implement the calculation in the design and construction stage owing to the complexity in data analysis. In this context, the present study proposed a subproject-based approach, and develop the building emission quota accordingly. Compared with conventional process-based analysis, the necessity and organization of the emission quota were underlined from the perspectives of scopes, inventory, and data structure. Based on the proposed quota, a calculator was developed and a case study was made on a residential building to examine the reliability and efficiency of the approach. The results indicated that, embodied emissions according to the proposed quota were consistent with the conventional analysis within the same system boundary. Furthermore, the application scopes and relevant advantages of adopting the emission quota were discussed. Overall, this study can promote the efficiency and reduce the difficulty in building emission assessment, and therefore be useful to low-carbon design and construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090410835

One of the major causes is the limited understanding of production processes formalized from a shared unit among construction project participants. To improve the understanding, the definition of a construction part was formulated for a fundamental unit of building input products as a common denominator. To focus on the value added by construction crews and to allow cross-project comparisons, this definition was formulated to be consistent, value-focused, and quantifiable. This paper discusses the consistency and quantifiability of the definition and decomposition method for construction parts, as illustrated through a case study.

Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses a three-step (bottom-up) process-based life cycle analysis of the construction material set for two different apartment units. The current study uses material analysis. Embodied CO2 is estimated by multiplying material masses with the corresponding ECO2 coefficients (kg CO2/kg). Due to the lack of a comprehensive Kosovo database, data from an international database are utilized. The results provide practical baseline indicators for the contribution of each material in terms of mass and embodied CO2. Findings: Results of quantitative research find that apartment unit representative of the old communist-era construction produces 50 percent more embodied CO2 emissions than an apartment unit that is representative of modern construction in Kosovo. The study finds that this difference comes mainly because of the utilization of larger quantities of steel, concrete, and precast fabricated concrete in the apartment unit that is representative of the old communist era. Research limitations/implications: The calculation of embodied CO2 emissions for major construction materials in typical apartments in Kosovo can help in the development of national databases in the future. The availability of such databases could help the construction industry in Kosovo to open up to new sustainable design approaches since such databases and evaluations performed in the national context in Kosovo could help the builders in selecting, assessing and using environmentally friendly materials during the design or refurbishment stage of a building. Originality/value: This paper is the first investigation of the embodied carbon emission in two different typical apartment building structures in Kosovo. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073992153

A bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range of research from model-based information management to building information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings and smart cities. The ‘virtual-physical building integration’, ‘building lifecycle management’, and ‘information integrated production’ subjects are highly in the focus of the research field. While ‘information-based predictive management’ and ‘virtual-based information utilization’ studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge.

Construction is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions in the construction stage are mainly from the construction materials and the construction activities. The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively calculate the carbon dioxide emissions in the construction process, and provide a method of controlling the CO2 emissions effectively by converting into cost. In this study, the authors selected the tunnel construction as the research object, and chose the primary greenhouse gas-CO2 to estimate emissions. The authors did a research based on BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology, to calculate CO2 emission during the construction process. It considered the CO2 emissions from main materials and equipment. Finally, the authors used the recent carbon emission trading price to convert the CO2 emission into cost, and did the economic analysis. The method proposed in this paper can effectively evaluate the CO2 emissions in the construction process; it has a good reference significance for the selection of low-carbon emission materials in the design process, and it provides a case reference and direction for research of low-carbon equipment. By using the EU emissions trading system, the economic conversion of CO2 emissions will provide an economic evaluation index for the CO2 emissions of tunnel construction activities. Meanwhile, based on the method of this study, a BIM-based automated performance evaluation system could be developed. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089812902

Even if there has been a great deal of efforts toward digital twin engineering, little attention has been paid to the correct integration of humans in the emerging context of smart factories and, in particular, to the potential contribution of digital twins for supporting a health and safety 4.0 at the workplace. This paper sets the stage for a discussion over health and safety aspects for the Smart Operator and proposes a renewed approach to the theme in the context of industry 4.0, aimed at exploiting the value of digital information in improving the wellness and safety conditions of workers. A digital twin reference model has been developed that illustrates how to extract and analyze real-time safety information, to detect potential hazardous situations and to send out alerts to the smart operators that are using Augmented Reality devices, such as smartphones or tablets, at the workplace.
