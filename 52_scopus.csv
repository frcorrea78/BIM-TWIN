This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing.

These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the ""as-is"" conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large, highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873283130

To facilitate existing-structure data acquisition for the as-built BIM, a terrestrial laser scanner, which is fast, simple to use, and yet highly accurate, is widely employed. However, as-built BIM creation of building interiors using scanned point clouds incurs critical difficulties: the complex design of indoor structures, not to mention obstacles, necessitates time-consuming manual operation and resultantly huge data sizes, which often leads to system slow-down or failure. To manage this problem, most of the recent and current research has looked to full automation; yet facility management personnel still rely on traditional field measurements because their qualitative results can only be obtained under ideal conditions or with some errors. Alternatively, in this paper, a more practical semi-automatic methodology for improved productivity of as-built BIM creation with respect to large and complex indoor environments is proposed. The proposed approach produces three-dimensional (3D) geometric drawings through three steps: segmentation for plane extraction, refinement for removal of noisy points, and boundary tracing for outline extraction. The experimental results for two test sites, a relatively simple corridor and a complex atrium, showed a high data-size reduction rate: to 3.8 and 4.3% of the original sizes, out of 51.5 and 111.5 million points, respectively. Based on the automatically produced geometric drawings and the remaining points, manual as-built BIM creation was conducted. Using the extracted lines as guides, each object and its relationship were more easily identified and modeled. At the same time, the great reduction in the point clouds' data sizes enabled the modeler, using the BIM software, to efficiently manipulate the geometric drawing without system slow-down or failure. The proposed approach was shown to be a potentially effective means of improving productivity and reliability in complex indoor as-built BIM production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896541031

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows.

Contrary to outdoor environments, first responders and planners have limited information regarding the indoor areas in terms of architectural and semantic information as well as how they interact with their surroundings in case of indoor disasters. Availability of such information could help decision makers interact with building information and thus make more efficient planning prior to entering the disaster site. In addition as the indoor travel times required to reach specific areas in the building could be much longer compared to outdoor, visualizing the exact location of building rooms and utilities in 3D helps in visually communicating the indoor spatial information which could eventually result in decreased routing uncertainty inside the structures and help in more informed navigation strategies. This work aims at overcoming the insufficiencies of existing indoor modelling approaches by proposing a new Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) based on IFC.

However, generation of such models currently is mostly performed manually, and errors can be introduced during data collection, pre-processing, and modeling. This paper presents a method for assessing the quality of as-is BIMs generated from point cloud data by analyzing the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point cloud data. The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the depiction of the components and their spatial attributes. Major geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate potential errors introduced during data collection, processing and/or model generation. The research described in this paper provides a taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source, magnitude, and nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns. The method is validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical measurement method in a case study. The results show that the deviation analysis method is capable of identifying almost six times more errors with more than 40% time savings compared to the physical measurement method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884502984

In today's BIM-based energy modeling practice, thermal properties are mainly derived from generic building construction types in BIM. However, for energy modeling of existing buildings, such assumptions are often inaccurate as they do not account for diminishing thermal resistances of building materials instigated by their deteriorations. To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes. By associating these measurements with their corresponding elements in gbXML, thermal properties of the BIM elements are automatically updated. Our experiments in real-world residential and instructional buildings show how actual thermal properties can be automatically associated with BIM elements and updated in gbXML.

Field experience shows that energy savings of 5-30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900427828

The combination of BIM with automation systems improves the quality control during diagnosis, design and work execution, and the labour savings, which is particularly relevant for rapid intervention in case of hazardous conditions. Therefore, the paper is going to address a methodological discussion concerning complete “as-built” parametric models of historical buildings, supporting the design of refurbishment and conservation interventions. Although some reviews of the state of the art exist on the topic of Historic Building Information Modelling, the present research introduces a different perspective on HBIM modelling, with diagnosis and performance assessment as key-aspects, in terms of automating performance assessment. Specifically, from the data collection of contributions regarding HBIM/BIM, diagnostics and monitoring on existing buildings and infrastructures, a critical review by selected criteria is developed. Nevertheless, general methods and tools for information management and exchange tasks in BIM are briefly described as well, since they are considered useful for future developments of HBIM approach. The core of the critical analysis is focused on the scientific and technical relations among HBIM models, diagnosis and performance assessment features. In addition, the review identifies specific activities and relative tools and methods for knowledge acquisition and semantic enrichment. Finally, gaps in knowledge of the current literature are outlined and discussed, with specific focus on performance assessment in HBIM. In this regard, a new methodology toward Diagnosis-Aided Historic Building Information Modelling and Management (DA-HBIMM) is proposed as a framework to be developed in order to address smart knowledge acquisition, collection and notification of assessed performances and eventual risks, by cognitive automation and artificial intelligence, in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037354812

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-vs-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-vs-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-vs-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902439119

If these models are generated from laser scanning point clouds automatically textured with thermographic and RGB images, their capacities are exponentially increased, since also their visualization and not only the consultation of their data increases the information available from the building. Since laser scanning, infrared thermography and photography are techniques that acquire information of the object as-is, the resulting BIM includes information on the real condition of the building in the moment of inspection, consequently helping to a more efficient planning of the rehabilitation works, enabling the repair of the most severe faults.

Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings.

Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals.

Two new developments for as-built BIM modelling are presented in this article. The first is a new library of reusable parametric objects designed for modelling classical architectural elements from survey data. These library objects are dynamic and have parameters that can instantly alter the shape, size and other properties of objects. The parametric architectural objects have been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded programming language within the ArchiCAD BIM software called Geometric Description Language (GDL). The second development which is described in more detail in this article is a complete parametric building façade. This parametric building facade can be used as a template for fast and efficient generation of BIM facade geometry. The design of this parametric façade incorporates concepts from procedural modelling which is an automated approach to generating 3D geometries based on rules and algorithms. Parametric architectural objects are automatically combined with rules to generate many different façade arrangements which are controlled by user parameters. When automatically generating a façade, the initial position and size of elements are estimated using classical architectural proportions. Object can then be graphically edited individually or in groups to match the computer generated geometry to survey data. The parametric façade template has also been implemented with the Geometric Description Language for ArchiCAD BIM software. This enables the tools developed to utilise the full benefits of BIM software which includes automated construction or conservation documents, semantic object oriented objects based on IFC semantic classes, automatic lists of objects and material and the ability to add and link additional information to the model. Initial user tests have indicated that the parametric façade is more efficient than previous methods for creating accurate façade models from survey data. The façade template also provides an easier solution for generating façade models when compared to existing methods. Non-specialist users with little experience in 3D modelling can easily generate and modify the façade template by altering parameters graphically or from a dialogue box. © 2014 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894458566

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s. This is a huge leap over the current practice of digital twinning performed manually. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065641838

This paper proposes and demonstrates a robust technique that uses the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema to automatically update an as-designed BIM based on site observations for inspected building elements. It receives as input an inspected object's actual type and inspection details including the detected defects/changes, responsible actors, as-built/as-is type, captured images, and time and the date of the inspection. The algorithm automatically analyzes the IFC data model to retrieve the element's semantics and identifies discrepancies between the as-built/as-is and as-designed object conditions. Based on the results of the discrepancy analysis, the IFC data model is populated with new semantics, resulting in the update of object types, properties, and three-dimensional (3D) shape representations.

Acquisition of sensor data of a building is essential to ensure the improvement of the indoor thermal environment for the occupants. The environmental sensor technologies together with Building Information Modeling (BIM) are tools for assessing/analyzing the performance of a building. Although BIM has a potential to verify thermal performance by using a BIM database, integrating the surface-heat of building envelopes and sensing data has not been fully explored in the existing BIM. BIM requires tools to enable building professionals to effectively detect the location of thermal defects and analyze the thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort by accommodating environmental information to be used in the analysis process. Therefore, this research presents a novel method for integrating time-stamped 3D thermal data in the BIM. In the proposed method, the BIM model is integrated with spatio-temporal thermal and air temperature data. Visual scripting is used for extracting and then mapping spatio-temporal thermal data to a 3D BIM model. The proposed system converts the collected thermal images into numeric surface temperatures, integrates collected environmental data in the BIM, calculates thermal comfort variables, such as mean radiant temperature (MRT), and assesses the thermal comfort level for various locations inside the building.

Automating the PCD conversion process can drastically reduce the cost of generating as-built BIMs. Due to the widespread existence of planar structures in civil infrastructures, detecting and extracting planar patches from raw PCDs is a fundamental step in the conversion pipeline from PCDs to BIMs. However, existing methods cannot effectively address both automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from infrastructure PCDs. The existing methods cannot resolve the problem due to the large scale and model complexity of civil infrastructure, or due to the requirements of extra constraints or known information. To address the problem, this article presents a novel framework for automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from large-scale and noisy raw PCDs. The proposed method automatically detects planar structures, estimates the parametric plane models, and determines the boundaries of the planar patches. The first step recovers existing linear dependence relationships amongst points in the PCD by solving a group-sparsity inducing optimization problem. Next, a spectral clustering procedure based on the recovered linear dependence relationships segments the PCD. Then, for each segmented group, model parameters of the extracted planes are estimated via singular value decomposition (SVD) and maximum likelihood estimation sample consensus (MLESAC). Finally, the α-shape algorithm detects the boundaries of planar structures based on a projection of the data to the planar model. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively by experiments on two types of PCDs from real-world infrastructures, one captured directly by laser scanners and the other reconstructed from video using structure-from-motion techniques. To evaluate the performance comprehensively, five evaluation metrics are proposed which measure different aspects of performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, in the sense that the method automatically and accurately extracts planar patches from large-scaled raw PCDs without any extra constraints nor user assistance. © 2014 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920928237

However, until now, the potential of these systems has been demonstrated for tracking progress of permanent structural works only; no work has been reported yet on tracking secondary or temporary structures. For structural concrete work, temporary structures include formwork, scaffolding and shoring, while secondary components include rebar. Together, they constitute most of the earned value in concrete work. The impact of tracking secondary and temporary objects would thus be added veracity and detail to earned value calculations, and subsequently better project control and performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues.

Both techniques represent significant innovative extensions of existing ""Scan-vs-BIM"" object recognition frameworks. Findings - The experimental results show that it is feasible to recognise secondary and temporary objects in TLS point clouds with good accuracy using the two novel techniques; but it is envisaged that superior results could be achieved by using additional cues such as colour and 3D edge information.

Building Information Models and as-built scanned data can be used in Scan-vs-BIM processes to effectively and comprehensively support these activities. This however requires accurate registration of scanned point clouds with 3D (BIM) models. Automating such registration remains a challenge in the context of the built environment, because as-built can be incomplete and/or contain data from non-model objects, and construction buildings and other structures often present symmetries and self-similarities that are very challenging to registration. In this paper, we present a novel automatic coarse registration method that is an adaptation of the ‘4 Points Congruent Set’ algorithm to the use of planes; we call it the ‘4-Plane Congruent Set’ (4-PlCS) algorithm. The approach is further integrated in a software system that delivers not one but a ranked list of the most likely transformations, so to allow the user to quickly select the correct transformation, if need be. Two variants of the method are also considered, in particular one in the case when the vertical axis is known a priori; we call that method the 4.5-PlCS method. The proposed algorithm is tested using five different datasets, including three simulated and two real-life ones. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where the correct transformation always ranks very high (in our experiments, first or second), and is extremely close to the ground-truth transformation. Experimental comparison of the proposed approach with a standard, more intuitive approach based on finding 3-plane congruent sets shows the discriminatory power of 4-plane bases over 3-plane bases, albeit at no clear benefits in terms of computational time.

A slurry shield machine with a cutter diameter of 15.76 m was designed to be hoisted for 44 m into the underground tunnel shafts. The major challenges of this hoisting were as follows: 1) complex construction environment for hoisting, 2) limited visibility of crane operator or blind hoisting, and 3) precise control of position and gesture of a giant cutter wheel in real time. To overcome these challenges, the CPS-SMS was proposed to simulate and monitor the hoisting process to avoid the unsafe status of cranes and the hoisted cutter wheel.

The implementation of monitoring blind hoist in the Yangtze River, which crosses the metro tunnel construction site, was successful, that is, no collision or injury occurred. The CPS-SMS can be applied by practitioners to various construction projects, such as dams, high-rise buildings, and large-scale infrastructure projects, to decrease the likelihood of safety risks in blind hoisting in complex environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056508559

Currently these as-built models are created manually, which is time-consuming. An important step in the automated Scan-to-BIM procedure is the interpretation and classification of point cloud data. This is computationally challenging due to the sheer size of point cloud data for an entire building. Additionally, the variety of objects makes classification problematic. Existing methods integrate prior knowledge from the sensors or environment to improve the results. However, these approaches are therefore often case specific and thus have limited applicability. The goal of this research is to provide a method that is independent of any sensor or scene within a building environment. Furthermore, our method processes the entire building simultaneously, resulting in more distinct local and contextual features. This paper presents a generic approach to automatically identify structural elements for the purposes of Scan-to-BIM. More specifically, a Random Forests classifier is employed for the classification of the floors, ceilings, roofs, walls and beams. As input, our algorithm takes a set of planar primitives that are pre-segmented from the point cloud. This significantly reduces the data while maintaining accuracy. Both contextual and geometric features are used to describe the observed patches. The algorithm is evaluated using realistic data for a wide variety of existing buildings including houses, school facilities, a factory, a castle and a church. The experiments prove that the proposed algorithm is capable of properly labeling 87% of the structural elements with an average precision of 85% in highly cluttered environments without the support of the sensors position. In future work, the classified patches will be processed by class-specific reconstruction algorithms to create BIM geometry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046700582

This paper proposes a new shape grammar approach for efficient generation of 3D models of indoor environments from point clouds. The shape grammar derives 3D models of complex environments by using a simple primitive and iterative application of grammar rules governed by a production procedure. The method can reconstruct both building elements and navigable spaces along with their topological relations. It produces 3D parametric models with high geometric accuracy and rich semantic content compliant with building information modeling (BIM) standards. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets show the ability of the method to generate highly accurate indoor models with computation times ranging from seconds to a few minutes.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is developed and tested in a case study. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071686342

At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And, modifications and deviations of the original building structure, equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete, obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning. To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings, buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment. Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building information as it occurs in existing buildings. We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with software modules for building information acquisition, 3D reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally. For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements. From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction information is used for optimized project planning with a solution algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) at hand. In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities. Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification, onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options. Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and will further improve the systems’ quality, effectiveness and accuracy. Future research and application areas are seen in the quantification and analysis of the effects of missing data, the integration of material classification and sampling sensors into the system, the system connection to Building Information Modelling (BIM) software via a respective interface and the transfer and extension to retrofit project planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044162615

This paper focuses on the challenges connected to the operation phase of buildings, when the adoption of BIM can make information retrieval and management easier and more efficient. More specifically, a BIM-based cyber-physical system for the automated monitoring of buildings during their regular operation is proposed and tested by means of a customised simulator. The system automatically works out key performance indicators based on the overall throughput effectiveness (OTE) metric, assessing both the overall efficiency and the efficiency of every sub-system integrated in the building. Thus, assessments of the contribution of every sub-system to the operation of the building are performed in real-time. In addition, the metric proposed can help manage multi-objective real-time control. The system is self-reconfigurable thanks to the self-similarity assumption of the computational structure that is designed as a holarchy of holonic systems.

However, existing approaches to decision-making on equipment maintenance have not considered such features. To fill this gap, this research aims to propose a data-driven approach for decision-making on equipment maintenance by integrating three technologies: Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS). By implementing quantitative decision-making models and Monte-Carlo simulation, a data-driven RCM process is proposed.

As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element.

To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components.

However, the geometric modeling can be time-consuming and expensive, especially as a tunnel does not have an as-designed BIM. To meet this demand, this article develops a general technique to automatically identify the different types of components (rails, cross-sections, pipes, catenary equipment and refuges) and create parametric as-is BIMs for single-track railway tunnels using the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data. This technique includes two core operations: point cloud classification and model parameters estimation. Several classification algorithms are developed to find the point group belonging to each tunnel component based on the geometric features of points, such as relative distance, relative angle, convex hull and linearity. Based on these point groups, the model parameters of each component are estimated to create the final as-is BIM product. The experiment on two operating single-track railway tunnels was conducted and demonstrated that the proposed technique can automatically create as-is BIMs with identified components. The evaluation on the accuracies of models was conducted by analysis of point-to-model distances as well as comparisons with the existing methods and total station surveying, results of which show that the models of rails, linings and refuges achieve millimeter-level accuracy, and that the models of pipes and catenary equipment achieve centimeter-level accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071302997

In this work, we propose a framework to guide practitioners intending to develop advanced predictive building control strategies. The framework provides the means to enhance legacy and modernized buildings regarding energy efficiency by integrating their available instrumentation into a data-driven predictive cyber-physical system. For this, the framework fuses two highly relevant approaches and embeds these into the building context: the generic model-based design methodology for cyber-physical systems and the cross-industry standard process for data mining. A Spanish school's heating system serves to validate the approach. Two different data-driven approaches to prediction and optimization are used to demonstrate the methodological flexibility: (i) a combination of Bayesian regularized neural networks with genetic algorithm based optimization, and (ii) a reinforcement learning based control logic using fitted Q-iteration are both successfully applied. Experiments lasting a total of 43 school days in winter 2015/2016 achieved positive effects on weather-normalized energy consumption and thermal comfort in day-to-day operation. A first experiment targeting comfort levels comparable to the reference period lowered consumption by one-third. Two additional experiments raised average indoor temperatures by 2 K. The better of these two experiments only consumed 5% more energy than the reference period.

This research investigates methods to enable the autonomous sensing and modeling of construction objects so construction robots can ultimately adapt to unexpected circumstances and perform quality work. To that end, two construction component model fitting techniques are presented, namely the Clustering and Iterative Closest Point (CICP) construction component model fitting technique and the Generalized Resolution Correlative Scan Matching (GRCSM) construction component model fitting technique. The GRCSM construction component model fitting technique employs the presented GRCSM search algorithm, which is a modified version of the existing Multi-Resolution Correlative Scan Matching (MRCSM) search algorithm. Three experiments are presented to evaluate the ability of the CICP and GRCSM construction component model fitting techniques to model construction features. It was found that the CICP and GRCSM construction component model fitting techniques are capable of estimating the pose and geometry of arbitrarily shaped objects and construction joints, but are susceptible to modeling error.

It remains challenging, however, to effectively use these technologies to enable the precise and reliable coordination of material flow processes. This paper aims to propose a new workflow designed to include the use of detailed look-ahead plans when using BIM and RFID technologies, which can accurately track and match both the dynamic site needs and supply status of materials. Design/methodology/approach: The new workflow is designed according to lean theory and is modeled using business process modeling notation. To digitally support the workflow, an integrated BIM-RFID database system is constructed that links information on material demands with look-ahead plans. The new workflow is then used to manage material flows in the erection of an office building with prefabricated columns. The performance of the new workflow is compared with that of a traditional workflow, using discrete event simulations. The input for the simulations was derived from expert opinion in semi-structured interviews. Findings: The new workflow enables contractors to better observe on-site status and differences between the actual and planned material requirements, as well as to alert suppliers if necessary. The simulation results indicate that the new workflow has the potential to reduce the duration of the material flow processes by 16.1% compared with the traditional workflow. Research limitations/implications: The new workflow is illustrated using a real-world-like situation with input data based on expert opinion. Although the workflow shows potential, it should be tested on a real-world site. Practical implications: The new workflow allows project participants to combine detailed near-term look-ahead plans with BIM and RFID technologies to better manage material flow processes. It is particularly useful for the management of engineer-to-order components considering the dynamic site progress. Originality/value: The research improves on existing research focused on using BIM and RFID technologies to improve material flow processes by showing how the workflow can be adapted to use detailed look-ahead plans.

Fast and robust indoor localization is of great importance for location-based facility management services, such as the ones used in mobile computing settings. However, there are several challenges in achieving fast and robust indoor localization: 1) Signal-based indoor localization methods, such as WIFI, RFID, Bluetooth and Ultrasound, require installation of extra infrastructures in a building to support localization; 2) Visual-based indoor localization methods, such as LiDAR and camera, depend on feature point detection and matching, which require heavy computation and can also be impacted by environmental conditions, such as lighting and texture richness. In addition to these, existing localization methods do not support semantic understanding which is of great importance when associating a component with its digital twin. To address the stated problems above, this paper presents a vision and learning-based framework that utilizes a shared convolutional neural network to perform localization and semantic segmentation simultaneously. The proposed framework can support facility management by locating facility components within a building and associate them with their digital twins in an information repository. Compared to conventional methods, the developed image-based indoor localization and semantic mapping framework has the following advantages: 1) It only requires image as input to support localization, semantic understanding, and association, which eliminates the need for extra infrastructure, such as deployment of RFID tags, etc.; 2) It reuses the feature extraction network for simultaneous localization and semantic understanding, which saves computing resources; 3) With 6-DoF poses and semantic labels, it supports component-level association. The authors evaluated the proposed framework on publicly available data sets using three metrics: localization accuracy, semantic segmentation accuracy, and association success rate. The results show that the proposed image-based method can achieve 6-DoF localization and semantic segmentation concurrently. Also, formalized experiments on a synthetic data set with different noise levels introduced to localization and semantic segmentation showed that a main factor affecting the performance of association of an image to its digital twin is the accuracy of its localization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070367173

A framework is proposed for multi-roller compaction monitoring, which consists of five modules, i.e. data acquisition module, data transmission module, remote servers, in-situ control module, and monitoring terminal. Algorithms are created to calculate compaction parameters in the scenario of multi-machine operations. A managerial mechanism involving cyber space, human intervention, and compaction machines is set up to achieve collaborative compaction control. Field experiments were conducted to validate the efficacy of the system, of which the results suggest the proposed system can effectively control the compaction process. With inappropriate compaction effort being identified, tracked, and rectified in real time, the compaction quality is ensured. The development of the cyber-physical system paves the way for deploying multiple automatic rollers in the construction site for collaborative and adaptive compaction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056801333

Recent advances in technologies such as building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks, augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense opportunity to radically improve the way daily O&M is conducted. This paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants’ thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach: The developed system focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O&M activities such as inspection, recording, communication and verification. Findings: Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an example, the case study demonstrates that the O&M management process can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system. Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site. Originality/value: The originality lies in bringing together the advances in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to support the daily O&M management activities. In particular, the paper presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for visualising those assets with related information. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087569841

Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) are among the strategies that allow minimising energy use and costs during operation. However, the need for fast and accurate dynamic models (e.g. grey box model), which are time-consuming and challenging to implement, precludes their systematic integration in the built environment. A typical grey-box modelling approach consists of manually implementing several grey-box model structures with an increasing level of complexity before performing a forward selection procedure to identify the optimal configuration. The link between the different grey-box models and the monitored data is also established manually. Such an approach can be both time-consuming and error-prone and involves a significant cost that hampers the broad adoption of strategies such as MPC and FDD. This study proposes a tool-chain that uses BIM to automatically generate several grey-box structures with added complexities stemming from the specific geometry and design of the building. More specifically, an existing rule-based IFC to Modelica interface is extended to automatically create several Modelica-based grey box models that gradually take into account the building's specific information and characteristics. Additional rules are also proposed to automate the connection between the models and the building monitoring system. As a forward selection approach, a multi-objective optimisation using the NSGA-2 algorithm is adopted. The application of the tool-chain on two case studies shows that the integration of BIM to automate the implementation of grey box models, not only reduces the human involvement in the modelling process but can also produce more accurate models. Besides, this study shows that the use of multi-objective optimisation with datasets from two different seasons results in models that are valid for all seasons. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061767531

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods integrated into AHUs can help to ensure that they comply with the intended design, and their efficiency is maintained throughout the entire operational stage of the building. Nonetheless, the implementation and deployment of FDDs at the operational stage require an extensive effort. Especially, FDD approaches that rely on first principle models (model-based FDD) need to be manually implemented, and the information necessary for this process is scattered between several exchange formats and files, thus making it time-consuming, error-prone and subject to modellers’ poor judgment. This study aims at facilitating and partially automating the implementation and deployment of model-based FDD. An automated tool-chain that combines a BIM (Building Information Model)-to-BEPS (Building Energy Performance Simulation) tool with a model-based FDD approach is developed. The contribution of this paper lies in the extension of an existing BIM to Modelica BEPS method with an automated calibration approach and a novel model-based FDD. These three elements are integrated in a framework (implemented using Python) to reduce experts’ involvement in FDD implementation and deployment. The developed model-based FDD combines a parity relation procedure for fault detection and profile identification for fault diagnosis. The latter uses the robust multi-objective optimisation algorithm NSGA-2. An error is detected when the difference between prediction and measured data over a specific time window is superior to a predefined threshold. The origin of the error is subsequently identified by estimating the profile of the different controllable components’ control signal. The developed tool-chain was applied to an actual AHU as well as on several numerical scenarios to identify typical AHU faults such as faulty dampers, valves and sensors. This study shows that the developed model-based FDD approach can identify some of the most common faults in AHUs, but more importantly that BIM can facilitate the deployment of model-based FDD in building systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055325442

For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named ‘WoTAS’ (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based ‘STriDE’ (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed ‘WoTAS’ system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations.

A plethora of approaches have been developed that, however, possess several common weaknesses: (1) heavy reliance on laborious manual or semiautomatic segmentation of raw data [e.g., two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) point clouds]; (2) unsatisfactory results for complex scenes (e.g., furniture or nonstandard indoor settings); and (3) failure to use existing resources for modeling and semantic enrichment. This paper aims to advance a novel, derivative-free optimization (DFO)-based approach that can automatically generate semantically rich as-built BIMs of complex scenes from 3D point clouds. In layman's terms, the proposed approach recognizes candidate BIM components from 3D point clouds, reassembles the components into a BIM, and registers them with semantic information from credible sources. The approach was prototyped in Autodesk Revit and tested on a noisy point cloud of office furniture scanned via a Google Tango smartphone. The results revealed that the semantically rich as-built BIM was automatically and correctly generated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.87 cm in 6.44 s, which outperformed the well-known iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The approach was then scaled up to a large auditorium scene consisting of 293 chairs to generate a satisfactory output BIM with a precision of 81.9% and a recall of 80.5%. The semantic registration approach also proved superior to existing segmentation approaches in that it is segmentation-free and capable of processing complex scenes and reusing known information. In addition to these methodological contributions, this approach, properly scaled up, will open new avenues for creation of building/city information models from inexpensive data sources and support profound value-added applications such as smart building or smart city developments. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058550468

Numerous studies have been conducted over the past few decades to model occupant behaviors stochastically for an improved understanding of their activities for different facility management applications. Despite many research efforts to model dynamic behaviors of building occupants, the understanding of their behaviors by incorporating the contextual information linked to the evolution of the building environment is still not adequately explored. The contextual information linked to locations in dynamic environments changes often over time in terms of position, size, properties and relationships with the environment. This changing building environment affects the occupants’ movements and presence inside the facility which ultimately degrades the process of inferring their accurate activities based on the location context. Henceforth, the evolving building information is required to be mapped with occupant movements for an improved understanding of their changing behaviors.

The significant deliverables from the traditional approach include a three-dimensional (3D) solid model and independent 2D drawings. Significant deliverables achieved using a BrIM approach include an intelligent parametric 3D model and associated 2D drawings, as well as integrated datasets representative of the 'as-is' structure. Based on reported research, the initial effort and time expended on model creation in particular will enable significant future benefits. © 2016 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038376198

The main application for such documentation is to assess current as-built conditions of existing, mostly historical, buildings. The technology can also be used as an integral part of construction progress documentation in new projects. In order to equip students with knowledge on the latest technologies in the industry, laser scanning was introduced to students in a BIM course. Students were given a thorough demonstration on how the equipment functions. After that, several campus buildings' exteriors were scanned. Students had the chance to see the scanning in action. More importantly, the generated point-clouds from the scanner were given to students as part of the final project. Five teams were formed and each team was given a set of floor plans, with minimal details, of an existing campus building. The teams were then asked to take measurements from the point-clouds and model the buildings in Autodesk Revit. The lack of marked elevation drawings did not prevent the teams from modeling the buildings fairly accurately. The point-clouds gave the students a large amount of information that were lacking in the provided documents. Even though the learning curve for navigating such point-clouds was a bit steep, the extracted information helped the students better understand the buildings' envelopes and appreciate the real value of laser scanning technology. © 2016 The author.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991111230

It is important to maintain accurate and up-to-date information stored in a BIM so that it can become a reliable data source throughout the service life of a facility. Laser scanning technology is able to capture accurate geometric data in the form of a point cloud and to depict the existing condition of a building. Hence, point cloud data captured by laser scans can be used as references to update a given BIM. An important step during the update process is to match segments of elements captured by a point cloud to building components modeled in a BIM, so that the discrepancies between the two data sets can be identified. Typically, features depicted within point cloud segments and BIM components are used in the matching process. However, understanding is limited regarding which features enable the matching process and how these features perform. This paper describes six feature-based matching approaches that match segments of a point cloud to components modeled in a BIM. Next, it discusses the results of an experimental analysis conducted to evaluate the performance of different features used to match mechanical equipment and ductwork captured by point clouds to the corresponding objects modeled in an as-designed BIM. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952360129

However, the locations of individual light fixtures within a building are not easily differentiable; as such, facility managers cannot distinguish and control each fixture. Virtual models contain semantic representations of objects that enable users to visually identify, distinguish, and interactively monitor building components, thus providing opportunities for controlling components. To monitor and control light fixtures from these models, each physical fixture needs to be tightly integrated with its virtual representation in order to enable bidirectional coordination. Bidirectional coordination between virtual models and physical light fixtures offers tremendous opportunities for enhancing progress monitoring during construction and performance monitoring and control during the operations and maintenance phase of a building's life cycle. This paper presents an approach to facilitating this through cyber-physical systems integration between virtual models and physical light fixtures. The importance of actively monitoring and controlling light fixtures is highlighted.

An increasing number of smart construction sites have been designed using different techniques to reduce injuries caused by construction accidents and achieve proactive risk control. However, comprehensive smart construction site safety management solutions and applications have yet to be developed. Thus, this study proposes a smart construction site framework for safety management. Design/methodology/approach: A safety management system based on a cyber-physical system is proposed. The system establishes risk data synchronization mapping between the virtual construction and physical construction sites through scene reconstruction design, data awareness, data communication and data processing modules. Personnel, mechanical and other risks on site will be warned and controlled. Findings: The results of the case study have proved the management benefits of the system. On-site workers gradually realized that they should enter the construction site based on the standard process. And the number of people close to the construction hazard areas decreased. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in the technology of smart construction site. The modeling speed can be faster, the data collection can be timelier, and the identification of unsafe behavior can be integrated into the system. Construction quality and efficiency issues in a virtual construction site will also be solved in further research. Practical implications: In this paper, this system is actually applied in the mega project management process. More practical projects can use the management ideas and method of this paper to ensure on-site safety. Originality/value: This study is among the first attempts to build a complete smart construction site based on CPS and apply it in practice.

Apart from their frequent use for as-planned buildings, BIM authoring tools have now been adopted for a number of years for digitising existing buildings as well, mostly by performing a ‘scan-to-BIM’ process: the creation of a BIM model, primarily based on point clouds. However, some inherent characteristics of existing buildings are complicating such a process: uncertainties, geometric irregularities, classification of heritage building components, linking sources about the real-world asset and an interdisciplinarity that may go beyond traditional Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) topics (e.g. heritage, Facility Management, sensor data and damage assessment). In this paper, a framework called ‘scan-to-graph’ (STG) is proposed to integrate the concepts of scan-to-BIM with Semantic Web technologies, as these could provide answers to the above-mentioned challenges, most notably on documentation of uncertainties, sources and modelling decisions, element classification and cross-discipline information linking. In order to test the STG concept, a use case was developed where the Audience Room of the Gravensteen castle in Ghent was reconstructed from point clouds, semantically enriched and stored as an RDF graph.

The research presents a new concept, which shows how the BIM can be exploited efficiently during maintenance. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, existing facility management (FM) processes were investigated to find out how to digitize them and identify bottlenecks. Second, BIM’s data content was explored to identify the information that could be used to streamline FM processes. Third, the potential of the active data measured in the building was evaluated. Finally, research was undertaken to find out how constantly fluctuating information can be combined with BIM objects and what kind of added value that combination could offer. The literature review was used to support the primary contribution. In addition, the research problems were described and the basics of the research were obtained by interviews. The author has interviewed 27 professionals from several stakeholders. Findings: The first finding is that the BIM can serve as a platform for building use, various services and management when it has been adequately generated during the planning and construction phases and enriched before being commissioned. The other essential finding is the theory of conditions data model (CDM), which is a technical environment that combines active data with BIM. The most important advantages of BIM in FM are as follows: • Building owner attains better user satisfaction, acquires better quality and smarter services, saves energy, ensures better indoor conditions and improves building profitability. • Service providers can develop and offer new services, speed up operations, save resources and generate more profits. • The occupant gets a better user experience, faster and higher quality services and better indoor conditions. Research limitations/implications: The CDM enables to generate for the real estate and construction (RE&C) sector a novel BIM-based ecosystem with standard rules, instead of every individual operator developing his/her own unique solution for BIM use in FM. This will have an impact on the entire RE&C sector’s operating methods and will have significant financial implications in the near future. Application of this research is limited to office buildings where indoor condition measuring is undertaken continuously and where the knowledge of the use cases of spaces is available. In addition, the proper BIM in the Industry Foundation Classes format must exist. The evaluation of the validity of big data is not discussed in this article. Visualization of data and content of user interfaces will be the topic of another article by the author. This article does not deal with intricate technical details, but crucial issues are defined. Originality/value: The article presents a unique method for BIM use in FM. The theory of CDM (how to combine active data with BIM) is completely new and a similar solution has not been presented earlier. The theory of the presented method will be the crucial key for BIM use and will lead worldwide commissioning. Currently, the theory is under test in the practical pilot project.

Extracting knowledge from data on near hits (aka. close calls) might warrant better understanding on the root causes that lead to such incidents and eliminate them early in the risk mitigation process. While a close call is a subtle event where workers are in close proximity to a hazard, its frequency depends–among other factors–on poor site layout, a worker's willingness to take risks, limited safety education, and pure coincidence. For these reasons, pioneering organizations have recognized the potential of gathering and analyzing leading indicator data on close calls. However, mostly manual approaches are infrequently performed, subjective due to situational assessment, imprecise in level of detail, and importantly, reactive or inconsistent in effective or timely follow-ups by management. While existing predictive analytics research targets change at strategic levels in the hierarchy of organizations, personalized feedback to strengthen an individual worker's hazard recognition and avoidance skill set is yet missing. This study tackles the bottom of Heinrich's safety pyramid by providing an in-depth quantitative analysis of close calls. Modern positioning technology records trajectory data, whereas computational algorithms automatically generate previously unavailable details to close call events. The derived information is embedded in simplified geometric information models that users on a construction site can retrieve, easily understand, and adapt in existing preventative hazard recognition and control processes.

Furthermore, legislators demand data-driven asset management decisions based on objective, quantitative and reliable bridge condition and performance evaluation. To explore the current state-of-the-art in objective performance and condition evaluation of constructed systems by leveraging technology, a 30-year old freeway bridge in New Jersey, exhibiting multiple complex performance deficiencies, was transformed into a field laboratory. To identify the root causes of performance concerns, Visual Inspection, Operational Monitoring, Forced Excitation Testing, Controlled Load Testing, Non-destructive Probes, Long-term Monitoring, Finite Element Modelling and Parameter Identification were conducted within a Structural Identification framework. The results showed that root causes of some performance deficiencies of the test bridge were identified definitively only through the application of field measurements and analyses integrated by following a scientific approach—i.e. Structural Identification. Controlled Proof-Load Testing was especially useful in demonstrating the location and impacts of damage and the remaining capacity although such an approach can only be considered for the most critical cases due to its high cost and disruption to operations. Operational monitoring was shown as a sufficient and much cheaper alternative for structural identification permitting the development of a 3D digital twin of the bridge, which proved critical in identifying the root causes of its deficiencies and formulating meaningful interventions. Without an a-priori model used for designing the experiments as well as a model (i.e. a digital twin) calibrated by parameter identification and used for simulations, it was not possible to offer options for corrective measures confidently.

A linear static analysis was performed to investigate the instantaneous impacts of dead and wind loads on the complex concrete structure which was completed in 1973. A quasistatic analysis was performed to predict the effects of creep and shrinkage due to dead load on the structure in 2050 to discern its longevity. In 2050, the Sydney Opera House is expected to experience 0.090% element strain due to creep and shrinkage and therefore suffer prestress losses of 32.59 kN per strand. However, given that the current time after prestress loading is approximately 50 years, the majority of creep and shrinkage effects have already taken place with 0.088% strain and 32.12 kN of prestress losses. The analysis concludes that very minor structural impacts are expected over the next 30 years due to creep and shrinkage, suggesting a change in conservation focus from large structural concerns to inspection and maintenance of minor issues of surface cracking and water ingress. The analysis is the first step in the application of more complex finite element modelling of the structure with the integration of complex building information models.

The developed estimator is a Proportional Observer (PO) that exploits a linear, frequency independent, relation between the estimated state-space vector and the measurements. To improve its accuracy, the PO concept is then extended to the definition of a sequence of proportional observers, each one acting on a signal decomposition provided by wavelet multi-resolution analysis, or a Multi-Resolution Proportional Observer (MR-PO). The considered numerical test case is a straight, uniform beam with an unmodeled stiffness reduction provided by a notch, which allows for characterizing analytically this model uncertainty. The input data is given by virtual strain measurements collected on the top face of the beam, whereas the estimated state variables are the time dependent coordinates of the modal expansion of the vertical displacement along the beam elastic axis. An optimization solver, which minimizes the estimation error, is employed to get the gain matrix of the proposed observers.

In particular, generation of geometric inputs for existing building models requires significant manual intervention due to the absence, or outdated nature of available data or digital measurements. Additionally, solutions based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) also require high quality and precise geometrically-based models, which are not typically available for existing buildings. As such, this work introduces a semi-automated BEPS input solution for existing building exteriors that can be integrated with other related technologies (such as BIM or CityGML) and deployed across an entire building stock. Within the overarching approach, a novel sub-process automatically transforms a point cloud obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner into a representation of a building's exterior façade geometry as input data for a BEPS engine. Semantic enrichment is performed manually. This novel solution extends two existing approaches: (1) an angle criterion in boundary detection and (2) a voxelisation representation to improve performance. The use of laser scanning data reduces temporal costs and improves input accuracy for BEPS model generation of existing buildings. The approach is tested herein on two example cases. Vertical and horizontal accuracies of 1% and 7% were generated, respectively, when compared against independently produced, measured drawings. The approach showed variation in accuracy of model generation, particularly for upper floors of the test case buildings.

The resulting modeling cost counteracts the expected benefits of the twin. This cost and effort can be reduced by automating the process of creating such models. The first perceived challenge to achieving such automation is detecting masts from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data because their position and function (separating substructure from superstructure) is critical to the subsequent detection of other elements. This paper presents a method that tackles the aforementioned challenge by leveraging the highly regulated and standardized nature of railways. In railway infrastructure, the geometric relations of a unit contain overhead line equipment (OLE) between two mast pairs are consistent and repetitive throughout the track. The proposed method starts with tools for cleaning the PCD and roughly detecting its positioning and orientation. The resulting data sets are then processed by restricting the search region of the masts considering its positions compared with the track centerline. Subsequently, the masts are detected using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The final deliverables of the method include the coordinates of the mast positions, detected point clusters and three-dimensional (3D) models of the masts in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The method was implemented in a prototype and tested on three railway PCDs with a cumulative length of 18 km. The results indicated that the method achieves an overall detection rate of 94%.

Their application for supporting real-time operational decisions has been also gaining increasing interest over the past decade. Accurate end-user nodal demands are critical to the reliability of hydraulic simulations for real-time decision support. Conventionally, nodal demands are set to a handful of periodically updated ensembles of demand patterns, which cannot represent the vast heterogeneity and volatility of demands. With advances in metering technology, consumption data with unprecedentedly high temporal and spatial resolutions are available to water utilities on a real-time basis. A framework is developed here to create a dynamic demand assignment hydraulic model, in which consumption data are assigned to nodes to update the water network model with the streaming data from the data center and without interruption of the hydraulic simulation run. The developed framework is cloud-based and scalable, making it suitable for water distribution systems of all sizes. The framework modifies the core EPANET engine to directly assign updated demands in order to overcome current software limitations. The model is applied and demonstrated using a real-world case study in the US. The results show the importance of the real-time demand assignment for the reliability of hydraulic models for making real-time operational decisions and the realization of digital twins of water infrastructure systems. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083190839

The buildings were Grade II listed by Historic England for architectural and structural features. The buildings were also a key element of the industrial heritage and folklore of the surrounding area. As the site was due to undergo major renovation work, this project was initiated to develop a HBIM of the site that encapsulated both tangible and intangible heritage data. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the research in this study combined multiple research methods. Building on an analysis of secondary data surrounding HBIM, a community of practice was established to shape the development of an HBIM execution plan (HBEP) and underpin the collaborative BIM development. The tangible HBIM geometry was predominantly developed using a scan to BIM methodology, whereas intangible heritage data were undertaken using unstructured interviews and a focus group used to inform the presentation approach of the HBIM data. Findings: The project produced a collaboratively generated multi-building HBIM. The study identified the need for a dedicated HBEP that varies from prevailing BIM execution plans on construction projects. Tangible geometry of the buildings was modelled to LOD3 of the Historic England guidelines. Notably, the work identified the fluid nature of intangible data and the need to include this in an HBIM to fully support design, construction and operation of the building after renovation. A methodology was implemented to categorise intangible heritage data within a BIM context and an approach to interrogate these data from within existing BIM software tools. Originality/Value: The paper has presented an approach to the development of HBIM for large sites containing multiple buildings/assets. The framework implemented for an HBEP can be reproduced by future researchers and practitioners wishing to undertake similar projects. The method for identifying and categorising intangible heritage information through the developed level of intangible cultural heritage was presented as new knowledge. The development of HBIM to bring together tangible and intangible data has the potential to provide a model for future work in the field and augment existing BIM data sets used during the asset lifecycle. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085055762

This research presents a practical method of creating an energy model of a modern office building using a Building Information Modelling (BIM)–Infra-Red Thermography (IRT)–Heat Flux sensors (HFS) framework that ensures a high level of accuracy with relative ease. The energy model is created with little input of the HVAC system, simulating real-life lack-of-information scenarios, and subsequently verified with consumption data extracted from the building’s own energy metre and the district’s chiller plant it’s connected to. The calibrated model is then used to investigate various passive heat-gain reduction measures through the building envelope such as the effect of the building’s orientation, shading, insulation levels, and window performance. Limitations of conserving energy through the building envelope were highlighted through the law of diminishing returns and the SHGC was pointed out to be the single most effective thermophysical window property in conserving energy. Numerically, the replacement of the windows saved 1.6% compared to the total 2.77% of energy saved.

While such systems are already employed in many application fields to increase the flexibility and performance of automated processes, a transfer to the operation of automated adaptive façades has not yet been investigated. In this study, a prototype is developed to systematically test the application of individual cyber-physical system criteria to façades. The prototype is organized in modules, each of which represents one instance of the selected façade functions of solar shading, natural and mechanical ventilation, and heating and cooling. The emphasis lies on development of a communication system that allows the functions to communicate and cooperate with each other. Evaluation of the prototype takes place in five independent case studies, in which the potential of the cyber-physical implementation is demonstrated by a successful system-internal cooperation. The study found that important aspects of cyber-physical systems, like their embedded control, the integration of actuators and sensor networks, implementation of a communication system and connection to a digital twin, are also feasible and promising in the façade domain. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083000344

This automatic approach is based on three main steps. The first involves extracting the useful information automatically from rasterized plans by using image processing techniques that include segmentation, filtering, dilation, erosion, and contour detection. This information feeds the knowledge base of an expert system for BIM model generation. In the second step, using the knowledge base of the expert system, the information required to inform the BIM model can be deduced. The range of information thus obtainable can be extended beyond the examples given. The paper concludes with a discussion of the final stage: the automatic generation of an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) information model with all the desired geometric, physical and technical information. This can be accomplished by using one of the available open-source application program interfaces (APIs).

However, BIM has not been widely implemented in the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. As-is information for the majority of existing buildings is not complete and even outdated or incorrect. Lack of accurate and complete as-is information is still one of the key reasons leading to the low-level efficiency in O&M. BIM performs as an intelligent platform and a database that stores, links, extracts and exchanges information in construction projects. It has shown promising opportunities and advantages in BIM applications for the improvement in O&M. Hence, an effective and convenient approach to record as-is conditions of the existing buildings and create as-is BIM objects would be the essential step for improving efficiency and effectiveness of O&M, and furthermore possibly refurbishment of the building. Many researchers have paid attention to different systems and approaches for automated and real-time object recognition in past decades. This paper summarizes state-of-the-art statistical matching-based object recognition methods and then presents the image-based Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM object creation application, which extracts object information by simply conducting point-and-click operations. Furthermore, the object recognition research system is introduced, including recognizing structure object types and their corresponding materials. This paper combines the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) with the fuzzy set theory to be Fuzzy-MAUT, since the MAUT allows complex and powerful combinations of various criteria and fuzzy set theory assists improving the performance of this system. With the goal of creating an effective method for as-is IFC BIM objects construction, this image-based object recognition system and its recognition process are further validated and tested.

Proximity data were collected from tagged steel components during the installation process and compared with that obtained from the design model. Experiments were conducted to determine the accuracy of the swarm nodes. The error obtained from the experiments was used to set a buffer or tolerance around the components for accurately capturing the installation status in the developed system.
