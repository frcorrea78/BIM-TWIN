The article describes a universal approach to the formation of these complex unique structures as real estate. The paper describes methods of forming and determining the boundaries of underground complexes, metro stations, which were tested separately for different structures and their combination. The calculation results allowed identifying different categories of non-residential premises located in the underground levels of the metro stations. © 2016 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007240157
