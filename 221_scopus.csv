Thanks to its many advantages, BIM is already practiced in many construction projects throughout the entire world. However, the fragmented nature of the construction industry still impedes its more widespread use. Government initiatives around the world play an important role in increasing BIM adoption: as the largest client of the construction industry in many countries, the state has the power to significantly change its work practices. This chapter discusses the motivation for applying BIM, offers a detailed definition of BIM along with an overview of typical use cases, describes the common BIM maturity grades and reports on BIM adoption levels in various countries around the globe. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

It provides approaches and software architectures for facilitating the interaction with (and between) BIMs through Web services, and for enabling and facilitating the fusion of the information residing in such models or of information acquired from IoT technologies. The proposed software architectures are presented in the form of design patterns. This information fusion will facilitate many novel application fields ranging from emergency response, to urban monitoring and surveillance, and to smart buildings. The book consists of 8 chapters. The first 2 chapters focus on the basics of BIMs, while chapter 3 presents fundamental service-oriented architecture patterns for complex information models. Subsequently, chapters 4 and 5 elaborate on the hardware and software side of IoT, with a special focus on their use for BIMs. Chapter 6 provides advanced SOA patterns for BIMs, while chapter 7 details patterns for IoT, and for BIM and IoT information fusion. Lastly, chapter 8 summarizes the work and provides an outlook on promising future developments. Overall, the book will be beneficial for researchers and developers in the fields of building information models, IoT applications, and systems integration. © 2015 The Author(s).

By only introducing consulting engineers to participate in the later stages of the design process, engineers are commonly assigned a fi xing role. This provides little opportunity for creative engineering solutions at the generative stage. Optioneering, a new business management model, however, offers the possibility of a new collaborative method for interaction between designers and their partners.

Moreover, these tools can be tied to a BIM model. The aim of this research is to set up a lean methodology to fulfil CESBA requirements through Construction to Operations Building information exchange - COBie in project on existing buildings adopting the BIM Bronze approach by UK Ministry of Justice - MoJ. This will allow to develop a semantic model and to extract sustainability reports in a post-construction phase, thereby minimising the cost of gathering information on existing buildings.

Design Optioneering involves first defining a range of design options using associative parametric design tools; then coupling this model with integrated simulation-based analysis; and, finally, using computational design optimization methods to systematically search though the defined range of alternatives in search of design options that best achieve the problem objectives while satisfying any constraints. The Design Optioneering method was tested by students as part of a parametric design course at Stanford University in the spring of 2010. The performance of the method are discussed in terms of the student's ability to capture the design intent using parametric modeling, integrate expert analysis domains, and select a preferred option among a large number of alternatives. Finally, the potential of Design Optioneering to reduce latency, further domain integration, and enable the evaluation of more design alternatives in practice is discussed. © 2011 ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053168234
