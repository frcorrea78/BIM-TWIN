Each module embodies its own lifecycle, which implies an additional product complexity in terms of module design, module management and module removal from the product. The authors provide reasons why the holistic view on the product lifecycle management is critical for an efficient PLM, and present a new approach for PLM-Processs Management in a multi-lifecycle environment The paper closes with the presentation of a short case study validating the proposed process design for a company in the telecommunications industry.

However, the modern IoE (Internet of Everything) technology is able to cover a new dimension in terms of monitoring and controlling an operating state of a products or process. The potential is high to reach a new maturity level in all PLM processes. Unfortunately, it is a very complex topic and has a high impact on internal and external processes. The technical challenges are spread in different domains. The business value is hard to see. Therefore the risks are also high and a well-grounded strategy is necessary. This includes an organic growth with customer benefit and a consistent change management in the company. Besides a successful implementations of digital twins this guide provides a pragmatic approach to get access to the digital twin technology. It covers the range from the conceptual understanding of a digital twin to a successful implementation with a prototype. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058536698

The Internet of Everything (IoE) offers many potential opportunities and benefits to both service providers and customers. This paper aims to integrate knowledge from diverse fields into a comprehensive, practical approach for development and implementation of products and services using IoE technologies. The research focused especially on the needs and challenges of innovation and product managers who have to find ways to cope with rising uncertainties and the problem of increasingly complex business environments and digitalization. Therefore, this paper presents first learnings that guides practitioners through implementation of industrial IoE and its impact on new product development and management. It gives them guidance on how the companies’ IoE projects could be linked with its new product development initiatives. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039437306
