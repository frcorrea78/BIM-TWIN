With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960269657

The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle. Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis, awareness raising and education and training are important activities to address the challenges of BIM usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881611317

This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This research tested the hypotheses that safety training in a virtual reality (VR) construction site would be feasible and more effective, in terms of workers' learning and recall in identifying and assessing construction safety risks, than would equivalent training using conventional methods. Sixty-six subjects were provided training in construction safety and their safety knowledge was tested prior to the training, immediately afterward, and one month later. Half of the subjects received traditional classroom training with visual aids; the other half were trained using a 3D immersive VR power-wall. Significant advantage was found for VR training for stone cladding work and for cast-in-situ concrete work, but not for general site safety. VR training was more effective in terms of maintaining trainees' attention and concentration. Training with VR was more effective over time, especially in the context of cast-in-situ concrete works. Given the need for improved training and the advantages of training using VR, incorporation of VR in construction safety training is strongly recommended. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887108669

It is one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns. Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management.

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long ""lookahead"" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights - through various construction scenarios - into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

Field experience shows that energy savings of 5-30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900427828

In this regard, the use of building information modelling (BIM) tools has arisen as a new trend in the construction industry to improve the sustainable assessments of buildings in the design phase. For that purpose, current approaches either focus on the use of BIM together with several programs, or solely use it for an automatic quantity take-off. However, as noted in the literature, the lack of semantic information within BIM models can lead to ineffective decision-making processes and models that are unsuitable for the operation and maintenance stages. Therefore, the present study explores the potential of BIM as a repository for the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) information, and how that information should be used for an environmental and economic analysis. By doing so, the authors intend to discuss the potential of BIM as a data repository and its capacity for supporting an automatic/semi-automatic environmental and economic assessment. A BIM-LCA/LCC framework was proposed, which led to the development of an information delivery manual and a model view definition (IDM/MVD), using the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, for the integration and exchange of information within a BIM-based environment. Finally, the authors implemented the proposed framework with a case study. It is observed that, although most recent IFC schemes already consider some of the required information, a considerable number of properties are still required to conduct a comprehensive LCA and LCC analysis. Thus, the work presented here contributes to the existing background knowledge necessary for future implementations of BIM-based LCA/LCC and for software developers to develop a suitable BIM-LCA/LCC tool. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062972950

These have informed the development of a building monitoring ontology framework and its underpinning ontologies (sensor ontology, building ontology, and other supporting ontologies).

The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028979335

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580153

The use of BIM technology in the commercial construction industry has grown enormously in recent years. Its application to FM, however, is still limited. The literature highlights issues that hinder BIM–FM integration, which are studied and discussed in detail in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature is conducted to identify and categorize key issues hampering the application of BIM to FM. This paper has also designed a questionnaire based on a literature review and surveyed FM professionals at two industry events. Using the collected responses, these issues are analyzed and discussed using non-parametric statistical analyses. Findings: A total of 16 issues are identified through the literature review of 54 studies under the four categories of BIM-execution and information-management, technological, cost-based and legal and contractual issues. The results of the survey of FM professionals (with 57 complete responses) reveal that the single most important issue is the lack of FM involvement in project phases when BIM is evolving. Originality/value: The findings of this study could assist the construction industry (e.g. building-material and equipment manufacturers, design professionals, general contractors, construction managers, owners and facility managers) with creating guidelines that would help in BIM–FM integration.

Even with the use of open data exchange format such as IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), getting the data out of BIM is still not an easy task. This research focuses on defining a schema and transformation rules to bring BIM data into a form that is easily queried. The schema is defined using popular relational database structure following an established star schema model that is well-defined within the data warehouse domain. The primary aim of the concept is to allow flexible and efficient queries into the BIM data using standard SQL that removes restrictions on predefined queries, effectively transforming BIM data into an open and queryable database. Another major contribution of this research is the significant potential for supporting spatial queries. This is a critical feature often neglected in the current approach to BIM-based databases. This paper presents the integration of spatial operations into standardized SQL queries making the BIM data accessible for wide ranges of query capabilities.

Although the causes of this ‘performance gap’ are multi-faceted, issues surrounding data integration are key contributory factors. The distributed nature of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry presents many challenges to the effective capture, integration and assessment of building performance data. Not all building data can be described semantically, nor is it feasible to create adapters between many different software tools. Similarly, not all building contextual data can easily be captured in a single product-centric model. This paper presents a new solution to the problem based upon a hybrid architecture that links data which is retained in its original format. The architecture links existing and efficient relational databases storing time-series data and semantically-described building contextual data. The main contribution of this work is an original RDF syntax structure and ontology to represent existing database schema information, and a new mechanism that automatically prepares data streams for processing by rule-based performance definitions. Two test cases evaluate the concept by 1) applying the hybrid architecture to building performance data from an actual building, and 2) evaluating the efficiency of the architecture against a purely RDF-based solution that also stores all of the time-series data in RDF for a virtual building. The hybrid architecture also avoids the duplication of time-series data and overcomes some of the differences found in database schemas and database platforms. © 2016",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982793329

Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews –in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies– with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of ‘BIM for FM’ processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies.

Taking building energy performance analysis as an example, in comparison with other domestic and foreign research, the important contributions of the study include: (1) Based on a design decision-making perspective, a Green BIM-based decision-making cycle can integrate the practical steps of BIM and BPA. (2) Furthermore, this study also finds that meteorological data in a format that can be used in BPA is not easy to obtain. Nevertheless, virtual weather station technology developed using cloud technology can enable a building project to obtain simulated meteorological data relying on weather stations closest to the required criteria, and a cloud building energy analysis engine can be used to implement complex analysis involving large amount of data. As a result, the use of green-BIM technology and concepts can be promoted with greater ease. When setting energy conservation targets, this study recommends that building energy usage intensity (EUI) be employed as an integrated performance indicator for energy consumption, and percentage of performance optimization be employed as a rating criterion. Nevertheless, the use of energy conservation targets is not essential; depending on the directions in which national governments would like to lead the industry and the maturity and feasibility of relevant technologies, other feasible high-performance benchmarks proposed in this study may also be used in Green BIM. © 2017 CAD Solutions, LLC.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010654077

In this paper, we present our approach to the problem of mobile indoor localization with a given building model. The approach does not use external sensors or input. Accurate external sensors such as stationary cameras may be expensive and difficult to set up and maintain. Relying on already existing external sources may also prove to be difficult, as especially inside buildings, Internet connections can be unreliable and GPS signals can be inaccurate. Therefore, we try to find a localization solution for augmented reality devices that can accurately localize itself only with data from internal sensors and preexisting information about the building. If a building has an accurate model of its geometry, we can use modern spatial mapping techniques and point-cloud matching to find a mapping between local device coordinates and global model coordinates. We use normal analysis and 2D template matching on an inverse distance map to determine this mapping. The proposed algorithm is designed to have a high speed and efficiency, as mobile devices are constrained by hardware limitations.

The algorithm underpinning the DSS enables the maintenance optimization through a wiser allocation of economic resources. Therefore, the primary metric encompassed in the DSS is a revised version of the Facility Condition Index (FCI). This metric is combined with an index measuring the service life of the assets, one measuring the preference of the owner and another measuring the criticality of each component in the asset. The four indexes are combined to obtain a Maintenance Priority Index (MPI) that can be employed for maintenance budget allocation. The robustness of the DSS has been tested on an office building in Italy and provided good results.

For sure, one technology with a strong impact is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT paradigm made it possible to break down the data barrier between the vertical domains on which the traditional information and communication technology (ICT) world was organized. Recently, the designers of home automation systems have begun looking to the IoT paradigm to ease the deployment of systems that are able to collect data from different plants. Such a situation has driven further evolution from the traditional automation system, where logic is defined by the programmer or by the user, to a cognitive system that is able to learn from the user’ habits regarding what should be the best configuration of plants. Several countries are funding renovations of public and private buildings for improving energy efficiency. Generally, such renovations are only focusing on the structure of the building and of its energy performance (e.g., the thermal envelope, window units, air-conditioning plants, and renewable generators) and largely ignoring the use of intelligent devices. On the contrary, scientific literature and practice have demonstrated that the wider use of IoT sensors, as well as distributed and remote intelligence, is fundamental to optimize energy consumption. This research work aimed to identify issues due the application of cognitive solutions during the renovation phase of buildings. In particular, the paper presents a cognitive architecture to support the operation and management phases of buildings, thanks to the massive digitalization of the entire supply chain of the construction sector from the single building element to the entire construction process. Such an architecture is capable of combining data from the IoT sensors and actuators of smart objects installed during the renovation phase, as well as legacy building automation systems. As an indication of the capability of the proposed solution, an intelligent window device was developed and validated. Within the Energy, Life Styled, and Seismic Innovation for Regenerated Buildings (ELISIR) project, window units are equipped with sensors to monitor indoor and outdoor condition behaviours of users. In addition, windows are able to react to changes in the environment by means of actuators that enable motorized opening and shading. Thanks to the cognitive layer designed in the project, the window is able to automatically define the best rules for opening and shading by using the local controller to satisfy user’s habits and energy effciency targets. The cognitive layer defines the appropriate rules for opening and shading using the decision tree algorithm applied to the data generated by the sensors in order to infer users’ preferences. For this research, two prototypes of the window units were installed in two offces of Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The accuracy of this algorithm to classify the users’ behaviour and preferences was found to be around 90%, considering an observation interval of two months. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the most common applications concerns the dynamic adaptation of indoor conditions according to the occupancy variation. However, other implementations are possible. Occupancy data could also enhance maintenance smart contracts management, especially if coupled with a contracts’ management system as blockchain through which it is possible to achieve higher reliability and trust in transactions. In this article, a methodology to monitor occupancy data with a low-cost network, composed by a set of ultrasonic sensors, is presented. To ensure the collection of consistent data, different tests were performed for defining a convenient configuration for their installation. Following the proposed methodology, gathered data are processed and stored into a digital asset model associated with the building maintenance plan. Once a predefined threshold is reached, the system triggers a maintenance alert to the contractor to activate cleaning operations. The proposed approach enables an enhancement of the automation of maintenance management operations in a cost-effective manner. However, further validation trials are required to test the flexibility of its application in different space types. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086911681
