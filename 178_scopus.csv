Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879854889

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection. © 2014 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907031476

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this paper, we examine the scenario of a heterogeneous network with nodes and content of various types. Such networks are notoriously difficult to mine because of the bewildering combination of heterogeneous contents and structures. The creation of a multidimensional embedding of such data opens the door to the use of a wide variety of off-the-shelf mining techniques for multidimensional data. Despite the importance of this problem, limited efforts have been made on embedding a network of scalable, dynamic and heterogeneous data. In such cases, both the content and linkage structure provide important cues for creating a unified feature representation of the underlying network. In this paper, we design a deep embedding algorithm for networked data. A highly nonlinear multi-layered embedding function is used to capture the complex interactions between the heterogeneous data in a network. Our goal is to create a multi-resolution deep embedding function, that reflects both the local and global network structures, and makes the resulting embedding useful for a variety of data mining tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that the rich content and linkage information in a heterogeneous network can be captured by such an approach, so that similarities among cross-modal data can be measured directly in a common embedding space. Once this goal has been achieved, a wide variety of data mining problems can be solved by applying off-the-shelf algorithms designed for handling vector representations. Our experiments on real-world network datasets show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art embedding methods.

Another noticeable shift has been from the undesirable toward the desirable qualities of air movement. Additionally, sophisticated models covering the physics and physiology of the human body were developed, driven by the continuous challenge to model thermal comfort at the same anatomical resolution and to combine these localized signals into a coherent, global thermal perception.

The drive to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the increasing installation of meters and sensors for monitoring energy use and indoor environmental conditions in buildings. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in building energy metering and environmental monitoring, including their social, economic, environmental and legislative drivers. The integration of meters and sensors with existing building energy management systems (BEMS) is critically appraised, especially with regard to communication technologies and protocols such as ModBus, M-Bus, Ethernet, Cellular, ZigBee, WiFi and BACnet. Findings suggest that energy metering is covered in existing policies and regulations in only a handful of countries. Most of the legislations and policies on energy metering in Europe are in response to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 2002/91/EC. However, recent developments in policy are pointing towards more stringent metering requirements in future, moving away from voluntary to mandatory compliance. With regards to metering equipment, significant developments have been made in the recent past on miniaturisation, accuracy, robustness, data storage, ability to connect using multiple communication protocols, and the integration with BEMS and the Cloud - resulting in a range of available solutions, selection of which can be challenging. Developments in communication technologies, in particular in low-power wireless such as ZigBee and Bluetooth LE (BLE), are enabling cost-effective machine to machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) implementation of sensor networks. Privacy and data protection, however, remain a concern for data aggregators and end-users. The standardization of network protocols and device functionalities remains an active area of research and development, especially due to the prevalence of many protocols in the BEMS industry. Available solutions often lack interoperability between hardware and software systems, resulting in vendor lock-in.

Kano's satisfaction model, developed originally in the context of marketing, is adapted and tested for its suitability in the context of building occupants' satisfaction. Analyses were conducted on the occupant survey database from Center for the Built Environment (CBE) to estimate individual impacts of 15 IEQ factors on occupants' overall satisfaction, depending on the building's performance in relation to those IEQ factors. These empirical analyses identified nonlinearities between some IEQ factors and occupant satisfaction; some IEQ factors had a predominantly negative impact on occupants' overall satisfaction when the building underperformed.

Other IEQ factors had a predominantly linear relationship with overall satisfaction - increments or decrements of equal magnitude in the building's performance on these factors lead to a broadly similar magnitude of enhancement or diminution of occupants' overall satisfaction.

Therefore, this research has relied on experiments using human subjects in an environmental chamber to investigate and determine how skin temperatures change, depending on the ambient thermal conditions, and to identify which data type and body segment generate the most significant physiological information that will represent the overall thermal sensation.For this study, the experiments were conducted with 26 volunteers in an experimental chamber for about 2. h each, while the indoor temperature was changed from 20. °C to 30. °C. Results of this study revealed that skin temperature change rates (gradients) were more consistent with the thermal comfort condition than with the actual levels of skin temperatures of participants, and that the measured skin temperatures at their wrists provided more interpretable data than that of any other body segments.

We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25% outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models.

However, research has not reached the phase where the root causes of BEPG could be effectively identified, managed, and eliminated. There remains a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the current literature to understand the current state of play, and set directions for future research. To fill this gap, in this paper, a thorough survey and review of BEPG research was carried out. The paper collected and analyzed 227 relevant publications and developed a framework for better understanding previous BEPG research. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of BEPG research was conducted to explore its causes and corresponding strategies (including design concept, “hard” technologies and “soft” measures). Not only the interaction among causes but also the strengths and limitations of corresponding strategies were discussed in detail. Future research is finally recommended based on the limitations of exist strategies, including (1) building energy performance life-cycle thinking; (2) energy performance information integrity; (3) big data collection and analytical method; (4) stakeholders’ attributions, decision criteria and behavior; (5) stakeholder interactions; (6) modelling and simulation validation; (7) multidisciplinary approach; and (8) building system flexibility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053104187

Although recent advances in deep feature learning offer a promising route towards these tasks, they are limited in application domains where high-quality and large-scale training data are expensive to obtain. In this article, we propose a novel deep feature learning paradigm based on social collective intelligence, which can be acquired from the inexhaustible social multimedia content on the Web, in particular, largely social images and tags. Differing from existing feature learning approaches that relyon high-quality image-label supervision, our weak supervision isacquired by mining the visual-semantic embeddings from noisy, sparse, and diverse social image collections. The resultant imageword embedding space can be used to (1) fine-tune deep visual models for low-level feature extractions and (2) seek sparse representations as high-level cross-modal features for both image and text. We offer an easy-to-use implementation for the proposed paradigm, which is fast and compatible with any state-of-the-art deep architectures. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that the cross-modal features learned by our paradigm significantly outperforms others in various applications such as content-based retrieval, classification, and image captioning. © 2016 ACM.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000842805

The method embodies separate analyses for longwave (thermal infrared) radiation, induced drafts, and solar load effects. Of these three impacts, modeling results demonstrate that longwave exchange between the body and the window is the most significant except for the case where the body is in direct sun, in which case the impact of solar load can be more significant. For most residential-sized windows, draft effects exist but are typically small. Generally, windows are not the primary element affecting the comfort of a building's occupants. However, when a window is very hot or cold, the occupant is very close to the window, or other factors result in thermal conditions near the edge of the comfort zone, windows can become quite influential. Furthermore, it is believed that current methods may underpredict discomfort caused by windows. We discuss potential refinements to the method that might address this inaccuracy by accounting for asymmetries in radiant temperature.

Recently developed Internet-connected PCS chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide ‘just the right’ amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with PCS chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected >5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and HVAC system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) PCS control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) PCS chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96%) than typically achieved in buildings.

But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II.

Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6% overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6% lower than involving 12 input features.

Fifteen Singaporean subjects participated in a 7-day longitudinal experiment in which they carried a portable sensor that continuously recorded personal air temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration at 1-min intervals. Instantaneous TA and PAQA were regularly sampled by survey for each subject. High acceptability was found at home, restaurants and workplaces, whereas low acceptability was found for outdoor and transport environments. The participants, from Singapore's modern tropical environment spent an average of 96% of their time indoors. Weak associations were reported between acceptabilities and measured physical parameters taken independently. Clustering data by location, subject's sleeping ventilation habit, air-conditioning operation status and the changes in physical parameters over a designated time period enhanced the understanding of the acceptability results. In general, acceptability was lower for those who slept in air-conditioned environments than for those who slept without air-conditioning. The carbon dioxide mixing ratio was critical for PAQA predictions but not for TA. The Gaussian process (GP) had a better predictive power than a multiple linear regression approach. Using GP, we found that a general predictive model had comparable simulation performance as for individual predictive models.

The behavior is referred to any direct or indirect action, which is selected by an occupant to manage the unpleasant indoor environmental conditions. Thermal comfort, indoor air quality, aural comfort and visual comfort are the key factors of IEQ evaluation. Human behavior significantly interacts with energy consumption in buildings. Design/methodology/approach: Each IEQ parameter was reviewed separately and the overall IEQ acceptance was considered. In addition, this paper reviews the methods that were used to measure and simulate the IEQ factors, energy consumption and human behavior. Finally, the lack of knowledge in this field is based on the review demonstrated. Findings: Most studies considered one or two IEQ factors to evaluate IEQ acceptance in buildings. Further, weakness of simulating all IEQ factors at the same time is the deficiency of IEQ simulation, based on reviews. In the case of occupant behavior simulation, the uncertainly of human psychological parameter is a drawback to predict behavior. Originality/value: Energy consumption, occupant health and productivity are related to IEQ. Human behavior affects building energy consumption directly. Simulation software and methods can predict IEQ factors and human behavior. Therefore, reviewing the existing studies is critical to find new methods for measuring and simulating IEQ, energy consumption and human behavior in buildings. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028439531

Human perception could be helpful to capture these disparate phenomena and interpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally diverse subjective feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a methodology to collect intensive longitudinal subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments on a smartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological variables, for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification models were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series attributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart rate, and the historical preferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The most accurate model had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64%, 80% and 86% for thermal, light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion outlines how these models can enhance comfort preference prediction when supplementing data from installed sensors.

The acquisition of labelled data however remains a challenge. This paper presents a methodology for the collection of in-situ occupant feedback data using a Fitbit smartwatch. The clock-face application cozie can be downloaded free-of-charge on the Fitbit store and tailored to fit a range of occupant comfort related experiments. In the initial trial of the app, fifteen users were given a smartwatch for one month and were prompted to give feedback on their thermal preferences. In one month, with minimal administrative overhead, 1460 labelled responses were collected. This paper demonstrates how these large data sets of human feedback can be analysed to reveal a range of results from building anomalies, occupant behaviour, occupant personality clustering, and general feedback related to the building. The paper also discusses limitations in the approach and the next phase of design of the platform. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076263079

This structure augments the neighborhood graph with a bridge graph. We propose to exploit Cartesian concatenation to produce a large set of vectors, called bridge vectors, from several small sets of sub vectors. Each bridge vector is connected with a few reference vectors near to it, forming a bridge graph. Our approach finds nearest neighbors by simultaneously traversing the neighborhood graph and the bridge graph in the best-first strategy. The success of our approach stems from two factors: the exact nearest neighbor search over a large number of bridge vectors can be done quickly, and the reference vectors connected to a bridge (reference) vector near the query are also likely to be near the query. Experimental results on searching over large scale datasets (SIFT, GIST and HOG) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ANN search algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The combination of our approach with the IVFADC system~JegouDS11 also shows superior performance over the BIGANN dataset of 1 billion SIFT features compared with the best previously published result. © 2013 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898781018

The IEQ depends on factors such as lighting, noise, thermal quality, and air quality which directly or indirectly influence the occupants' behaviour and work productivity. To improve and support the work productivity of occupants, it is significant to consider occupants' physical condition, well-being and psychological facets which are affected by IEQ. Consequently, it is essential to understand initially the most effective IEQ factors that impact on occupants' behaviour and the overall satisfaction. Occupant's satisfaction can be improved by elimination or minimization factors that cause any discomfort, illness or dissatisfaction. However, most research on IEQ and occupant satisfaction are focused on conventional commercial and office buildings. There is a lack of research evaluating the performance and IEQ levels of new ""green"" buildings, in relation to work productivity. Thus, the current study reviews peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations to find crucial factor influences on IEQ and work productivity in ""green"" offices. The results showed that increasing the quality of IEQ factors will most likely enhance occupant's productivity, which directly brings benefits for companies. Through a critical literature review, the study found that Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is the most influential, which is vital for enhancing work productivity and it can boost occupants' satisfaction. Moreover, occupants' personal control over thermal condition shows the huge effect on enhancing work productivity. The results showed that there is a lack of a comprehensive study to rank the IEQ factors which effect on work productivity.

Their advantages are that they are low cost, efficient for both respondents and analysts, in addition to having higher response rates than other survey types. Their main disadvantage is the lack of control with who is voting, meaning both repeat voters and non-voters may lead to biased results. The aim of this study is to assess the representativeness and functioning of such publicly located satisfaction polling stations (SPSs) in an indoor climate setting, and to evaluate their potential for real-time evaluation of occupant's satisfaction with the indoor climate. We carried out continuous field tests in two office buildings for more than two months where the results of SPSs were compared with 473 survey results collected in 10 rounds during the tests. To assess how sensitive the instrument was to changing conditions, we deliberately changed temperature setpoints on selected days in one of the buildings. We found that the SPSs had a high and variable non-response bias which could result in a low accuracy for benchmarking of building indoor climate satisfaction. Results also showed a high correlation between SPS complaints and complaints recorded in the surveys for the thermal comfort aspect of indoor climate, including thermal comfort induced by temperature interventions. SPSs can provide valuable continuous recordings of the occupant's satisfaction with the indoor climate. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090567108

Overall satisfaction with the workspace significantly improved self-estimated job performance; increased satisfaction with temperature was estimated to provide the greatest improvement in self-estimated job performance, followed by increase in satisfaction with noise and air quality. The improvement of building features such as amount of space, visual privacy and noise level offered the highest chance to improve satisfaction with workspace.

An experiment was implemented to test the ability to characterize the preferences of occupants to match them with suitable environmentally-comfortable and spatially-efficient flexible workspaces. This approach connects occupants with a catalog of available work desks using a web-based mobile application and enables them to provide real-time environmental feedback.

These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), comfortGAN, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from comfortGAN, has higher performance (increase between 4% and 17% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by comfortGAN shrinks to 1 - 2%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097198183

The study is the first to do so with respect to a large field study. The regression analysis is done against a dataset of objective and subjective IEQ measurements collected from 779 occupants of open-plan offices in large Canadian and US cities.

On average people who are more sensitive to cold temperatures, Group 1, take 8.9 minutes from being uncomfortably cold and 25.0 minutes from being uncomfortably hot to reach comfort zones.
