Health and safety risks are among the most significant risks in construction projects since the construction industry is characterized by a relatively high injury and death rate compared to other industries. In construction project management, safety risk assessment is an important step toward identifying potential hazards and evaluating the risks associated with the hazards. Adequate prioritization of safety risks during risk assessment is crucial for planning, budgeting, and management of safety related risks. Method In this paper, a safety risk assessment framework is presented based on the theory of cost of safety (COS) model and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The main contribution of the proposed framework is that it presents a robust method for prioritization of safety risks in construction projects to create a rational budget and to set realistic goals without compromising safety. The impact to the industry The framework provides a decision tool for the decision makers to determine the adequate accident/injury prevention investments while considering the funding limits. The proposed safety risk framework is illustrated using a real-life construction project and the advantages and limitations of the framework are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879175514

However, the benefits of using BIM in the OAS of prefabricated construction cannot be cultivated with an incomplete, inaccurate, and untimely data exchange and lack of real-time visibility and traceability. To deal with these challenges, an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled platform is designed by integrating IoT and BIM for prefabricated public housing projects in Hong Kong. The demands of the stakeholders were analysed; then smart construction objects (SCOs) and smart gateway are defined and designed to collect real-time data throughout the working processes of on-site assembly of prefabricated construction using the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The captured data is uploaded to cloud in real-time to process and analyse for decision support purposes for the involved site managers and workers. Visibility and traceability functions are developed with BIM and virtual reality (VR) technologies, through which managers can supervise the construction progress and approximate cost information in a real-time manner. The IoT-enabled platform can provide various decision support tools and services to different stakeholders, for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of daily operations, decision making, collaboration, and supervision throughout on-site assembly processes of prefabricated construction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041490568

Company strengths relative to conducting business in international markets, the threats and opportunities associated with overseas work, and the costs and benefits of undertaking construction projects in specific countries need to be considered in this decision. The interactions between the complex factors can be structured in a model that can help one to make a rational judgment.

Mapping time series into a complex network with visibility graph algorithm, temporal characters and dynamics of inter-event time series of near-miss accidents has been revealed through the analysis and discussion of near-miss accident data from the city of Wuhan, China mainland metro construction. All degree distributions of the construct networks, followed by power law, demonstrate that the inter-event time series of near-miss accidents are scale-free. Moreover, the results show they all have small-world features and are highly clustered into hierarchical structures, indicating that the complex phenomenon are generally existed.

A blockchain Technology (BCT) is, in essence, a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. It was introduced as the working mechanism that formed the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain extensive mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. It was evident that the underlying principles characteristic of BCT functional attributes and secure digital infrastructure could find application in nearly any conceivable industry. BCT aims at creating a system that would be a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring and cyber-resilient system that assures the facilitation and protection of truly efficient data exchange system. This research depicts a survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and examines the potential incorporation within the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process. Furthermore, the paper investigates how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM workflow by emphasizing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The focus on collaboration and the distributed nature of both technologies imply the suitability for implementing an integrative framework, and in extension, posit that effectively leveraging DLT's robust, reliable, and secure network infrastructure, and BIM workflow processes can be significantly enhanced. The paper examines the fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their prospective future applications and current advances, and their categorization based on intrinsic characteristics of consensus reaching and permissions. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the design review process such as using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. HLF is the underlying BCT infrastructure that can serve to highlight key postulations to elucidate the idealized BIM workflow aptly. © 2019 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066924982

The current modular practices usually apply strict tolerances, ad hoc strategies, or trial-and-error solutions for geometric variability management. The consequences of improper assessment and reactive management of such unique risks can result in extensive site-fit rework, cost overruns, schedule delays, and quality issues. To address this persistent challenge in modular construction (MC), this paper presents a systematic risk management framework for the proactive management of unique modularization risks. The developed framework includes identification and evaluation of tolerance-related issues and unique modularization risks in a quantitative manner, identification of the optimum geometric variability (using either a strict or relaxed tolerance approach) by addressing the trade-offs between offsite and onsite costs, evaluation of mitigation strategy effectiveness based on tolerance theory, and representation of the results in two- and three-dimensional graphs to support decision making with respect to the optimum selection of a mitigation strategy. A case study is used to demonstrate the proposed framework, and the results show that it can be used to effectively support industry practitioners to improve modularization performance and maximize its benefits. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064868032

However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities. © 2021 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105588737

The main causes of occupational accidents in this field were identified and analyzed based on three factors; severity, detection and occurrence. Based on whether the risks are high or low priority, modifying actions were suggested to reduce the occupational risks. Finally, the results showed that high priority risks had a 40% decrease due to these actions. © 2017 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010639061

Existing literature suggests that industry-specific studies need to be conducted. The work presented in this study shows a preliminary cybersecurity threat model relevant to the AEC industry. To that end, threat models for each of the life cycle phases are proposed. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the commissioning phase of a building, which includes an autonomous robotic system to collect data as a possible countermeasure. The suggested countermeasure shows promise to address some of the cybersecurity challenges faced in the building certification and commissioning process. The results show that the likelihood of detecting rogue sensors increases with additional constraints in the monitoring robot, such as minimum and maximum distance. The illustrative models suggest that the proposed framework will help to address the safety and cyber security of stakeholders and systems during crucial phases of construction projects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099063851

The levels of operational technology (OT) to control and monitor site activities by utilizing robotic, autonomous, and remotely controlled machines raise cybersecurity concerns. As construction sites are places where humans and machines work together, the potential safety outcomes of cybersecurity vulnerabilities are magnified. This study's motivation was to understand the current state of the art and identify gaps to suggest future directions regarding OT in construction from the cybersecurity perspective. To achieve that, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. The analysis utilized the Scopus database to retrieve related publications and VOSviewer version 1.6.15 software to visualize bibliometric networks. Main research themes were identified, and each theme was reviewed from a cybersecurity perspective. The limitations of the analysis include the lack of industry-based categorization, the domination of publications focusing on the cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs), and the set of keyword combinations used for the literature search that could be expanded to cover a broader range of research topics. The findings reveal the lack of focus on the construction phase in the construction cybersecurity research. Moreover, cybersecurity aspects are absent in the construction automation studies, and there is a need for bespoke threat modeling and intrusion detection systems for all the phases of construction projects. Suggestions for further research on the potential threats against the construction phase are provided. Future directions include possible adaptations of the available cybersecurity frameworks considering the utilization of OT on construction sites and investigating the methods to evaluate security levels on construction sites and countermeasures against cyberattacks. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116325371

Although there are several studies and standards in the cybersecurity domain, experts suggest that domain-specific studies need to be conducted to address the unique challenges faced within each of the different industries. Therefore, several cybersecurity studies have been undertaken for various industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunication, and energy. However, this type of study is largely missing in the AEC industry due to different reasons, including lack of awareness. To address that, this study aims to (a) compare and analyze the number of cybersecurity-related documents in the AEC industry with several other industries, and (b) extract and analyze the cybersecurity-related documents data to identify potential future research trends and topics for the AEC community. The Web of Science (WOS) database, consisting of significant and influential journal publications, was used for document retrieval. VOSviewer was used to identify key research topics and trends in the cybersecurity domain and define future cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. WOS document retrieval results that compared the total number of publications corroborated the little to no attention received to cybersecurity investigation in the AEC industry. In addition, the VOSviewer analysis revealed three significant areas of research in the cybersecurity community that provide a reasonably justified roadmap for conducting cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. This study could greatly benefit the AEC research community and potential reaping benefits to the industry by creating more awareness among different stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Mantha and García de Soto.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107556978

An important part of this process is in many cases the implementation of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) Systems or an extended use of the PLM Systems to manage all the information that must be shared by the shipyard departments (engineering, purchasing, planning, operations, production, etc.). The solution presented in this panel for an advanced integration between the CAD and the PLM intends to comply with the most demanding requirements of the shipyards as well as to maintain the efficiency, the scalability and the performance of the shipbuilding CAD tool. This project presents in detail the architecture of the applicability solution as well as the expected advantages and benefits for any shipyard. The use of specialized shipbuilding CAD Systems in a shipbuilding environments is crucial for the efficient design and manufacturing of ships. The scalability refers to both the number of CAD users and to the number of vessel items to be handled. Vessels are very complex products that may be composed of millions of items, requiring a large number of designers, accessing concurrently to the vessel product model. The design cycles of these vessels are usually very long and there are many design changes along the whole vessel lifecycle. Performance is another critical requirement, especially in the detail design and manufacturing stages, when the detail design is almost complete, there are hundreds of users working on the model, model changes are constant and information for the production processes must be provided continuously.

In the past, research and development on standardization mainly focused on the level of component, and the standardization of the entire product as a whole is rarely taken into consideration. In this paper, the size and structure of 3D product models are both driven by the Excel datasheets, based on which a parameterized model library is therefore established. Diversiform knowledge including associated parameters and default properties are embedded into the templates in advance to simplify their reuse. Through the simple operation, we can obtain the correct product with the finished 3D models including single parts or complex assemblies.
