The objective of KBE is to reduce time and cost of product development, which is primarily achieved through automation of repetitive design tasks while capturing, retaining and re-using design knowledge. Published research on KBE is not very extensive and also quite dispersed; this paper is an effort to collect and review existing literature on KBE. A total of 50 research contributions have been analysed. The main objectives of this analysis are to identify the theoretical foundations of KBE and to identify research issues within KBE, pointing out the challenges and pitfalls that currently prohibit a wider adoption of KBE while suggesting avenues for further research. Key findings include (a) the necessity for improved methodological support and adherence, (b) better transparency and traceability of knowledge, (c) the necessity for a quantitative framework to assess the viability and success of KBE development and implementation projects, and (d) the opportunity to move towards mass customization approaches through distributed deployment of KBE in the extended enterprise. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Manufacturing principles derived from the car industry have been successfully used to produce attractive, customized and affordable homes. But there are limits to which such techniques can be applied to manage the assembly of wide varieties of component parts needed to produce complex customized products. Managers must trade off the need to achieve economies of scale in the production of standardized factory parts with economies of scope in various stages of assembly in order to provide flexibility to satisfy consumer choices. The housing industries can benefit by learning more about the use of advanced manufacturing techniques developed in car production. At the same time, automobile makers may learn more about the management of customization from the way in which housing firms organize sales, design and final assembly. The paper suggests that wider ranges of choice can be delivered through managing the whole production system, balancing the use of standard components with flexibility in assembly, rather than by solely attempting to optimize control in discrete parts of the system.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002908379

Unfortunately the amount of dedicated literature available to date is quite low and dispersed. This has not promoted the diffusion of KBE in the world of industry and academia, neither has it contributed to enhancing the level of understanding of its technological fundamentals. The scope of this paper is to offer a broad technological review of KBE in the attempt to fill the current information gap. The artificial intelligence roots of KBE are briefly discussed and the main differences and similarities with respect to classical knowledge based systems and modern general purpose CAD systems highlighted. The programming approach, which is a distinctive aspect of state-of-the-art KBE systems, is discussed in detail, to illustrate its effectiveness in capturing and re-using engineering knowledge to automate large portions of the design process. The evolution and trends of KBE systems are investigated and, to conclude, a list of recommendations and expectations for the KBE systems of the future is provided. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to build and sustain their competitive advantage, the knowledge and expertise of an organisation's staff needs to be seen as a critical strategic resource. This paper presents a general overview of knowledge management and discusses the transfer of knowledge and expertise throughout organisations operating on a global scale. A particular emphasis is placed on the importance of global assignments in transferring knowledge and furthermore on the implications for HRM practices to ensure the successful and effective retention of expertise. Practical examples are presented from Robert Bosch AG, a German multinational organisation and its Australian subsidiary. In this paper, the term “expatriate” is used, however the importance of host country nationals as well as third country nationals should not be ignored in the effective transfer of knowledge and the retention of expertise. © 2000, MCB UP Limited",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986081993

Two scenarios were considered; a traditional cast-in-place, reinforced concrete frame and a laminated timber hybrid design, which utilized engineered wood products (cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam). The boundary of the quantitative analysis was cradle-to-construction site gate and encompassed the structural support system and the building enclosure. Floor plans, elevations, material quantities, and structural loads associated with a five-storey concrete-framed building design were obtained from issued-for-construction drawings. A functionally equivalent, laminated timber hybrid design was conceived, based on Canadian Building Code requirements. Design values for locally produced CLT panels were established from in-house material testing. Primary data collected from a pilot-scale manufacturing facility was used to develop the life cycle inventory for CLT, whereas secondary sources were referenced for other construction materials. The TRACI characterization methodology was employed to translate inventory flows into impact indicators. The results indicated that the laminated timber building design offered a lower environmental impact in 10 of 11 assessment categories. The cradle-to-gate process energy was found to be nearly identical in both design scenarios (3.5 GJ/m2), whereas the cumulative embodied energy (feedstock plus process) of construction materials was estimated to be 8.2 and4.6 GJ/m2 for the timber and concrete designs, respectively; which indicated an increased availability of readily accessible potential energy stored within the building materials of the timber alternative. © 2012 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887921198

In this paradigm, the basic unit is a feature and parts are constructed by a sequence of feature attachment operations. The type and number of possible features involved depend upon product type, the application reasoning process and the level of abstraction. Therefore to provide CAD systems with a basic mechanism to define features that fit the enduser needs seems more appropriate than trying to provide a large repertoire of features covering every possible application.A procedural mechanism is proposed for generating and deploying user-defined features in a feature-based design paradigm. The usefulness of the mechanism relies on two functional capabilities. First the shape and size of the user-defined features are instantiated according to parameter values given by the end-user. Second the end-user positions and orients the feature in the part being designed by means of geometric gestures on geometric references. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The paper firstly explains the underlying mechanisms of KBE, and the significant benefits that can be achieved from their application. These are illustrated using industrial examples. The need for a methodology for KBE system development is examined, as are the differing requirements in this respect of small and large organisations. Existing methodologies are discussed, and the aims and approach for a new methodology, specifically aimed at SMEs (small- to medium-sized enterprises - those having less than 250 employees), are outlined. Work on this methodology is underway, involving extensive collaboration with local enterprises. An overall framework for the activities to be performed has been drawn up, and an integrated modelling approach has been devised. The paper ends with a discussion of the ways in which the special needs of SMEs are being fulfilled by the methodology.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034315847

Continuous blood pressure measurements were used as the physiological indicator. Sensory evaluation by the semantic differential (SD) method and the profile of mood states (POMS) test were performed to determine changes in psychological impression. Results showed that visual stimulation from hinoki wall panels had an emotional and natural impression upon humans. Blood pressure decreased significantly in subjects who liked them, and there was no significant increase in blood pressure in subjects who disliked them. Visual stimulation from the white steel wall panel made an unhealthy and closed impression and increased the sense of depression. In addition, there was stress and a significant increase in blood pressure in subjects who disliked them. Consequently, visual stimulation from hinoki and white steel wall panels had different physiological and psychological effects. Results also showed that the same visual stimulation induced different physiological responses depending on the values of the individuals. © The Japan Wood Research Society 2005.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-18444412940

The current sales and design process at a timber volume element prefabricator is presented and evaluated regarding information management and standardisation. It was found that information management during early design is often ad hoc and person dependent; therefore searching for information that could lead to reuse of past solutions is rather time demanding. There is a need for standardisation due to a mentality of designing one-of-a-kind buildings. Knowledge-based engineering is seen as an enabler to enhance the current situation and an IT support procedure is suggested. A demonstrator stair tool was tested, which lets the seller discuss needs with the customer and then use the tool to assess cost and manufacturability. It is argued that the IT support procedure can enable; automation of activities and availability of down stream knowledge in virtual format and a connection between instances of the same geometry. If design flaws can be found early on, downstream waste activities can be reduced. Standardisation could be realised through modularisation, which the implementation of the IT support tool procedure could gain from.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349147098
