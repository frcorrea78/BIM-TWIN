The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242652022

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941085241

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

This paper explores how BIM can be a beneficial platform for supplementing FM practices. An online survey and face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess the current status of BIM implementations in FM, potential applications, and the level of interest in the utilization of BIM.

Connecting real-time data streams from the rapidly expanding set of IoT sensor networks to the high-fidelity BIM models provides numerous applications. However, BIM and IoT integration research are still in nascent stages, there is a need to understand the current situation of BIM and IoT device integration. This paper conducts a comprehensive review with the intent to identify common emerging areas of application and common design patterns in the approach to tackling BIM-IoT device integration along with an examination of current limitations and predictions of future research directions. Altogether, 97 papers from 14 AEC related journals and databases in other industry over the last decade were reviewed. Several prevalent domains of application namely Construction Operation and Monitoring, Health & Safety Management, Construction Logistic & Management, and Facility Management were identified. The authors summarized 5 integration methods with description, examples, and discussion. These integration methods are utilizing BIM tools’ APIs and relational database, transform BIM data into a relational database using new data schema, create new query language, using semantic web technologies and hybrid approach. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and web services-based strategies for BIM and IoT integration, establishing information integration & management standards, solving interoperability issue, and cloud computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060885881

Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University’s city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and challenges of BIM in FM applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931458663

A significant trend is that cyber and physical environments are being unprecedentedly entangled with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has been widely immersed into various domains in the industry. Among those areas where IoT would make significant impacts are building construction, operation, and management by facilitating high-class services, providing efficient functionalities, and moving towards sustainable development goals. So far, IoT itself has entered an ambiguous phase for industrial utilization, and there are limited number of studies focusing on the application of IoT in the building industry. Given the promising future impact of IoT technologies on buildings, and the increasing interests in interdisciplinary research among academics, this paper investigates the state-of-the-art projects and adoptions of IoT for the development of smart buildings within both academia and industry contexts. The wide-ranging IoT concepts are provided, covering the necessary breadth as well as relevant topic depth that directly relates to smart buildings. Current enabling technologies of IoT, especially those applied to buildings and related areas are summarized, which encompasses three different layers based on the conventional IoT architecture. Afterwards, several recent applications of IoT technologies on buildings towards the critical goals of smart buildings are selected and presented. Finally, the priorities and challenges of successful and seamless IoT integration for smart buildings are discussed. Besides, this paper discusses the future research questions to advance the implementation of IoT technologies in both building construction and operation phases. The paper argues that a mature adoption of IoT technologies in the building industry is not yet realized and, therefore, calls for more attention from researchers in the relevant fields from the application perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060881716

By extending the model into the post-occupancy period, BIM models can be used to support Facilities Management and Building Operations, and offer a consolidated interface for information regarding all aspects of building operational performance. Four key challenges must be overcome to develop BIM models suitable for Sustainable Operations management: (1) identification of critical information required to inform Operational decisions, (3) the high level of effort to create new or modify existing BIM models for the building(s), (2) the management of information transfer between real-time operations and monitoring systems and the BIM model, and (4) the handling of uncertainty based on incomplete building documentation. This paper describes the process used to addresses and overcome each of these challenges. The BIM framework and its refinement are presented along with evaluative data from a case study where a model was developed using this framework for a complex university building.

Insights are synthesized from critical review of the literature: key objectives of prototyping, critical review of major techniques, relationships between techniques, and a strategy matrix to connect objectives to techniques. The review is supported with exemplar prototypes provided from industrial design efforts. Techniques are roughly categorized into those that improve the outcomes of prototyping directly, and those that enable prototyping through lowering of cost and time. Compact descriptions of each technique provide a foundation to compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

Participatory action research was used to develop the proof of concept and involved a study of two multi-storey, mixed-use educational buildings (with a contract value worth ≥£150 million UK Sterling) located within Birmingham, UK. The lead researcher worked for the client's estates department and was instrumental in liaising with members of the project management team, synthesising their semantic data requirements and developing the FinDD API plug-in for Autodesk Revit.

Prototypes serve numerous purposes both from a business and an engineering standpoint. Businesses use prototypes to gather detailed customer feedback on issues like aesthetics, ergonomics, and theme, as well as for marketing research and cost analysis. Prototyping is used by engineers to provide manufacturing and assembly data, to investigate system integration issues and to develop analysis and testing strategies. In some cases, prototyping is also used in the concept generation phase of the design process to assist designers to either expand or contract the set of possible concepts. Clearly prototyping is an important part of most design processes. We define the prototyping strategy as the set of decisions that dictate what actions will be taken to accomplish the development of the prototype(s). Prototyping strategies include a variety of different options. In the broadest sense, prototypes can be either physical or virtual. Virtual prototypes can include computer simulations and/or engineering analysis. Physical prototypes can be developed either for a subsystem or for the entire system. In addition, physical prototypes can be either full size or dimensionally scaled and can be either fully functional or be created to exhibit only partial functionality. Additional choices that are part of a prototyping strategy include whether one chooses to develop prototypes for a number of concepts in parallel and whether one plans to develop a sequence of prototypes of a concept. The choices made for the prototyping variables identified above can make tremendous differences in the time frame, cost and effectiveness of the prototyping work. However, very little research has been accomplished to identify how these variables should be chosen for a specific design project. In this paper we document an extensive literature review in the general area of prototyping. Prototyping strategies currently in use by a variety of different product developers are identified. When it is possible to identify either a business or engineering perspective, that perspective is noted. The wide variety of different prototyping strategies currently in use are identified and grouped into categories with similar characteristics. Specific differences in the prototyping strategies for business vs. engineering focused work are noted. Based on the literature review, the current state of the art for prototyping strategies is established. Of particular note is the fact that there is a dearth of information in the literature of how the decisions that determine a prototyping strategy are made. In light of this fact, an additional contribution of this paper is to hypothesize a set of characteristics of a design problem that can be used to optimize prototyping strategies. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029127053

The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028979335

The authors deployed an empirical, inductive research approach to conceptualize Smart Maintenance using focus groups and interviews with more than 110 experts from over 20 different firms. By viewing our original data through the lens of multiple general theories, our findings chart new directions for contemporary and future maintenance research. This paper describes empirical observations and theoretical interpretations cumulating in the first empirically grounded definition of Smart Maintenance and its four underlying dimensions; data-driven decision-making, human capital resource, internal integration, and external integration. In addition, the relationships between the underlying dimensions are specified and the concept structure formally modeled.

Managing the work of FM effectively is extremely difficult owing to the variety of environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of two-dimensional (2D) graphics when depicting facilities. Building information modeling (BIM) uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the facilities depicted in three-dimensional (3D) object-oriented computer-aided design (CAD). This paper proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FM that uses an integrated 2D barcode and the BIM approach. Using 2D barcode and BIM technologies, this study proposes a mobile automated BIM-based facility management (BIMFM) system for FM staff in the operation and maintenance phase. The mobile automated BIMFM system is then applied in a selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FM practice. The combined results demonstrate that a BIMFM-like system can be an effective mobile automated FM tool.

Design educators have, in recent decades, come closer to one another in how they approach design creativity. Still, many distinct differences exist. One of the most striking has to do with the role of prototyping in developing ideas into concrete manifestations. Prototypes unlock cognitive association mechanisms related to visualisation, prior experience, and interpersonal communication in ways that favour iterative learning between peers in the product development community. When, where, and how to use prototyping strategies depends on context, and it demands a high level of situation awareness. The nature of this awareness is, in turn, dependent on cultural variables and curriculum development. Prototyping has been portrayed as an excellent activity to share inner thoughts, yet a deeper connection to its knowledge-building processes has been lacking in previous research. This paper builds on related literature in shaping a common understanding of how prototyping is perceived and applied in two different high-performance academic contexts (Stanford University, Stanford, USA, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). Our exploration focuses on students' perceived learning experiences and on teachers' experiences within engineering design projects. Prototyping is an active enabler in both cases, establishing iterative loops of new knowledge through social interaction and team-based communication. The deeper level of cognitive attachments to prototyping provides an explicit link between embedded implicit knowledge and its consequences for objective learning. © 2013 J.

However, user interaction with connected devices suffers from numerous disadvantages such as complex and cumbersome user interfaces, unreliable voice and gesture interfaces, and the requirement for prior knowledge of the environment. This paper presents an intuitive point-and-click framework to control electrical fixtures in a smart built environment. This functionality is enabled by coupling an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based indoor positioning system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to retrieve contextual information of the user with respect to the built environment when the user performs the pointing action. This information is then input into a building information model (BIM)-based virtual environment wherein the appliance of interest to the user is determined. The subsequent clicking action of the user then turns the devices on or off based on its prior state via the IoT infrastructure in the building. Initial prototype testing through a case study yielded promising results that prove the effectiveness of the framework.

Even though recent research has proposed various methods and performed an increasing number of case studies, there are still issues of communication processes to be addressed. This paper presents a theoretical framework for digital systems integration of virtual models and smart technologies. Based on the comprehensive analysis of existing technologies for indoor localization, a new workflow is defined and designed, and it is utilized in a practical case study to test the model performance. In the new workflow, a facility management supporting platform is proposed and characterized, featuring indoor positioning systems to allow end users to send geo-referenced reports to central virtual models. In addition, system requirements, information technology (IT) architecture and application procedures are presented. Results show that the integration of end users in the maintenance processes through smart and easy tools can overcome the existing limits of barcode systems and building management systems for failure localization. The proposed framework offers several advantages. First, it allows the identification of every element of an asset including wide physical building elements (walls, floors, etc.) without requiring a prior mapping. Second, the entire cycle of maintenance activities is managed through a unique integrated system including the territorial dimension. Third, data are collected in a standard structure for future uses. Furthermore, the integration of the process in a centralized BIM-GIS (geographical information system) information management system admit a scalable representation of the information supporting facility management processes in terms of assets and supply chain management and monitoring from a spatial perspective. © 2018 by the authors.

In existing buildings, however, the cost to replace existing Building Management Systems (BMS) with IoT-compatible devices poses a barrier to adoption. Additionally, the limited data storage on these existing systems further precludes data analytics for optimization. This research responds to this need by presenting a novel approach to pre-process and stream the BMS data to a cloud-based database on a private network. Afterwards, in the centralized data warehouse, larger scale and more complex analytics can be performed. This paper presents the development of both the new database architecture and supporting infrastructure to support the streaming of BMS, as well as the pre-processing to optimize big data analytics and visualization.

This research examines the development of a model-based approach for capturing and handing over facility data. Previously completed research consists of a spread-sheet based documentation method for capturing identified facility-related information to support an owner’s operation and maintenance of educational facilities. An approach was developed and piloted to validate a process that utilized milestone information submissions for documenting appropriate information throughout the design and construction of a facility using a spreadsheet based approach with direct input into the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Using a pilot project approach, this paper builds on the spreadsheet based approach by identifying how the facility information could be captured throughout the project using a model based approach. A six-step systematic process is defined for BIM-FM integration to capture facility data and integrate the information into a CMMS. Various challenges and considerations to capture and deliver facility data are discussed. The paper also discusses the need for further validation of the proposed process and summarises ongoing study to test the proposed approaches using a second pilot project. © 2017 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026328344

In recent years, BIM has been widely used in design and construction phases, but it has not been widely used in operation and maintenance phases, which account for the largest part of the building life cycle. The information required in BIM is different in each of the phases of design, construction, operation, and maintenance, and there are many pieces of reproduced information, making it difficult for managers to utilize the information. Although a number of studies have been conducted on combination of BIM with various technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced sensing equipment in operation and maintenance, and interlinking of the obtained information with BIM information, there have been difficulties in commercialization and field application. This study aims to determine the problems found in previous studies and propose a fusion process in which new technologies adopt and utilize virtual reality techniques such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and head-mounted displays (HMDs) in existing maintenance work, thereby increasing maintenance work efficiency and further improving the utilization of BIM. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

This is a response to the increasingly dynamic use of the campus and the pressure on resources: energy, financial and human resources. The university community has become more mobile, student numbers more unpredictable and funding more uncertain. Consequently, campus strategies focus on resource efficiency and sharing space, requiring investment in management information to improve decision making. The Internet of Things (IoT) can help to provide big data about use patterns: by collecting real-time data on space utilization, users can make better use of current spaces and real estate managers can make better decisions about long-term demand. Furthermore, space utilisation data can be complemented with user feedback data and environmental variables, e.g. noise levels, luminance. In this research we identify the capabilities of existing IoT applications through a literature study. Literature also suggests that information from IoT applications is not utilized in organisational decision-making processes. Through four case studies we analyse these decision-making processes and identify the process-level requirements to make strategic decisions in campus management. Then we show how information from the IoT can be directly connected to these processes, thus providing a valuable addition of real-time data as input. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices offer a vast amount of live data stored in heterogeneous repositories, and hence the need for smart methodologies to facilitate IoT-BIM integration is very crucial. The first step to better integrating IoT and Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be performed by implementing the Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) to combining software and other services by replacing the sematic information that was failed to display elements of indoor conditions. The other development is to create link that able to update static models towards real-time models using SOA approach.

CAFM offers various interfaces to exchange information between different kinds of tools. Various inter-trade organisations and associations have already developed information-exchange procedures. Besides the CAFM-developer, these organisations have defined information-exchange standards to integrate the Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach into FM, e.g. 3D visualization and underlying information concerning buildings and its devices. At this juncture (March 2017) the combination of BIM and FM is not only possible, it is mandatory. It is merely possible to exchange already existing information concerning the buildings. This implicates the acquisition and also adding the exchange of these information through to the chosen CAFM and BIM software tools. According to the fact that already existing information can only be used for the information exchange (and are later usable in FM), it is not possible to represent information which are related close to real-time. “Operating instead of reacting” is often used as a maxim in industry which leads to the integration of BIM and FM. The need of linking real-time data in FM is based on the requirement in the fields of energy management, central building control and safety systems. Via static and mobile sensors, information is collected and sent to CAFM-connectors. Within these connectors, information concerning BIM-linked building parts are transferred to an external database, which offers information management by the building participants, such as the architect, experts, project manager, building coordinator, investor and structural engineer. While using real-time data systems, lifecycle costs will decline while the whole life period of the building will increase, and safety for users will improve. © 2017 WIT Press.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031282342

Many of these developments align with developing new and innovative office-like workplaces. For facility management (FM) professionals, the built workplace is both the key to and the prime focus of their activities. The key to the virtual workplace is that it enables and enhances the mobility of people. Wireless networking is an enabler of many new types of workplace innovation applications. Its key contribution lies in the opportunity to connect all kinds of devices with software applications. Three primary workplace services the facility manager must focus on are space management, service management and maintenance management. Building information modeling (BIM) systems provide a powerful collaborative, virtual modeling environment for the design, construction, and engineering of buildings. New and emerging applications related to intelligent or smart infrastructures include wireless networks consisting of sensors, intelligent meters, and/or switches. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

It uses energy and maintenance management software to frame the discussion. The chapter first discusses some fundamental concepts and definitions, and then provides an overview of the challenges that result when technology, people, and process are not balanced during a technology planning and implementation project. The discussion of current needs is followed by a discussion of what is needed to support emerging technologies. The chapter closes with two case studies that describe the role of people and both project and business processes in technology deployment. The first case study provides an overview of how to use a building automation system (BAS) to benchmark and improve energy efficiency within a lab building. The second case study summarizes the importance of people and organizational roles within a software enterprise system integration project, with an emphasis on lessons learned. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This chapter provides a generic description of asset management and a detailed description of facility asset management and the role played by condition assessment. It provides comparisons of alternative techniques of building condition assessment and presents recommendations to help the reader decide which alternative technique is best for an organization. Computer-based parametric models use inventory data and computed metrics to compute many forms of business intelligence (BI), which can be used by decision makers. The ultimate purpose of condition assessment in facility asset management is to determine the present condition of an organization’s facility assets and to provide data and metrics for use in subsequent process phases of creating and using BI. The successful application of facility asset management depends on the accuracy, granularity, and credibility of facility data available to that organization. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
