Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field.

Such information is however critical to the successful management of construction projects: It supports fundamental activities such as progress tracking and construction dimensional quality control. In this paper, a new approach for automated recognition of project 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model objects in large laser scans is presented, with significant improvements compared to the one originally proposed in Bosché et al. (in press) [11]. A more robust point matching method is used and registration quality is improved with the implementation of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based fine registration step. Once the optimal registration of the project's CAD model with a site scan is obtained, a similar ICP-based registration algorithm is proposed to calculate the as-built poses of the CAD model objects. These as-built poses are then used for automatically controlling the compliance of the project with respect to corresponding dimensional tolerances. Experimental results are presented with data obtained from the erection of an industrial building's steel structure. They demonstrate the performance in real field conditions of the model registration and object recognition algorithms, and show the potential of the proposed approach for as-built dimension calculation and control. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This entails project managers to design, implement, and maintain a systematic approach for construction progress monitoring to promptly identify, process and communicate discrepancies between actual and as-planned performances. To achieve this goal, this research focuses on exploring application of unsorted daily progress photograph logs available on any construction site as a data collection technique. Our approach is based on computing-from the images themselves-the photographer's locations and orientations, along with a sparse 3D geometric representation of the as-built site using daily progress photographs and superimposition of the reconstructed scene over as-planned 4D models. Within such an environment, progress photographs are registered in the virtual as-planned environment and this allows a large unstructured collection of daily construction images to be sorted, interactively browsed and explored. In addition, sparse reconstructed scenes superimposed over 4D models allow site images to be geo-registered with the as-planned components and consequently, location-based image processing technique to be implemented and progress data to be extracted automatically. The results of progress comparison between as-planned and as-built performances are visualized in the D4AR (4D Augmented Reality) environment using a traffic light metaphor.

In addition, privacy issues with personnel tracking often limits the usability of these technologies on construction sites. This paper presents a vision based tracking framework that holds promise to address these limitations. The framework uses videos from a set of two or more static cameras placed on construction sites. In each camera view, the framework identifies and tracks construction entities providing 2D image coordinates across frames. Combining the 2D coordinates based on the installed camera system (the distance between the cameras and the view angles of them), 3D coordinates are calculated at each frame.

In the case of materials such information can only be derived from appearance-based data contained in 2D imagery. Currently, the state-of-the-art texture recognition algorithms which are often used for recognizing materials are very promising (reaching over 95% average accuracy), yet they have mainly been tested in strictly controlled conditions and often do not perform well with images collected from construction sites (dropping to 70% accuracy and lower). In addition, there is no benchmark that validates their performance under real-world construction site conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new vision-based method for material classification from single images taken under unknown viewpoint and site illumination conditions. In the proposed algorithm, material appearance is modeled by a joint probability distribution of responses from a filter bank and principal Hue-Saturation-Value color values and classified using a multiple one-vs.-all χ2 kernel Support Vector Machine classifier. Classification performance is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms both in computer vision and AEC communities. For experimental studies, a new database containing 20 typical construction materials with more than 150 images per category is assembled and used for validation. Overall, for material classification an average accuracy of 97.1% for 200×200 pixel image patches are reported. In cases where image patches are smaller, our method can synthetically generate additional pixels and maintain a competitive accuracy to those reported above (90.8% for 30×30 pixel patches). The results show the promise of the applicability of the proposed method and expose the limitations of the state-of-the-art classification algorithms under real world conditions.

To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes.

Captured videos from construction sites are potential tools to control earthmoving operations; however, the current practice of manual data extraction from surveillance videos is tedious, costly, and error prone. Cutting-edge computer vision techniques have the potential to automate equipment monitoring tasks. This paper presents research in the evaluation of combinations of existing object recognition and background subtraction algorithms to recognize off-highway dump trucks in noisy video streams containing other active machines. Two detection algorithms, namely, Haar-histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and Blob-HOG, are presented and evaluated for their ability to recognize dump trucks in videos as measured by both effectiveness and timeliness. The results of this study can help practitioners select a suitable approach to recognize such equipment in videos for real-time applications such as productivity measurement, performance control, and proactive work-zone safety. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869462297

These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the current state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better.

However, current modeling practices of using energy simulation tools do not model the energy performance of buildings at their element level. As a result, potential retrofit candidates caused by construction defects and degradations are not represented. Furthermore, due to manual modeling and calibration processes, their application is often time-consuming. Current application of 2D thermography for building diagnostics is also facing several challenges due to a large number of unordered and non-geo-tagged images. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new computer vision-based method for automated 3D energy performance modeling of existing buildings using thermal and digital imagery captured by a single thermal camera. First, using a new image-based 3D reconstruction pipeline which consists of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms, the geometrical conditions of an existing building is reconstructed in 3D. Next, a 3D thermal point cloud model of the building is generated by using a new 3D thermal modeling algorithm. This algorithm involves a one-time thermal camera calibration, deriving the relative transformation by forming the Epipolar geometry between thermal and digital images, and the MVS algorithm for dense reconstruction. By automatically superimposing the 3D building and thermal point cloud models, 3D spatio-thermal models are formed, which enable the users to visualize, query, and analyze temperatures at the level of 3D points. The underlying algorithms for generating and visualizing the 3D spatio-thermal models and the 3D-registered digital and thermal images are presented in detail. The proposed method is validated for several interior and exterior locations of a typical residential building and an instructional facility. The experimental results show that inexpensive digital and thermal imagery can be converted into ubiquitous reporters of the actual energy performance of existing buildings. The proposed method expedites the modeling process and has the potential to be used as a rapid and robust building diagnostic tool. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A data set consisting of more than 87million pixels was generated from 108 images of concrete surfaces with a variety of surfaces. Transformations from the RGB color space to non-RGB color spaces were performed to increase separability between concrete and background classes and to achieve robustness to changes in illumination. To find the optimal combination of color space and machine learning algorithm, the performance of three machine learning algorithms (e.g., a Gaussian mixture model, an artificial neural network model, and a support vector machine model) in two non-RGB color spaces (e.g., HSI and normalized RGB) was comparatively analyzed.

Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end, this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps: (1) data capturing and processing, (2) object recognition, and (3) as-is BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed. Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are identified.

Assuming an input of points that can be described by a single non-self-intersecting NURBS, this article presents a new method that leverages segmented point clouds and outputs NURBS surfaces. It starts by successively fitting uniform B-Spline curves in two-dimensional as planar cross-sectional cuts on each surface. An intermediate B-Spline surface is then computed by globally optimizing and lofting over the cross-sections. This surface is used to parameterize the points and perform final refinement to a NURBS. For cylindrical segments such as pipes, a new supervised method is also introduced to string the fitted segments, identify connection types, standardize the connections, and then refine them using NURBS optimization.

Two new developments for as-built BIM modelling are presented in this article. The first is a new library of reusable parametric objects designed for modelling classical architectural elements from survey data. These library objects are dynamic and have parameters that can instantly alter the shape, size and other properties of objects. The parametric architectural objects have been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded programming language within the ArchiCAD BIM software called Geometric Description Language (GDL). The second development which is described in more detail in this article is a complete parametric building façade. This parametric building facade can be used as a template for fast and efficient generation of BIM facade geometry. The design of this parametric façade incorporates concepts from procedural modelling which is an automated approach to generating 3D geometries based on rules and algorithms. Parametric architectural objects are automatically combined with rules to generate many different façade arrangements which are controlled by user parameters. When automatically generating a façade, the initial position and size of elements are estimated using classical architectural proportions. Object can then be graphically edited individually or in groups to match the computer generated geometry to survey data. The parametric façade template has also been implemented with the Geometric Description Language for ArchiCAD BIM software. This enables the tools developed to utilise the full benefits of BIM software which includes automated construction or conservation documents, semantic object oriented objects based on IFC semantic classes, automatic lists of objects and material and the ability to add and link additional information to the model. Initial user tests have indicated that the parametric façade is more efficient than previous methods for creating accurate façade models from survey data. The façade template also provides an easier solution for generating façade models when compared to existing methods. Non-specialist users with little experience in 3D modelling can easily generate and modify the façade template by altering parameters graphically or from a dialogue box. © 2014 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894458566

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s.

Recently, several data mining techniques have been used as a way to solve the problem of detecting construction materials. These studies have applied single classifiers to detect construction materials - and distinguish them from the background - by using color as a feature. Recent studies suggest that combining multiple classifiers (into what is called a heterogeneous ensemble classifier) would show better performance than using a single classifier. However, the performance of ensemble classifiers in construction material detection is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the performance of six single classifiers and potential ensemble classifiers on three data sets: one each for concrete, steel, and wood. A heterogeneous voting-based ensemble classifier was created by selecting base classifiers which are diverse and accurate; their prediction probabilities for each target class were averaged to yield a final decision for that class. In comparison with the single classifiers, the ensemble classifiers performed better in the three data sets overall.

Such approaches easily overwhelmed the users' memory capability and thus caused low reusability of CAD documents. In this paper, a content-based text mining technique is adopted to extract the textual content of a CAD document into a characteristic document (CD), which can be retrieved with similarity matching using a Vector Space Model (VSM), so that the automated and expedited retrievals of CAD documents from vast CAD databases become possible.

As a result, users have to define appropriate ones by themselves, which is difficult for those who do not have enough image processing background. This paper presents a novel method of identifying concrete material regions using machine learning techniques. Under the method, each construction site image is first divided into regions through image segmentation. Then, the visual features of each region are calculated and classified with a pre-trained classifier. The output value determines whether the region is composed of concrete or not. The method was implemented using C++ and tested over hundreds of construction site images. The results were compared with the manual classification ones to indicate the method's validity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956610448

However, a crucial challenge occurs in existing systems when semantic building information is captured under uncontrolled environmental conditions, especially in complex environments with poorly textured features (e.g., no obvious characteristics, edges, points, or lines). This study presents a semiautomatic image-driven system to recognize building objects and their materials and reviews the state-of-the-art object and material recognition methods and systems. A novel semiautomatic image-driven system was developed according to the new neuro-fuzzy framework for recognition of building objects and based on material classification procedures supported by an extensible texture library constructed to recognize their surface materials. More than 600 images were collected for the training process to develop this system, and more than 200 images were used for system verification. The results of the verification experiments show that the developed system can successfully recognize five kinds of building objects (i.e., beams, columns, windows, doors, and walls) and their corresponding surface materials from a single image taken by a handheld digital camera. Furthermore, the recognized building objects are automatically represented in industry foundation classes (IFC), a standard data schema for BIMs. The developed system is highly accurate, robust, and time-efficient for constructing as-is BIM objects in IFC and can help both BIM researchers and practitioners to develop information-rich BIMs in the O&M phase. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053428303

Failure in effectively tracking components/materials and in accessing the related information on demand results in schedule delays and additional labor costs. Due to long read ranges, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology holds the potential for enabling automated tracking of components/materials in dynamic and uncontrolled environments. Also, on-board storage capacity of RFID allows for making information related to a component of a bulk of material readily available to the persons who are handling components and materials. This paper provides an overview of possible applications for RFID use and describes the field tests conducted in several research studies on utilization of RFID in construction industry. The field tests described were performed for tracking pipe spools and precast components during delivery and receipt, tracking precast components in a manufacturer's storage yard, tracking tools, locating materials and transferring material information to construction site. The results of those tests demonstrated that despite some limitations of the current technology, active UHF RFID meets the needs for the selected cases provided that some reasoning mechanisms are developed and implemented for data cleaning and processing purposes.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949101732

Virtual cities, for example, is one of the exciting application fields of ORR which became very popular during the last decade. Natural and man-made objects of cities such as trees and buildings are complex structures and automatic recognition and reconstruction of these objects from digital aerial images but also other data sources is a big challenge. In this paper a novel approach for object recognition is presented based on neuro-fuzzy modelling. Structural, textural and spectral information is extracted and integrated in a fuzzy reasoning process. The learning capability of neural networks is introduced to the fuzzy recognition process by taking adaptable parameter sets into account which leads to the neuro-fuzzy approach. Object reconstruction follows recognition seamlessly by using the recognition output and the descriptors which have been extracted for recognition. A first successful application of this new ORR approach is demonstrated for the three object classes 'buildings', 'cars' and 'trees' by using aerial colour images of an urban area of the town of Engen in Germany. © 2005 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This method involves the detection of walls and joint points amid walls and openings, and the search of intersection points amid walls. To give support to the wall detection process, this paper introduces the wall adjacency graph (WAG), a data structure created to detect walls from sets of planar segments contained in architectural floor plans. Wall adjacency graphs allow us to obtain a consistent and exhaustive set of walls very quickly (less than one second for real floor plans). A generalized version of the wall adjacency graph is also presented to deal with some of the limitations of the initial WAG. Algorithms for the detection of joint points and wall intersection points are presented as well, based on the analysis of the geometry from the input CAD drawings. Moreover, all this process works appropriately with both straight and circular segments. The obtained floor topology can later be used as input to generate 3D models of buildings, which are widely used on virtual cities, BIM systems and GIS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This identification facilitates the annotation of any visual object to a building's façade and is an essential step in a variety of applications, such as automatic target detection in surveillance, real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, and 3D city reconstruction. Because of its importance, a significant number of building recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no systematic survey of building recognition in urban environments yet. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of the dominant building recognition systems by first grouping them into two categories: (i) effectiveness approaches that mainly focus on the improvement of recognition performance and (ii) efficiency methods that attempt to enhance the recognition speed. Effectiveness approaches are further categorized into two different groups: (i) feature representation-based algorithms and (ii) wide baseline matching-based methods. Efficiency methods are divided into: (i) dimensionality reduction-based methods and (ii) clustering-based algorithms. We provide analysis and discussions on each type of method and summarize their advantages and weaknesses in depth. Furthermore, we outline future research directions and associated challenges in this promising area.

First, in order to represent the structure of symbols more clearly and simply, we involve the text entity as one of the basic elements and redefine the relation representation mechanism, which is the foundation for the following algorithms. Then, the structure graph and a constrained tree can be established automatically for the target symbol, using the knowledge acquisition algorithm. In this process, the highest priority element is considered as the key feature, which will be regarded as the root node of the tree. The sequence of breadth first traveling will be recorded to be the recognition rule and saved in the symbol library. In the recognition process, the nodes with the same type as the key features can be located first in the drawing. Unnecessary matching calculations would be greatly reduced because of the accurate location. The other elements around, which satisfy the topology structure of the constrained tree, will be found next. The target symbol is recognized if all of the elements and constraints in the tree are found. Moreover, an extra preprocessing analysis approach is proposed to address repeat modes in a symbol. Thus, similar symbols can be recognized by one rule. We evaluate the proposed approach on the GREC databases and the real engineering drawings. The experimental results validate its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865592646

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect head contours, which includes three main steps: pre-processing, head contour detection and post-processing. Hough circle transform is adopted in the second stage, which is robust to discontinuous boundaries in circle detection.

After defining the processes of the conventional and TLS-based approaches, data from a case study are collected and processed in both project and company levels. Through analysis and discussion of the result, it is demonstrated that the TLS-based approaches are more time-efficient and cost-beneficial in the long term.

Previous studies have described that Building Information Models (BIM), if available with detailed asset information and their properties, can enable rapid troubleshooting and execution of O&M tasks by providing the required information of the facility. Despite the potential benefits, there is still rarely BIM with Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) assets and properties that are available for O&M. BIM is usually not in possession for existing buildings and generating BIM manually is a time-consuming process. Hence, there is a need for an automated approach that can reconstruct the MEP systems in BIM. Previous studies investigated automatic reconstruction of BIM using architectural drawings, structural drawings, or the combination with photos. But most of the previous studies are limited to reconstruct the architectural and structural components. Note that mechanical components in the building typically require more frequent maintenance than architectural or structural components. However, the building mechanical drawings are relatively more complex due to various type of symbols that are used to represent the mechanical systems. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposed a symbol recognition framework that can automatically recognize the different type of symbols in the building mechanical drawings. This study applied vector-based computer vision techniques to recognize the symbols and their properties (e.g., location, type, etc.) in two vector-based input documents: 2D drawings and the symbol description document. The framework not only enables recognizing and locating the mechanical component of interest for BIM reconstruction purpose but opens the possibility of merging the updated information into the current BIM in the future reducing the time of repeated manual creation of BIM after every renovation project. © 2019 Techno-Press, Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067961251
