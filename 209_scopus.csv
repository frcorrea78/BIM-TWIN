Document management collaboration systems (e.g. Extranets) have significantly improved the document collaboration in recent years; however their capabilities for model collaboration are limited and do not support the complex requirements of BIM collaboration. The construction industry is responding to this situation by adopting emerging model collaboration systems (MCS), such as model servers, with the ability to exploit and reuse information directly from the models to extend the current intra-disciplinary collaboration towards integrated multi-disciplinary collaboration on models. The functions of existing MCSs have evolved from the manufacturing industry and there is no concrete study on how these functions correspond to the requirements of the construction industry, especially with BIM requirements. This research has conducted focus group sessions with major industry disciplines to explore the user requirements for BIM collaboration. The research results have been used to categorise and express the features of existing MCS which are then analysed in selected MCS from a user's perspective. The potential of MCS and the match or gap in user requirements and available model collaboration features is discussed. This study concludes that model collaborative solutions for construction industry users are available in different capacities; however a comprehensive custom built solution is yet to be realized.

This paper proposes a novel approach to designing RE visual notations that actively involves naïve users in the process. We use i*, one of the most influential RE notations, to demonstrate the approach, but the same approach could be applied to any RE notation. We present the results of 5 related empirical studies that show that novices outperform experts in designing symbols that are comprehensible to novices: the differences are both statistically significant and practically meaningful. Symbols designed by novices increased semantic transparency (their ability to be spontaneously interpreted by other novices) by almost 300% compared to the existing i* notation. The results challenge the conventional wisdom about visual notation design: that it should be conducted by a small group of experts; our research suggests that it should instead be conducted by large numbers of novices. The approach is consistent with Web 2.0, in that it harnesses the collective intelligence of end users and actively involves them in the notation design process as 'prosumers' rather than passive consumers. We believe this approach has the potential to radically change the way visual notations are designed in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891106807

Data are often sensitive and embody rights, ownership, and intellectual property of the creator. Managing project information raises concerns about security, inconsistency, and loss of data. Conventional approach of dealing with the complexities of data management involves the adoption of BIM-based solutions that lack suitable means for the governance of collaboration, and access and archival of managed data. To overcome the limitations of BIM, cloud-based governance solutions have been suggested as a way forward. However, there is a lack of understanding of construction Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practices from the perspectives of data management and governance. This paper aims to fill this gap: first, by exploring barriers related to BIM adoption and collaboration practices, in particular, issues related to data management and governance that can potentially be ameliorated with cloud technologies, and second, by identifying key requirements for cloud-based BIM governance solutions. A structured questionnaire was conducted among informed construction practitioners in this study. The findings reveal several barriers to BIM adoption alongside ICT and collaboration issues with an urgent need to develop a BIM governance solution underpinned by cloud technology. Further, a number of important requirements for developing BIM governance solutions have been identified. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969895461

This will enable improvements in progress monitoring, construction process control, as-built documentation and sustainable building practices. To maintain bi-directional coordination, computational resources are required to tightly integrate the virtual models and the physical construction such that changes in one environment are automatically reflected in the other.

The lack of a suitable means for the governance of collaboration and for the access and archival of data has been cited as the key barrier for the widespread adoption of collaborative BIM environments.

We executed a controlled experiment with post-graduate students. The experimental task was to elicit requirements using open interview and consolidate the elicited information immediately afterwards. We used four different problem domains about which students had different levels of knowledge. Two tasks were used in the experiment, whereas the other two were used in an internal replication of the experiment; that is, we repeated the experiment with the same subjects but with different domains.

Although this problem could be alleviated by information systems similar to those in other industries, companies struggle to model processes and information needs in the manner necessary to develop information systems that support digital collaboration, workflows, and information exchange. Processes for information systems can be described from four perspectives: task sequence, information need, organizational interaction, and required logic for the specific task. Traditional business process modeling languages often fail to completely cover all four perspectives. BuildingSMART has proposed Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs) to model and re-engineer processes that address the four perspectives through a collaborative methodology in order to standardize and implement them in information systems. BIM implies that objects are bearers of information and logic. The present study has three main aims: (1) to explore IDMs capability to capture all four perspectives, (2) to determine whether an IDM's collaborative methodology is valid for developing standardized processes, and (3) to ascertain whether IDM's business rules can support the development of information and logic-bearing BIM objects. The research is based on a case study of re-engineering the bidding process for a design-build project to integrate building product manufacturers, subcontractors and their knowledge about costs, construction methods, and products, with the intention of minimizing the time spent on non-value-adding tasks and reducing design errors.

In a nutshell, BIM could be understood as a set of new processes to design, plan, and construct buildings, based on 3D virtual objects that represent different building components, and its mutual relationships. Nowadays, most applications of BIM processes are focused on the concept, design, and planning phases of the building lifecycle. Part of the reason behind that fact is that construction processes are still largely dependent of human labor, and dynamic connection between BIM models and real progression on-site during construction phase are almost non-existent. In exploiting the digitization promoted by the introduction of BIM, it should be important to consider the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies to Construction. This papers presents a framework in which Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Construction are based on virtual models of construction processes, implemented via Petri Nets, and connected to both BIM models, and to hardware (sensors and actuators) working in on-site production / assembly. Then, the proposed framework is 'relaxed' and extended to be applied in a scenario where CPS are just a bi-directional link between virtual models and its real counterparts on-site, without hardware to be controlled, but with observations based on data acquired via sensing. Such proposition aims to concentrate efforts and promote the importance of process models in construction, and to provide simulation and optimization to the current processes based on data from real-time progression monitoring during construction and information from BIM models. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050086806

It establishes that ‘dimension’ is often used metaphorically to indicate information-processing capacities – an unfortunate usage in an area where the term is used literally. The paper proposes that a dimension in symbolic building representations should be a primary property of a symbol, not derivative, and moreover essential for the identity of the symbolized object, i.e. not subject to abstraction. On the basis of these principles, it is reasoned that BIM can only be 4D. © 2020 The Author",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081007456

In BIM processes, it is necessary to identify and exchange the specific information that is relevant in the exchange information requirements of each project. The concept of level of detail of the information is a tool for describing and quantifying the information that should be exchanged. But the existing definitions of level of detail of information are not easily usable. Precise definitions of methodology, tools and principles are needed to redefine this concept and to use it in order to define the elements of information that are relevant to be exchanged. Methods: The authors propose the use of System Engineering and Requirements Engineering to define BIM uses and the relevant level of detail of information and its modelling concerned by each BIM use. The authors first explain why, in this context, the existing definitions of LOD, which can mean level of detail, level of development, level of definition, etc., are not sufficient and not always coherent. They demonstrate through real use cases that System Engineering and Requirement Engineering are a part of this methodology and propose, using formalisms, to describe each BIM use in detail. Results: The authors apply two different approaches to defining the relevant information to each BIM use. Using a top-down conceptual approach they show that Level Of Detail (LOD) is a crucial element in defining the content of a BIM use. They then verify the practicality of their proposal using a bottom-up approach based on three use cases (acoustic studies, safety audit, sizing drainage system). These cases studies allow the authors to address different kinds of systems and objects within a whole infrastructure project. They represent domain use cases (acoustic and drainage) and coordination use cases (safety audit). This part of the work is based on the L2 project in Marseille, which is a Public Private Partnership for expressways. As a result, a methodology is proposed both to redefine the level of detail of information concept and to describe how this concept is used to complete the BIM uses definition. The system engineering and requirement engineering methods are partially adapted to infrastructure projects. These elements facilitate the description of BIM uses expected in BIM Execution Plans. It was necessary to change the definitions of LOD in order to make them compatible with the methods of requirement management. Conclusions: Design activities should be reorganized toward the common goal of meeting project needs and requirements. The authors demonstrate that the best way to meet requirements is to define BIM uses using a new definition of the level of detail of information. It has first to consider requirements that have to be reached through BIM and then define the relevant level of detail of information, using the concept of abstraction of reality. To do it well, applying system engineering and requirement engineering, adapted to infrastructure project, is required. To validate this proposal on an entire project, more use cases will be tested in further work. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044729003

Results show that Perceived Usefulness (PU) is the most important determinant of Behavioural Intention (BI), while Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) is found to have no significant effect on BI. The findings provide an excellent backdrop in the development of policy and a roadmap for BIM implementation in Peru.

Natural language processing techniques have been applied to aid in this transformation. Semantic parsing, for instance, adds semantic structure to text. It however requires supporting corpora which are still missing in requirements engineering. To address this gap, we developed FN-RE, a corpus of requirements documents, which was annotated based on semantic frames in FrameNet. Each requirement statement was manually labelled by two annotators by selecting suitable semantic frames and related frame elements. We obtained an average agreement of 72.85% between the two annotators, measured by F-score, thus indicating that the annotations provided in our corpus are reliable. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056877606

The first problem is the common differentiation between 'functional' and 'non-functional' requirements, which hides relevant sustainability requirements and hampers their identification. The second problem is the lack of developer-oriented representation approaches to ensure that all requirements relevant to sustainable software will be finally implemented. To address these two issues ShapeRE provides an alternative multi-dimensional approach for identifying requirements and a developer-oriented representation guideline. We suggest nine dimensions which are social, economic, environmental, technical, individual, purpose, design-Aesthetics, integrative and legal. The design of our frame-work relies on insights from the fields of linguistics and empirical aesthetics, requirements engineering, and building architecture. We introduce the framework and discuss our evaluation strategy consisting of an online-experiment, a case study, and a survey. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093929853

A series of semi-structured interviews with practicing architects was therefore conducted to collect information regarding 1) the design activities that architects actually do in the early stages of the design process, 2) how indoor climate and energy performance is considered during this phase, and 3) to get suggestions from practitioners on how BPS tools could be conformed to fit design practice. The interviewees found it difficult to generalise the course of the design process; it was considered to be different from project to project. However, analysis of interview data led to the contribution of this paper: A theory suggesting that the design process can be described as a project-specific and/or personalized sequence of independent and generalizable design activities. Consequently, the answer to the research question is that tools should support design activities; analysing the interview data, we identified 31 unique design activities. The interviews also revealed a range of desirable traits of an ‘architect-friendly’ BPS tool. This, together with the realisation that BPS tools should support design activities, led the formulation of a set of requirements for the development of BPS tools conformed to fit architectural design practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083437239

We conducted a qualitative study, using interviews and mockups, with fifteen industrial practitioners from four aeronautics companies, in order to investigate what tasks are actually performed by requirements engineers and how current tools support these tasks. We found that RE-specific tools constrain engineers to a rigid workflow, which is conflicting with the adaptive exploration of the problem. Engineers often start by using general-purpose tools to foster exploration and collaborative work with suppliers, at the expense of traceability. When engineers shift to requirements refinement and verification, they must use RE-specific tools to grant traceability. Then, the lack of tool usability yields significant time loss and dissatisfaction. Based on scenarios of observed RE practices and walkthrough, we formulate usability insights for RE-specific tools in order to conciliate flexibility and traceability throughout the RE process. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032798892

However, traditional zoom+scroll navigation uses a single focus zoom, i.e., at a given point in time, a user can zoom in on a single spot in the model only. Therefore, new focus+context navigation techniques have been proposed that allow multiple foci at the same time. In this paper, we report on an experiment with students where we compare the participants' performance when using a requirements modeling tool with traditional zoom+scroll navigation vs. one with so-called FlexiView navigation which is a focus+context technique with multiple foci. The participants had to perform typical modeling tasks such as searching, editing, and traversing a model. All tasks were performed on medium-sized tablets with a tool for manipulating so-called ImitGraphs. ImitGraphs are enriched node-and-edge diagrams that can mimic various diagram types such as class, activity, or goal decomposition diagrams. We found that navigation with FlexiView outperformed zoom+scroll navigation with respect to task completion time, number of mistakes, cognitive load, and user satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056817479
