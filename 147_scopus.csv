Intelligence comes from data. Integrated analysis for the manufacturing big data is beneficial to all aspects of manufacturing. Besides, the digital twin paves a way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing, which is an important bottleneck to achieve smart manufacturing. In this paper, the big data and digital twin in manufacturing are reviewed, including their concept as well as their applications in product design, production planning, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance. On this basis, the similarities and differences between big data and digital twin are compared from the general and data perspectives. Since the big data and digital twin can be complementary, how they can be integrated to promote smart manufacturing are discussed. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041173790

These advanced methods are required for engineering processes of smart systems and individualized products with high complexity and variability. Emphasis is put on challenges of the life-cycle oriented information integration of products and the respective Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). Furthermore, the chapter addresses data and information management problems coming from integration of the use and operation phase of products and systems in terms of forward and backward information flows. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045069605
