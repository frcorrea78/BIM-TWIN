While BIM adoption is growing, it can be witnessed that adoption is relatively weak within operational and maintenance (O&M) organisations such as Estate and Infrastructure Management, who would ultimately gain the highest value from utilising BIM. While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems. There is a clear gap of knowledge on how to structure a BIM model that allows its efficient use in the O&M phase. Furthermore, there is a lack of claritiy on how to exchange information from a BIM model into an Asset Information Model (AIM). This paper outlines a methodology that enables extraction of BIM-related data directly from a model into a relational database for integration with existing asset management systems. The paper describes the BIM model requirements, development of the extraction platform, database architecture and framework. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. The case study demonstrates that if the BIM model is designed from the start with consideration for the O&M requirements, it can be exploited for development into an AIM. It also shows that a structured approach to object classification within a BIM model supports the efficient exchange of data directly from the BIM model. © 2019 The Authors",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070275875

There is, however, little knowledge available on how 4D BIM tools can best be used during the procurement phase to support the development of more effective risk mitigation strategies. An in-depth qualitative case-study was conducted to understand how the use of 4D BIM tools could support the process of risk mitigation. The case-study was the procurement phase of a billion-euro canal lock expansion project in The Netherlands, where each of the competing contractors made use of 4D BIM tools to mitigate planning risks. The findings show how the use of 4D BIM tools could greatly support the development of highly effective risk mitigation strategies. This study extends 4D BIM literature by presenting empirical evidence on the use of 4D BIM tools during the procurement phase of a complex infrastructure project. © 2019",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067585704

The potential exists to achieve a synergistic relationship between BIM and energy simulation software programs by leveraging information stored within BIM models to inform energy models to save time and improve a design’s performance. This study seeks to understand the perceptions of green design stakeholders with regard to the value of BIM-based energy simulation as well as associated barriers and benefits. To do so, an e-survey was used to collect data. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results suggest that little to no correlation exists between green design stakeholders’ perceptions regarding the value of using information from BIMs to inform energy simulation, and their engagement level with BIM and/or energy simulation. While this study has been limited by its sample size and location of participants, the results help identify different user groups’ perceptions and receptiveness to using BIM-based energy simulation tools, which are advancing and transforming the AEC industry. Studies, such as this, emphasize the need for further research on understanding the modeling processes related to energy simulation and BIM models. © 2019, College Publishing.

The detection system is heavily improved from our previous work, with the following two main contributions: (i) a new refinement algorithm to provide a better detection rate and identification performance with comparable computational resources and (ii) a new plane estimation, filtering and projection step to leverage the BIM information earlier for lamps that are both hanging and embedded. The two modifications are thoroughly tested in five different case studies, yielding better results in terms of detection, identification and localization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067798630
