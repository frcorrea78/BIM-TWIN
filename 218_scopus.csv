Modern camera equipped unmanned aircraft systems are used to generate high-resolution digital image data of the structural surface. The flight path is automatically computed from a basic 3D model and ensures that the image set will satisfy defined quality parameters according to the desired information extraction. State-of-the-art photogrammetry and machine learning based feature detection methods are employed to automatically compute high-resolution geo-referenced 3D structural geometries and to identify typical damage patterns such as cracks. Further framework components dedicated to condition assessment allow the mapping of damages to structural parts and the calibration of mechanical numerical simulation models used to compute the internal structural demand under design loads. Data models are proposed that allow a consistent data storage and management to serve as a basis for all algorithmic components. The application of the framework to a large bridge structure showcases how the integration of digital systems and algorithms forms the basis for an intelligent and potentially autonomous safety assessment of very large infrastructures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056178604

Yet, there is no unified definition of the term. Based on a literature study and an industrial case study, an overarching definition of Digital twins is presented. Three characteristics were identified - representation of a physical system, bidirectional data exchange, and the connection along the entire lifecycle. Further, three sub-concepts are presented, namely: Engineering Twin, Production Twin, and Operation Twin. The presented paper thus formulates a consistent and detailed definition of Digital Twins. © The Author(s), 2020.

Cyclic inspections by hand according to DIN 1076 are the basis for planning maintenance and repair measures for our engineering structures. The calculation of condition ratings is performed based on detected deficiencies. The documentation of the inspection is done primarily within the program system SIB-BW. The system offers a comparably uniform rating standard and enables a limited retrospective and prospective view for maintenance planning. New developments like BIM or continuous, sensor-based monitoring, which is established in other branches, are not yet conceptually integrated. In light of the digital transformation the question arises how the well established manual and the digital assessment as well as BIM generated data can be unified within one continuous process chain and which benefits can by created by doing so. Therefore, the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) has initiated the “smartBridge Hamburg” project which prototypically tests the concept of the digital twin using the Koehlbrandbruecke in Hamburg. The digital twin is used to conceptually unify the BI-model as well as analogue and electronic assessment data and to provide aggregated data in a form that meets the needs of different user groups. This paper presents premises and basic considerations prior to project initiation. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086148171

In this paper, the nonlinear or rather transient relationship between the air temperature and the building temperature is simulated by a machine learning model. Based on this modelling, different use cases for the application of machine learning regression methods to monitoring data are presented, which resulted from practical questions. Basic knowledge of neural networks will be given and for the calculations, long-term monitoring data of valley bridges from VDE 8 are used. It is shown, for example, that these methods can be used to detect and compensate measurement errors or to predict the behaviour of structures. The results show that these methods, have a great potential for the evaluation of large amounts of data since no physical models are required. The paper focuses more on the application of AI methods rather than on the mathematical or theoretical background of the methods. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn.

Digitalization is one of the most important change processes in this century and affects all areas of our society. In the field of civil engineering, digitalization offers many potentials for all phases of the life cycle of structures, which can be expanded by making data available and defining new ways of working with them. Digital methods, in particular building information modeling (BIM) and structural health monitoring (SHM), offer excellent approaches to satisfy this idea, especially for infrastructure engineering structures and can contribute to make the structure operation more efficient. The process of inspection of infrastructure structures follows fixed deadlines. With the help of the presented concept a digitally supported maintenance of railway bridges shall be developed by the interlocking of BIM and SHM in order to enable a predictive maintenance management and thus to improve the reliability of engineering structures over the lifetime. Within the framework of concept development, the required methods and processes are defined, explained and harmonized. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn.
