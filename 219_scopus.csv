Probability, statistics and decision for civil engineers. New York: McGaw Hill) and previous works by the authors it is demonstrated how condition indicators may be formulated for the general purpose of quality control and for assessment and inspection planning in particular. The formulation facilitates quality control based on sampling of indirect information about the condition of the considered components. This allows for a Bayesian formulation of the indicators whereby the experience and expertise of the inspection personnel may be fully utilized and consistently updated as frequentistic information is collected. The approach is illustrated on an example considering a concrete structure subject to corrosion. It is shown how half-cell potential measurements may be utilized to update the probability of excessive repair after 50 years. Furthermore in the same example it is shown how the concept of condition indicators might be applied to develop a cost optimal maintenance strategy composed of preventive and corrective repair measures. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036303086

This paper considers the application of BrIM for the proposed rehabilitation of a heritage listed viaduct. The structure under consideration is the landmark Chetwynd viaduct in Cork (Ireland), which formed part of the Cork-Bandon railway infrastructure constructed in 1851 and decommissioned in 1961. As with infrastructure of its type, few as-built records exist. Consequently, the geometry, material properties and condition of the existing structure are required to inform the initial feasibility assessment and subsequent design, construction and operation of this viaduct asset. Respective BrIM and traditional approaches to the data capture phase are outlined and compared in terms of time, expertise and deliverables. The significant deliverables from the traditional approach include a three-dimensional (3D) solid model and independent 2D drawings. Significant deliverables achieved using a BrIM approach include an intelligent parametric 3D model and associated 2D drawings, as well as integrated datasets representative of the 'as-is' structure. Based on reported research, the initial effort and time expended on model creation in particular will enable significant future benefits. © 2016 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038376198

However, for the most of bridges’ service life, these concerns are addressed indirectly by a qualitative measure, defined herein as condition rating, which is based upon observable damages recorded during inspections. Condition rating is at best, only loosely correlated to safety and serviceability. It would be more reasonable to address safety and serviceability in an inspection process directly, using the information on bridge performance obtained during the design and construction. To address this issue, the reliability was chosen as a Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for existing bridges and a novel practical solution is proposed. It is based on survey of observation types (visible defects, measurements, etc.) used in Europe, which were examined with regard to their potential impact on reliability regarding safety and serviceability. The impact of these observations on reliability is also dependent on their type, location and intensity/extent as well as on bridge structural systems. The paper presents a methodology to assess reliability, which heavily relies on data from design and construction phase. It also proposes a set of data elaborated in design and/or construction phase that need to enter current bridge data bases to allow a rough reliability assessment of existing bridges. © 2019 IABSE.

Defects and/or damage are treated using a population perspective with a probabilistic formulation of the evolution of the number of defects and the extent of deterioration rather than the modelling of individual defects. Measurement errors associated with inspection such as detectability, false calls, and sizing errors are considered to relate the observed to the actual state of structural deterioration. The population-based deterioration model is embedded in a Bayesian pre-posterior analysis to assess the value of information that is achieved by performing an inspection. Applications include the inspection planning of critical components of structural systems such as bridges, tunnels, pipelines, and offshore structures. The proposed analysis is illustrated using a numerical example where the long-term cost benefit of implementing an inspection scheme is determined. © 2019 IABSE.
