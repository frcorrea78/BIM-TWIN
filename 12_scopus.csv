The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the ""smart city"" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the ""smart city."" We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. © 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051636492

However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892634029

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed.

Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by doing so, to begin replacing the currently abstract image of what it means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of smart cities into two large sections - urban futures and the knowledge and innovation economy. The urban futures strand shows that technology has always played an important role in forward-looking visions about the city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the identification of the underlying - and often forgotten - principles of what it means to be 'smart' in an urban context and yields conclusions about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939416880

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems.

Two experiments are described that examine age differences in gap selection decisions in a simulated road-crossing environment. Three groups of participants were tested, younger (30-45 years), young-old (60-69 years) and old-old (>75 years). The results showed that, for all age groups, gap selection was primarily based on vehicle distance and less so on time-of-arrival. Despite the apparent ability to process the distance and speed of oncoming traffic when given enough time to do so, many of the old-old adults appeared to select insufficiently large gaps. These results are discussed in terms of age-related physical, perceptual and cognitive limitations and the ability to compensate for these limitations.

Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-Time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042200986

Previously, much of the focus has been on the characteristics of the urban green space that are likely to influence its use, such as its accessibility, quality, facilities, attractiveness, and security. This assumes a causal relationship, when in reality the relationship is more complex and multifactorial. It is more likely that it is the functionality of the green space, be it for exercise or sociocultural activities, rather than its character, which translates to the reported benefits.

'Digital Twins' in engineering provide a conceptual framework to analyze these emerging data-driven health care practices, as well as their conceptual and ethical implications for therapy, preventative care and human enhancement. Digital Twins stand for a specific engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the concept of 'normality' or 'health,' as a set of patterns that are regular for a particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the 'asymptomatic ill' and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data privacy. © 2018 Bruynseels, Santoni de Sio and van den Hoven.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042098524

One is based on the artificial neural networks approach, while the other two are based on the Mamdani and the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic approaches, respectively. All of them are parameterised with reference to flood events alone, where water levels are higher than a selected threshold. The analysis of the three models is performed by using the same input and output variables. However, in order to evaluate their capability to deal with different levels of information, two different input sets are considered. The former is characterized by significant spatial and time aggregated rainfall information, while the latter considers rainfall information more distributed in space and time. The analysis is made with great attention to the reliability and accuracy of each model, with reference to the Reno river at Casalecchio di Reno (Bologna, Italy). It is shown that the two models based on the fuzzy logic approaches perform better when the physical phenomena considered are synthesised by both a limited number of variables and IF-THEN logic statements, while the ANN approach increases its performance when more detailed information is used. As regards the reliability aspect, it is shown that the models based on the fuzzy logic approaches may fail unexpectedly to forecast the water levels, in the sense that in the testing phase, some input combinations are not recognised by the rule system and thus no forecasting is performed. This problem does not occur in the ANN approach. © 2006 Author(s). This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33344463490

It's a urban area that utilize various devices connected with internet and integrates them with ICTs to promote goodness and execution of services for the best interaction among citizens and city's government. The basic for smart cities is distributed and independent information infrastructure. Using information effectively is going to be a main factor for success in the smart cities. The sources of information's (models, experts, and sensors) must be reason, perfect and complete. The generated information from independent and distributed sources can be imprecise, uncertain, and/or incomplete in real life. Any deficiency in gathered information will have a negative effect on the performance of services and decision making process within smart cities. So, we need a general framework to represent all types of imperfect and incomplete information. Since the classical methods fails to deal with vague, inconsistent and incomplete information, the fuzzy set was introduced to solve this drawback. The fuzzy set was not the perfect method for dealing with these drawbacks because it considers only truthiness and fails to deal with indeterminacy. The efficient mathematical tool for dealing with uncertain, vague and inconsistent objects is rough sets theory which introduced by Pawlak. The theory of neutrosophic rough sets is powerful for dealing with incompleteness and neutrosophic set deals with indeterminate and inconsistent data efficiently through considering truthiness, indeterminacy and falsity degrees. So, in this research we will propose a general framework for dealing with imperfect and incomplete information through using single valued neutrosophic and rough set theories. The combination of two sets will deal with all aspects of vagueness, inconsistency and incompleteness of data and information, and then will enhance the quality of introduced services and decisions from smart cities to their citizens.

In order to make the correct use of resources, an accurate monitoring and management is needed. In some places, like underground aquifers, access for monitoring can be difficult, therefore the use of sensors can be a good solution. Groundwater is very important as a water resource. Just in the USA, aquifers represent the water source for 50% of the population. However, aquifers are endangered due to the contamination. One of the most important parameters to monitor in groundwater is the salinity, as high salinity levels indicate groundwater salinization. In this paper, we present a specific sensor for monitoring groundwater salinization. The sensor is able to measure the electric conductivity of water, which is directly related to the water salinization. The sensor, which is composed of two copper coils, measures the magnetic field alterations due to the presence of electric charges in the water. Different salinities of the water generate different alterations. Our sensor has undergone several tests in order to obtain a conductivity sensor with enough accuracy. First, several prototypes are tested and are compared with the purpose of choosing the best combination of coils. After the best prototype was selected, it was calibrated using up to 30 different samples. Our conductivity sensor presents an operational range from 0.585 mS/cm to 73.8 mS/cm, which is wide enough to cover the typical range of water salinities. With this work, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to measure water conductivity using solenoid coils and that this is a low cost application for groundwater monitoring. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940703000

Matrix factorisation has emerged as one of the main approaches for collaborative filtering as it can handle sparse matrices and produces good prediction accuracy. However, this process is resource-intensive and training must take place in the cloud, which can lead to a number of issues for user privacy and being able to update the model with new QoS information. Due to the time-varying nature of QoS it is essential to update the QoS prediction model to ensure that it is using the most recent values to maintain prediction accuracy. The request time, which is the time for a middleware to submit a user's information and receive QoS metrics for a candidate services is also important due to the limited time during dynamic service adaptations to choose suitable replacement services. In this paper we propose a stacked autoencoder with dropout on a deep edge architecture and show how this can be used to reduce training and request time compared to traditional matrix factorisation algorithms, while maintaining predictive accuracy. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithms we compare the actual and predicted QoS values using standard error metrics such as MAE and RMSE. In addition, we propose an alternative evaluation technique using the predictions as part of a service composition and measuring the impact that the predictions have on the response time and throughput of the final composition. This more clearly shows the direct impact that these algorithms will have in practice. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070188179

The physical proximity of these edge devices will allow for intelligent reasoning one hop away from data generation. This will allow a range of modern urban reasoning applications that require reduced latency and jitter such as remote surgery, vehicle collision detection and augmented reality. The traffic flow from IoT devices to the cloud will also be reduced as with the increased accuracy from deep learning models only a subset of the data will need to be reported after a first pass analysis. However, the training time of deep learning models can be long, taking weeks on multiple desktop GPUs for large datasets. In this paper we show how transfer learning can be used to update the last layers of pre-trained models at the edge of the network, dramatically reducing the training time and allowing the model to perform new tasks without data ever having to be sent to the cloud. This will also improve the users' privacy, which is a key requirement for urban intelligence applications with the introduction of GDPR. We compare our approach to alternative IoT urban intelligence architectures such as cloud-based architectures and deep learning algorithms trained only on local data. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078528624

Here we propose a novel approach to UI that extends available frameworks combining advanced multidisciplinary modelling of the city, simulation and learning tools with numerical optimization techniques, each of them specialized for the digital representation of city systems and subsystems, including not only city infrastructures, but also city users and their interactions. UI provides sets of candidate policies in complex scenarios and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing sustainable and personalized solutions. The main characteristics of the proposed UI architecture are (a) fully multidisciplinary integration of city layers, (b) connection and evolution with the city, (c) integration of participative strategies to include 'human-oriented' information, and (d) modularity of application. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076337791

As three patients waited, “Jane,” a 45-year-old graphic designer was seen for “skipped heart beat.” She works about 50 h a week, exercises at the local gym, and enjoys eating a healthy diet. About 4 months ago Jane began experiencing her heart “skipping beats.” She initially attributed the symptoms to long hours in the office and caffeine. But, over the holiday, her brother purchased a smart watch and she began digitally recording her cardiac rhythm. About a month ago, the device detected possible atrial fibrillation, so she called and scheduled this visit for a cardiology consultation. Upon that visitation, she and her physician reviewed the device readings. While it appeared to be an irregular rhythm, before either considered a treatment plan, they began to ask questions ranging from the following: “Is this an accurate diagnosis?” “What other data are available to better understand the risk of a cardiac arrhythmia?” “How is this data analyzed so that the best treatment plan can be made?” “And, what type of clinical decision support system is required to ‘virtually’ monitor people like me using digital health devices to improve the efficiency and quality of care delivered in population health?”. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066475823

This study is a foundational step toward enabling participation of all city stakeholders (i.e., government, industry, and citizens) in the decision making process and the creation of smart sustainable cities. Engaging city stakeholders in such a manner allows for collective participation in changes, which can enable continuous adaptation toward more sustaining growth and prosperity. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

The platform design covers self-healing functions based on self-awareness as well as basic functions such as inter-cloud, security/privacy management, and devices and data management. From the viewpoint of application development, ontology sharing is the most important to integrate services. This paper, the first step towards ontology sharing, defines the iKaaS data model as one that integrates data models used in all applications in the project. The data defined in the iKaaS data model is converted into RDF format and stored in the RDF database. The reasoning mechanism in semantic web allows the semantic integration of data and applications. The iKaaS project is developing a prototype community service, town management and healthcare, in Tagonishi's Smart City. Presenting the iKaaS data model for these said services, this paper emphasizes the necessity of higher contextual awareness to achieve the goal of a better-fitted personalization for the individual. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961798402
