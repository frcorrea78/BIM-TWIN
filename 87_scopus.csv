Then we propose a smart city infrastructure which is based on digital city, the Internet of Things (IOT) and cloud computing technologies. Smart city will achieve comprehensive awareness and management of people and things to provide various intelligent services. Smart city with mass sensors will continuously collect vast amounts of data. Big data in smart city also bring many problems and challenges. To deal with those big data-related issues, we propose a strategy mainly base on the cloud computing and data mining. After that, we presente a framework for cloud platform and propose the suggestion of establish smart city operation center. In the end, we look forward to a bright future for the smart city.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903434858

In a traditional design case, a planner may take into account numerous factors, such as economy, constructability, geological impacts, layout constraints, connection of localized and external traffic, etc., and the process is mainly relied on a master plan and two-dimensional design drawings. Such pattern has certain limitations as these important factors can hardly be overall considered at the same time. It is promising to cope with the issues using a cooperative system where Geographic Information System (GIS) incorporates with Building Information Modelling (BIM). The research aims to optimize and evaluate the site layout for effective traffic planning based on the integrative approach of BIM and GIS. From the case study, the paper also demonstrates: 1) the approach of analyzing the statistical data to represent the existing traffic condition around the building via GIS and 2) the approach of making use of the advanced vehicle simulation models to optimizing the localized traffic facilities design, considering the possible impact of the localized traffic to the ambient traffic. Referring to the cooperative system, the bottlenecks of the initial design of parking facilities are identified, and the corresponding improvements are suggested. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921693618
