Augmented Reality (AR), probably the best known of these, refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However quite different groupings are possible and this demonstrates the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. An approximately three-dimensional taxonomy is proposed comprising the following dimensions: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028714294

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

Majority of the current building maintenance systems mainly focus on capturing either information or knowledge. This research aims to develop an integrated system to capture information and knowledge of building maintenance operations when/after maintenance is carried out to understand how a building is deteriorating and to support preventive/corrective maintenance decisions. To develop the system, a number of case studies were investigated and interviews were conducted with professionals from different building maintenance departments in public organisations. This methodology helped identify the building maintenance process and the opportunities for knowledge capture and exchange. A taxonomy for building maintenance was then identified which enabled a formal approach for knowledge capture. The proposed system utilises the functions of information modelling techniques and knowledge systems to facilitate full retrieval of information and knowledge for maintenance work. The system consists of two modules; BIM module to capture relevant information and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) module to capture knowledge. The system can help maintenance teams learn from previous experience and trace the full history of a building element and all affected elements by previous maintenance operations. It is concluded that the integrated knowledge-based BIM systems can provide advanced useful functions for construction operations. On the other hand, incorporating Knowledge Management principles embedded in CBR systems with Information Management principles embedded in BIM systems is a way forward for the transformation from 'Building Information Modelling' to 'Building Knowledge Modelling'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for maintenance planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078707972

Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage.

Digital Twin provides advantages in different fields of manufacturing, such as production and design, remote diagnostics and service. Digital Twin relies on the continuously accumulated data and real-time presentation of the collected data to simultaneously update and modify with its physical counterpart. However, presenting a huge amount of collected data and information in a Digital Twin in an intuitive manner remains a challenge. Currently, augmented reality (AR) has been widely implemented in the manufacturing environment, such as product design, data management, assembly instructions, and equipment maintenance. By integrating graphics, audios and real-world objects, AR allows the users to visualise and interact with Digital Twin data at a new level. It gives the opportunity to provide intuitive and continual visualisation of the Digital Twin data. In this paper, an AR application that uses Microsoft HoloLens to visualise the Digital Twin data of a CNC milling machine in a real manufacturing environment is presented. The developed application allows the operator to monitor and control the machine tool at the same time, but also enables to interact and manage the Digital Twin data simultaneously, which provides an intuitive and consistent human machine interface to improve the efficiency during the machining process.

While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems. There is a clear gap of knowledge on how to structure a BIM model that allows its efficient use in the O&M phase. Furthermore, there is a lack of claritiy on how to exchange information from a BIM model into an Asset Information Model (AIM).

The paper describes the BIM model requirements, development of the extraction platform, database architecture and framework. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology.

Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. This paper discusses a specific BIM application within the context of railway station buildings using a Revit-based simulation of construction work for King's Cross station in London.

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value. In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized. Relying on empirical findings derived from nine projects that examined the efficiency gains and advantages of using a digital systems information model from an engineering to asset management perspective, we construct a generic BDN to visualize the structure of multiple cause-effect relationships that are used to organise the capabilities, changes and benefits that need to be considered prior to adoption.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated system to capture, retrieve, and manage information/knowledge for one of the key operations of asset management: building maintenance (BM). Design/methodology/approach – The proposed system consists of two modules; BIM module to capture relevant information and case-based reasoning (CBR) module to capture the operational knowledge of maintenance activities. The structure of the CBR module was based on analysis of a number of interviews and case studies conducted with professionals working in public BM departments. This paper discusses the development of the CBR module and its integration with the BIM module.

The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for FM in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages of the building lifecycle is intended to bridge the gap between operations and digital data, but lacks the functionality of assessing and forecasting the state of the built environment in real-time. To accommodate this, BIM data needs to be constantly updated with the current state of the built environment. However, generation of as-is BIM data for a digital representation of a building is a labor intensive process. While some software applications offer a degree of automation for the generation of as-is BIM data, they can be impractical to use for routinely updating digital FM documentation. Current approaches for capturing the built environment using remote sensing and photometry-based methods allow for the creation of 3D point clouds that can be used as basis data for a Digital Twin (DT), along with existing BIM and FM documentation. 3D point clouds themselves do not contain any semantics or specific information about the building components they represent physically, but using machine learning methods they can be enhanced with semantics that would allow for reconstruction of as-is BIM and basis DT data. This paper presents current research and development progress of a service-oriented platform for generation of semantically rich 3D point cloud representations of indoor environments. A specific focus is placed on the reconstruction and visualization of the captured state of the built environment for increasing FM stakeholder engagement and facilitating collaboration.

Recent advances in technologies such as building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks, augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense opportunity to radically improve the way daily O&M is conducted. This paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants’ thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach: The developed system focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O&M activities such as inspection, recording, communication and verification. Findings: Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an example, the case study demonstrates that the O&M management process can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system. Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site. Originality/value: The originality lies in bringing together the advances in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to support the daily O&M management activities. In particular, the paper presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for visualising those assets with related information. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087569841

Digital Twin (DT) technology is based on the integration of different “traditional” tools, such as simulation modeling and sensors, and is aimed at increasing process performance. In DTs, simulation modeling allows for the building of a digital copy of real processes, which is dynamically updated through data derived from smart objects based on sensor technologies. The use of DT within manufacturing activities is constantly increasing, as DTs are being applied in different areas, from the design phase to the operational ones. This study aims to analyze existing fields of applications of DTs for supporting safety management processes in order to evaluate the current state of the art. A bibliometric review was carried out through VOSviewer to evaluate studies and applications of DTs in the engineering and computer science areas and to identify research clusters and future trends. Next, a bibliometric and systematic review was carried out to deepen the relation between the DT approach and safety issues.

Its applications to life cycle management of buildings and infrastructures can further increase the social and economic benefits. As a complete information model, a digital twin integrates the information of a project from different stages of the life cycle into a model, in order to facilitate better asset management and communicate through data visualizations with participants. This paper unprecedently introduces a digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station. Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the project is the highest, accounting for 78% of the total cost. However, the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is higher than the amount during the production of building materials, accounting for 67%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66% of the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73% and 17.64%, respectively. In addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life cycle cost and carbon footprint. This initiative is relatively new to the industry. The new insight into life cycle assessment or LCA (especially carbon footprint over the life cycle) integrated with digital twin applications will enable sustainable development that will enhance resilience of metro railway systems globally. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092140180

This phenomenon is clearly observable in the manufacturing sector, where, due to the diffusion of Industry 4.0 paradigm, physical processes are integrating effectively with digital ones. One recent innovative technology is the Digital Twin (DT), where digital models and physical ones communicate – by sharing data as well as information – usually in a bidirectional way. As recent studies have analyzed the current level of adoption of DT technologies in the manufacturing sector, less effort has been focused on evaluating applications in the safety domain. Theoretically, the DT inherent capability of acquiring data from the physical world - usually developed in real time – together with the potentiality of reliable data processing could support a more effective diffusion of dynamic risk assessment models as well as real time alert management systems for improving safety. Otherwise, the actual capability of real applications highly depends on the level of complexity of the specific DT. The aim of the study is to provide a methodology to assess current application of DT technologies; the framework has been developed in the safety domain aiming to point out to researchers as well as technicians in a clear way the capabilities of a specific DT application. The framework has been adopted for analyzing current applications of DT in the scientific literature aiming to propose a theoretical validation. The application has outlined that, although the number of DT applications in the safety field is not so large, the current tools developed are characterized by a high level of complexity thus providing higher reliability to support the specific safety problem in analysis.

Furthermore, experts located at different sites can join via a virtual session. By inspecting a 3D model of the aircraft component, they can see synchronized information from a Digital Twin database.

For example, damage locations are marked by the inspector on the component's surface and are stored in the Digital Twin database. Our scenario demonstrates how new information can be derived from the combination of collected data and analyses from the Digital Twin database.

Many 3D city models have been created but a large portion of them neglect representing terrain and buildings accurately. Very often the surface is either considered planar or is not represented. On the other hand, many Digital Terrain Models (DTM) have been created as 2.5D triangular irregular networks (TIN) or grids for different applications such as water management, sign of view or shadow computation, tourism, land planning, telecommunication, military operations and communications. 3D city models need to represent both the 3D objects and terrain in one consistent model, but still many challenges remain. A critical issue when integrating 3D objects and terrain is the identification of the valid intersection between 2.5D terrain and 3D objects. Commonly, 3D objects may partially float over or sink into the terrain; the depth of the underground parts might not be known; or the accuracy of data sets might be different. This paper discusses some of these issues and presents an approach for a consistent 3D reconstruction of LOD1 models on the basis of 3D point clouds, DTM, and 2D footprints of buildings.

Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure.

Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, bIm can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, bIm is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility management (Fm). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in Fm. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of Fm operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image recognition (Imr), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data.

A linear static analysis was performed to investigate the instantaneous impacts of dead and wind loads on the complex concrete structure which was completed in 1973. A quasistatic analysis was performed to predict the effects of creep and shrinkage due to dead load on the structure in 2050 to discern its longevity. In 2050, the Sydney Opera House is expected to experience 0.090% element strain due to creep and shrinkage and therefore suffer prestress losses of 32.59 kN per strand. However, given that the current time after prestress loading is approximately 50 years, the majority of creep and shrinkage effects have already taken place with 0.088% strain and 32.12 kN of prestress losses. The analysis concludes that very minor structural impacts are expected over the next 30 years due to creep and shrinkage, suggesting a change in conservation focus from large structural concerns to inspection and maintenance of minor issues of surface cracking and water ingress. The analysis is the first step in the application of more complex finite element modelling of the structure with the integration of complex building information models.

It is difficult to simultaneously solve the temporal, spatial, and exogenous dependencies between pavement performance data and maintenance, the service life of highways, the environment, and other factors. Digital twin technology based on the building information modeling (BIM) model, combined with machine learning, puts forward a new perspective and method for the accurate and timely prediction of pavement performance. In this paper, we propose a highway tunnel pavement performance prediction approach based on a digital twin and multiple time series stacking (MTSS). This paper (1) establishes an MTSS prediction model with heterogeneous stacking of eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), ridge regression, and support vector regression (SVR) component learners after exploratory data analysis (EDA); (2) proposes a method based on multiple time series feature extraction to accurately predict the pavement performance change trend, using the highway segment as the minimum computing unit and considering multiple factors; (3) uses grid search with the k-fold cross validation method to optimize hyperparameters to ensure the robustness, stability, and generalization ability of the prediction model; and (4) constructs a digital twin for pavement performance prediction to realize the real-time dynamic evolution of prediction. The method proposed in this study is applied in the life cycle management of the Dalian highway-crossing tunnel in Shanghai, China. A dataset covering 2010-2019 is collected for real-time prediction of the pavement performance. The prediction accuracy evaluation shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.1314, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.0386, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 5.10%, and the accuracy is 94.90%. Its overall performance is better than a single model. The results verify that the prediction method based on digital twin and MTSS is feasible and effective in the highway tunnel pavement performance prediction. © 2020 Gang Yu et al.

At present, many studies focus on the capture of geometry for the modelling of primary components, overlooking the fact that many recurring actions need to be conducted on assets inside buildings. Furthermore, highly accurate survey techniques like laser scanning need long offsite processing for object recognition. Performing such process on site would dramatically impact efficiency and also prevent the need to revisit the site in the case of insufficient/incomplete data. In this paper, an Augmented Reality (AR) system is proposed enabling inventory, information retrieval and information update directly on-site. It would reduce post-processing work and avoid loss of information and unreliability of data. The system has a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) AR interface that lets the technician interact hands-free with the real world and digital information contained in the BIM/AIM. A trained Deep Learning Neural Network operates the automatic recognition of objects in the field of view of the user and their placement into the digital BIM. In this paper, two uses cases are described: one is the inventory of small assets inside buildings to populate a BIM/AIM, and the second is the retrieval of relevant information from the AIM to support maintenance operations. Partial development and feasibility tests of the first use case applied to fire extinguishers, have been carried out to assess the feasibility and value of this system. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

Building Information Models (BIM) are critical for Asset Management (AM), especially when used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) and other asset data collected throughout a building’s lifecycle. However, information contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an asset anomaly detection application.

This paper provides an overview of the technologies and describes how the design, implementation and control processes in these projects can be performed more safely and accurately at lower cost. Over three decades ago, businesses experienced a leap in performance, code reusability and maintainability when their information technologies moved from numbered line to object-oriented programming (OOP). We are now poised at the cusp of another quantum change in efficiency as a result of technology. In this new era data travels from “cradle to grave.” From design, construction or assembly, to use, service and final dismantling of refineries and industrial facilities, the physical world of discrete elements will have an accurate digital equivalent. Thanks to powerful computing and Big Data warehousing, complex structures with millions of individual parts can now be tracked and displayed like intelligent LEGO® structures. The vision is that by adopting an open, agree-upon, and already-existing platform for technical communication among different software vendors, huge improvements in efficiency results from enabling a platform or “communal space” that interacts seamlessly with remote presence tools, and a global talent pool working side-by-side with local workers and designers in a virtual fashion. The technology for these real time virtual worlds is already commonplace in online video gaming. Together with the ability to log the activities in this parallel virtual but completely accurate digital world using Big Data, an exhaustive register from initial design through construction, operation and eventual dismantling may be used for detailed analysis, training and automation of preventive maintenance and safety, resulting in lower costs from improved efficiency and better management and enhanced safety. Extending this model and common language of data communication to include various industries, such as engineering, construction, aviation and military operations provides economies of scale in the adoption of an open, global and flexible platform for use by all, but without restricting innovation or compromising security. 3D provides spatial information as in existing CAD systems, adding the time element '4D' incorporates project management and logistics. The next logical step includes cost and supplier information for informed complete life-cycle management of the equipment, project or facility, or '5D'.

Asset owners are given the opportunity to become additionally owners of digital assets, while the need for conceptual approaches and digital asset management is growing. With the increasing application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for asset management within architecture, engineering, construction and owner-operated (AECO) sector, BIM-enabled asset management has been increasingly attracting more attentions in both research and practice. The problem associated with the development and production of facilities is related to the discrepancy between as-built as-designed and as-is facilities or complex technical systems. During the stages of design, construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), the actually manufactured (i.e. as-built) complex technical object (or production infrastructure) differs, sometimes significantly, from the designed (as-designed), and at the same time inconsistency between the created production and production infrastructure within which it should operate grows. Solving the problem of discrepancy between the actually created and designed facility or the complex technical system, in the absence of digital technologies, requires considerable time for the so-called ""trial operation"", during which the discrepancies are eliminated and a mechanism for managing production and production infrastructure in real conditions is developed. With the development of the digital economy, the need for digitalization of asset management is growing. An analysis of existing information technologies shows that there is a possibility of reducing the cost of production and operation of an asset by concentrating the main costs at the design stage. The article discusses basic approaches to organizing the lifecycle management of technical systems, production and infrastructure in the context of global digitalization which become a useful tool for reduction of trial operation time.

The challenge that this research aims to resolve is: 'how can a virtual system adjust itself to the constantly changing conditions of the physical space of information that influences the operational dynamics of maintenance in industry?'. This article presents an augmented reality (AR) assisted digital twin (DT) solution that can be used to calibrate mobile robots in maintenance environments. This DT solution was achieved by providing the user the ability to predict the battery charge of the mobile robot by using historic data as the input and providing the user a visual representation of the mobile robot's movements using an AR device as a medium to display this digital data. Overall, the trial demonstration was a success in implementing a DT to calibrate a mobile robot with AR assistance. Therefore, this DT solution can be implemented into niche areas of industrial environments. With the capability of predicting the battery charge enabling the user to know when the mobile robot will be empty, the user can maximise its use before recalling it for the charge. This would improve the accuracy of scheduling when mobile robots can be deployed and maximise the utilization of the robot and reduce the running cost of mobile robots in the long term.

However, the possible applications of extended reality in these processes is a new field of research that has to be developed. Within current paper an approach to optimize the existing, analogously documented processes by using extended reality is presented. The maintenance of an industrial plant is mainly based on analogue and manual methods and processes. Usually all maintenance information is documented analogously and transferred to the corresponding management systems with a certain delay after the inspection. The time delay can lead to data loss and errors and can also occur during transmission to an appropriate system. In the future, the maintenance data and changes to the real object should be determined digital and transferred to the data management system in real time. A digital twin should enable the unambiguous assignment of the data to the corresponding elements and thus represent a virtual representation of the AS-IS state of the industrial plant. The required process data will be collected in Mixed Reality and then transferred to a PDM-System. To transfer the data records without loss, a system model can be used as an interface between the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality device and the PDM system. The HoloLens enables the determination of a coordinate point from the combination of gaze vector and the position of the observer. The coupled system model allows this coordinate point to be compared with a coordinate field within the reference model to determine the component.

The architecture is compared to traditional ""IoT data to the cloud"" models and on-premise point solutions, illustrating the effectiveness of computing at the edge with a generic IoT solution. Customer benefits from the solution are presented and discussed. The initial solution framework of asset condition monitoring and predictive maintenance is provided by on-premise data analytics software incorporating historical models of asset behavior. Computer hardware traditionally available only in data centers is available to provide powerful computing capabilities. A wireless communications mesh is implemented to provide secure connectivity between plant assets, computers and workers. A digital twin is constructed and augmented reality methods are implemented to extract information from the raw data. Inclusion of plant personnel from planning, to installation, to implementation has been critical to the acceptance and use of the technology in operations. Implementation of a generic IoT architecture rather than a point solution increases the value obtained from the initial investment as subsequent solution frameworks are added. An IoT platform operating at the ""intelligent edge"" can be more efficient and less costly than cloud-based solutions, reducing time from acquired data to corrective action. An architecture which accounts for role-based and location-aware data presentation further increases the value of the data to the individual worker.

An example obtained from former research mainly done in the MistralWind project will demonstrate the possibilities of modern sensing techniques applied to a wind turbine. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Offering a more intelligent approach to the maintenance regime, using prevention rather than cure, therefore, results in real time and cost benefits that are deliverable now. Increased automation at Festo's factory has enhanced the role of maintenance and led to a greater emphasis on sharing knowledge. The Scharnhausen Technology Plant is Festo's main production facility for valves, valve terminals, and control electronics, covering 66,000m2 of space arranged over four levelsand housing a workforce of around 1200 people. To create the Industry 4.0 environment, Festo has either piggy backed intelligence onto existing machines or embedded it in new equipment. The plant uses Near Field Communications (NFC) for digital maintenance support. This means that equipment components can exchange data directly with the maintenance team without passing through a central database. For the maintenance team, this presents new ways to interact with the factory equipment and gather useful data. Their main tool is a tablet with a mobile depth sensor, enables the user to acess more information the closer they are to the components requiring attention. At the high level the tablet may show an ovreview graphic of the entire plant layout and indicate that there is an alert raised on a machine on a production line. For less serious events, information about the reasons for the alert can be interrogated remotely without any need to interrupt production. Augmented reality is another exciting area under development. The concept of a Digital Twin - a CAD generated model that enables designers to simulate how a machine will function, is already possible.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021757075

It is possible to enhance building responsive operation by gathering granular data on passive systems’ operation and space occupation by setting a building component, that houses a sensor network.

The Brazilian government’s new regulatory sanitation framework [3] was approved in December 2019, establishing goals to accelerate water and sewerage coverage, stimulating private investors either to build new or to operate existing plants. However, the asset inventory handover process from the public to the private sector is unstructured, causing numerous operational and maintenance challenges to new operators and investors. This paper presents the digital transformation framework applied in Aegea, a private group of water and sewage utilities in Brazil, aiming to meet in a sustainable way a social, environmental and financial value (SLO - Social License to Operate) [15] by combining Building Information Modelling (BIM) [17] and Asset Management (AM) [8] disciplines.

As a traditional project documentation is changing in “digital twin” of building work, the way of building work design changes too. Building design and project documentation do not serve only for the building construction, maintenance and operation. Project documentation is the output, also the input – both at the same time - in connection with further building legislation, landscape planning, etc. BIM model, nowadays the highest quality of project documentation, should communicate with many related registers. Important basic information is as an input for the project design, afterwards information from the project design should be reflected as an output for the enlisting in related registers. Due to the absence of efficient digitization of the construction industry, the relevancy, correctness and reliability of information in the related registers is not very high in the Czech Republic, at this time. Digitization of construction industry and implementation of BIM technology promises many benefits. The magnitude of these benefits depends on how the data exchange is modified in the construction process during the whole building lifecycle. This paper reveals possibilities of basic principles of the new way of design using BIM technology, connections of BIM model data and related registers and their data exchange in the environment of Czech Republic´s legislation. The more correctly processed the model of the building work, the better and more reliable information for future designs. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Operational phases have the biggest impact on the total life cycle costs. The introduction of BIM and the creation of a building information model, albeit at a higher price, will be counterbalanced several times by a more efficient way of managing the building during its life cycle, the possibility of creating a healthier indoor environment for building users and better access to necessary information, for example in the case of changes to completed buildings. The BIM model is a digital equivalent of a real construction - real digital twin. It contains geometric data in the form of a 3D model and non-geometry data, including construction management and support documents. The BIM model allows access to building usage information. The information obtained is more accurate. It keeps building element information up to date, enabling more informed decisions. It supports comparison of different solutions and their energy needs. Renovation can be done more efficiently. Construction information is up-to-date, so we can use the time needed to process different solutions instead of finding the necessary information about the construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097096733

They offer real-time execution of advanced control schemes, e.g., for smart buildings, but also various analysis tasks, e.g., for predictive maintenance that ensures resilience. In this, they need to cope with change: The physical twins they mirror operate in a highly dynamic environment with unknown or unexpected variables and impact factors to which they adapt or are adapted to via upgrades, maintenance, or behavioral changes. Keeping digital twins fit for their purpose over their lifecycle is thus a demanding governance challenge that needs to be addressed in tandem with the lifecycle management of the mirrored system. We argue that the best practices of Systems Engineering (SE) and Information Technology (IT), especially software development, need to be brought together to succeed. In this paper, we present a joint SE and IT lifecycle model called the Double Helix model. It highlights the concurrent governance processes of both twins, capturing the temporal dynamics of the environment and the system itself. It accents the important concept of the leading twin. The Double Helix model captures both design and operational phases of SE and management, going from cradle to grave, by empowering a shift from using data in offline simulations during design, to the online operational phase. © 2020 IEEE",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098911428

Secondly, the AR equipment is reconstructed to have the ability of deep environmental awareness in order to achieve accurate three-dimensional registration. Finally, situation awareness is realized by multi-sensor fusion, and the information guide is enhanced by fusion for the change of external environment and equipment status. The experimental results show that the augmented reality assembly guidance system based on the concept of digital twin can effectively perceive the external abnormal environment changes and the position and posture of components.

Subcontractors and fabricators need ICV to measure the progress of the work completed, to better understand and capture the status of the built environment, and to measure the quality of the fabricated components and modules. Using digital twins of the components and modules at the design phase and the construction phase, subcontractors and fabricators are capable of tracking the required information. ICV combined with some further technologies have opened some unprecedented opportunities to improve the fabrication, installation, and maintenance procedures. ICV is first investigated from the subcontractors’ perspectives. Various perspectives for different trades including steel fabricators, formwork fabricators, reinforcing steel fabricators, etc., are discussed to better frame the ICV solutions for the subcontractors and fabricators. A brief summary on the state-of-the-art research and practice is also presented. It will then evaluate production monitoring at two different stages: (1) off-site production monitoring and (2) on-site production monitoring. Next, fabrication control methods and the existing technologies are then thoroughly discussed. Vision-based techniques and visual analytics for as-built status assessment and discrepancy quantification are then thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, a systematic realignment strategy for construction components is presented. Finally, a summary is provided to assess the vision-based approaches for geometric quality control and as-built status modeling in terms of accuracy and time-effectiveness. The potential of adopting the sensing technologies in subcontractors’ and fabricators’ practice is provided with the aim of replacing the current tape measurement practice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
