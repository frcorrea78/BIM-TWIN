These alternative binders use a wide range of aluminosilicate precursors, with differing availabilities, reactivities, costs and CO2 emissions. Despite all the studies published on improving the characteristics of these materials in the last decades, some aspects of alkali-activated binders require further investigations. For instance, shrinkage in alkali-activated binders due to the different chemical processes being involved is more complicated than OPC composites and it plays a key role in long-term performance. However, information on the shrinkage behavior of these binder systems is scattered and fragmented. Therefore, this review critically surveys the drying shrinkage behavior of alkali-activated binders with slag, fly ash and metakaolin. The mechanisms of the drying shrinkage and the factors that affect shrinkage are discussed. Different solutions to limit the shrinkage are also presented. Then, an analysis is conducted based on the literature, and the main chemical elements affecting the drying shrinkage of alkali-activated materials are proposed. Finally, the feasibility of using the developed empirical models for predicting the drying shrinkage of OPC concretes is also investigated for alkali activated binders. This review shows that alkali-activated slag binders generally have the higher rate of the drying shrinkage compared to other alkali activated binders, albeit, reinforcing the plain compositions with fibers, using expanding admixtures, curing at elevated temperatures, using a combination of slag with fly ash or metakaolin reduces successfully the drying shrinkage. Moreover, utilizing ternary diagrams, it is revealed that the molar ratio of Ca/Si has the greatest impact on the rate of drying shrinkage in the alkali-activated binders. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053934731

In this phase – the first cracks in the material are initiated, and the process of destruction of the composite begins. An improvement of the ITZ properties are positively influenced by the mineral additives used for the composite. One of such a substitute for a binder is, potentially hazardous industrial waste, siliceous fly ash (FA). In this paper the ITZ between aggregate and cement paste in concretes containing FA is considered. The paper presents the results of tests on the effect of the addition of FA in the amount of: 0, 20 and 30% by weight of cement on morphology and size of cracks of the ITZ in composites. In matured concretes the smallest cracks occur in composite with the 20% FA additive. It can be concluded that composites with 20% addition of FA are characterized by low permeability and therefore high durability. The results of tests carried out can be helpful in obtaining concrete with the highest possible: strength, durability and reliability of operation. Moreover, such procedures also cause a restriction storage of hazardous materials, i.e. FA – by 160 million tons per year. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048579224

The value of information can be enhanced by its currency, accessibility and the ability to correlate data sets (integration of information sources). A building information model correlated to various information sources related to the facility is used as definition for a digital facility model. Such a digital facility model would give transparent and an integrated access to an array of dataseis and obviously would support Facility Management processes. In order to construct such a digital facility model, two state-of-the-art Information and Communication technologies are considered: an internationally standardized building information model called the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and a variety of advanced communication and integration technologies often referred to as the Semantic Web such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). This paper reports on some technical aspects for developing a digital facility model focusing on Sydney Opera House.

An experimental/analytical approach was adopted to characterize the mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) and the drying shrinkage rate of the reinforced self-compacting mortars and fly ash-slag geopolymer mortars with inclusion of different recycled glass fiber volume fractions and lengths. To this end, a total of 207 specimens were experimentally tested. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were used to detect the failure mechanism of recycled glass fibers. Moreover, based on the collected data, some empirical equations were developed to correlate recycled glass fiber volume fractions to the mechanical properties of the reinforced fly ash-slag geopolymer mortars and self-compacting mortars, considering high values of coefficient of determination.

This paper explores the process of construction technology implementation, including the main activities, assessment criteria, and the mechanism through which it influences future technology purchase decisions. To achieve this purpose, 98 experienced practitioners from Australia and the United States were interviewed, and the process used by customers during technology adoption decisions was extracted in the form of thematic analysis. This paper presents an original framework including the key subprocesses of technology implementation describing the activities of customers and vendors, including operation commencement, maintenance set up, and assessment. In addition, the findings show that customers assess the implementation based on assessment criteria, including down time, interpersonal relationship, and technology operation quality. Comparison between the United States and Australia showed that rapport with the vendor is more important in large markets, whereas lead time and disposal are more important in remote markets. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by validating a framework that incorporates both customer and vendor activities into a unique framework of three subprocesses.

With a significant potential to contribute to high-performance built environment, positioning systems and laser scanners are being increasingly utilised to the construction industry for acquisition of 3D models of buildings. However, there are major barriers to successful scanner implementation in construction projects including a lack of knowledge about the scanner applications, low skilled workers and complicated data analysis processes. While many studies focus on general IT/ICT adoption in construction, there is a lack of understanding about the process of sensing technology adoption and its utilization in construction. To address the gap in the literature, this paper presents the Scanner Technology Acceptance Model (STAM) utilizing two main criteria; 'usefulness' and 'ease of use' each measured by a range of factors. The model is verified based on the result of the application of scanner and location system in a university building renovation project. The scanners were used to collect raw 3D point clouds to transfer into a compact, semantically rich models aiding in updating construction drawings. The findings show the effectiveness of the STAM. STAM enables technology suppliers to predict the technology diffusion rate, and helps the users to make decisions on choosing the right technology in construction projects.

Additionally, incremental models will support the as-built model through demonstration of hidden construction in the finished building. This is achieved by evaluating state-of-the-art scanner technologies to determine relative performance and accuracy in creating part-built models. Five laser-based scenarios using state-of-the-art handheld and terrestrial scanners were deployed to examine their capability to accurately produce part-built modeling from constructed objects. It was found that terrestrial scanners provided more accurate part-built information models, although the operation process is technical and requires skilled operators. However, handheld instruments avoid individual setup points and take less time than a terrestrial station when scanning typical internal building floor areas.

For such studies, the first step is to acquire 3D point clouds of urban form such as by airborne lidar sensors. There is a technical question in respect of pixel and object based building classification approaches on time series lidar data as to which approach is more appropriate for comparing volumetric indicators of 3D urban development sustainability over time. This paper aims to answer this question by comparing the results of building classification of bi-temporal airborne lidar datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and an object-based classification tool in ERDAS software. The results show that the omission errors for classified building points are not similar for the same buildings in the bi-temporal lidar data sets. This inconsistency affects the measurement of volumetric descriptors of 3D urban form over time. Therefore, two change detection methods of image differencing and SVM are also evaluated. While the level of noise in the SVM change detection results is lower than occurring in results derived by image differencing, the magnitude of change cannot be determined using SVM. Therefore, we conclude that a combination of change detection methods is preferred for spatio-temporal urban analyses. © 2017 The Authors.

The predominant data that have been used in the construction industry so far is rather less accurate. Moreover, the conventional methods of data acquisition are based on fieldwork that is time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive. Accuracy of original data and efficiency of data acquisition could be enhanced using new LiDAR technologies. LiDAR is the advanced remote sensing technology that is able to provide 3D data with centimeter to millimeter level accuracy effectively and efficiently. However, the implementation of 3D data for accurate as-built creation is still challenging, especially for openings and fine details of the construction objects in an indoor environment. This paper presents a framework for rapid as-built modeling using 3D point cloud data captured by a handheld LiDAR The procedure involves five key stages from data capturing to create a final model. This paper reports the implementation of the framework using the state-of-the-art mobile LiDAR to analyze fine details of a sample building. LiDAR data of a sample building in an indoor environment is captured using a mobile laser scanner and is analyzed after registration and segmentation processes. The reconstructed model using the as-built data is compared with the existing 2D AutoCAD plans of the sample building and the traditional measurements to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The results of this ongoing study confirm that the proposed model development technique can serve as a reliable tool for accurate development of rapid as-built building models (rABM).

However, the use of a restrained ellipse ring test is especially interesting for materials that will be used in restrained conditions like repair mortars. This paper provides results on restrained and unrestrained shrinkage performance of fly ash AACB mortars. The restrained shrinkage was assessed with an elliptical ring that provides a faster and more reliable assessment of the cracking potential than circular rings. The results show that the mixtures with lower sodium silicate content are associated to a lower unrestrained shrinkage. Mixtures with lower sodium silicate content showed reduced average crack width under restrained conditions. The results also show that the reduction of sodium silicate content delays the appearance of cracks and is also associated to lower crack width.

This paper provides a brief overview of recent work focussed on the development of a Concrete Conservation Framework for the Sydney Opera House that was supported by the Getty Foundation through its 'Keeping It Modern' initiative, as well as the recent implementation into a Building Information Model with user-friendly graphical interfaces available for managers, the maintenance team and inspectors. Within this framework, each concrete component of the building is planned to be classified and associated with a methodology to assist the Sydney Opera House to determine the best way forward for its conservation in accordance with its Conservation Management Plan.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050108952
