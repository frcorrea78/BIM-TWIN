IFC has been in development by an industry consortium since 1994, and since the start of the effort, the evolving industry context, standardization organization, resource availability, and technology development have exposed the standardization process to a dynamic environment. While the overarching mission of IFC standardization has always been to enable interoperability between AEC/FM software applications, the approach for how best to operationalize that mission has changed over the years. Through a literature review supported by the general theory on IT standardization, this study follows the development process of the IFC standard from its origins in the early 1990s to its latest activities in 2012. The end result is both a descriptive review of the history of IFC standardization and the establishment of an initial connection to IT standardization research for the IFC standard by profiling the effort in accordance with existing IT standardization theories and typologies. The review highlights the evolution of IFC standardization through several distinct phases, and its gradual movement from emphasizing technical architecture development towards growing involvement in specifying the processes facilitating its use. The organization behind the standard has also seen changes in its modus operandi, from initially being a closed and loosely coupled alliance to evolving into a consortium incorporating open hybrid standardization, where a formal standards body publishes the standards prepared by the consortium. The consortium has faced many challenges compiling an ambitious interoperability standard with few resources, and were it not for the growing demand for the standard provided by public actors, momentum and enthusiasm for the effort might have petered out due to slow market uptake and low use of the data standard in actual construction projects thus far. While this paper does not investigate the adoption phenomenon in-depth, the moderate uptake of the standard can perhaps be explained to be a symptom of the slow adoption of collaborative model-based construction processes and industry reluctance to switch over to new IT tools, which in turn are prerequisites for the existence of demand for an open interoperability standard.

Pedestrian simulations can identify potential threats already in the design phase of a building and evaluate protective measures. The BIM model serves as a central structure, which is going to be optimized by simulations (cf. figure 1). The building design is validated by a pedestrian simulation against performance indicators like the overall evacuation time or densities inside congestions. In order to improve the corresponding performance of the building, the simulator can automatically optimize relevant features of the BIM model - like door openings and wave breakers. After a review by the architect or engineer, the changes can be directly transferred to the model. Pedestrian streams turned out to be a limiting factor for building safety, particularly regarding emergency evacuation and the capacity of critical elements like stairways, escalators and elevators. © 2014 ASHRAE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938866564

The various suppliers and engineers provide their input in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which in turn is used for design coordination. However, the IFCs have to undergo an intermediate checking process to ensure compliance with various client-set and technical requirements. The paper focuses on the potential of (semi-)automatic IFC compliance checks and discusses a relevant recent initiative in the Netherlands, according to which several IFC compliance criteria were agreed among 14 contractors. This study aims to unravel the changes induced by this development not only as to the IFC compliance checks, but also as to potentially balancing the roles between the BIM coordinator and the suppliers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016560669
