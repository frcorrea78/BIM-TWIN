However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015707925

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability.

The objective of this study is to investigate how potential fall hazards that are unknowingly built into the construction schedule can be identified and eliminated early in the planning phase of a construction project. A survey of research on construction safety and BIM is presented first. Then, a framework was developed that includes automated safety rule-checking algorithms for BIM.

Through this, it is possible to allow all stakeholders to retrieve and generate information from the same model, enabling them to work cohesively. To identify gaps of existing work and evaluate new studies in this area, a BIM application framework is developed and discussed in this paper. Such a framework gives an overview of BIM applications in the construction industry. A literature review, within this framework, has been conducted and the result reveals a research gap for BIM applications in the project domains of quality, safety and environmental management. A computable multi-dimensional (nD) model is difficult to establish in these areas because with continuously changing conditions, the decision making rules for evaluating whether an individual component is considered good quality, or whether a construction site is safe, also vary as the construction progresses.

IFC has been in development by an industry consortium since 1994, and since the start of the effort, the evolving industry context, standardization organization, resource availability, and technology development have exposed the standardization process to a dynamic environment. While the overarching mission of IFC standardization has always been to enable interoperability between AEC/FM software applications, the approach for how best to operationalize that mission has changed over the years. Through a literature review supported by the general theory on IT standardization, this study follows the development process of the IFC standard from its origins in the early 1990s to its latest activities in 2012. The end result is both a descriptive review of the history of IFC standardization and the establishment of an initial connection to IT standardization research for the IFC standard by profiling the effort in accordance with existing IT standardization theories and typologies. The review highlights the evolution of IFC standardization through several distinct phases, and its gradual movement from emphasizing technical architecture development towards growing involvement in specifying the processes facilitating its use. The organization behind the standard has also seen changes in its modus operandi, from initially being a closed and loosely coupled alliance to evolving into a consortium incorporating open hybrid standardization, where a formal standards body publishes the standards prepared by the consortium. The consortium has faced many challenges compiling an ambitious interoperability standard with few resources, and were it not for the growing demand for the standard provided by public actors, momentum and enthusiasm for the effort might have petered out due to slow market uptake and low use of the data standard in actual construction projects thus far. While this paper does not investigate the adoption phenomenon in-depth, the moderate uptake of the standard can perhaps be explained to be a symptom of the slow adoption of collaborative model-based construction processes and industry reluctance to switch over to new IT tools, which in turn are prerequisites for the existence of demand for an open interoperability standard.

Forecasting enables informed and efficient responses for electricity demand. However, various forecasting models exist making it difficult for inexperienced researchers to make an informed model selection. This paper presents a systematic review of forecasting models with the main purpose of identifying which model is best suited for a particular case or scenario. Over 113 different case studies reported across 41 academic papers have been used for the comparison. The timeframe, inputs, outputs, scale, data sample size, error type and value have been taken into account as criteria for the comparison. The review reveals that despite the relative simplicity of all reviewed models, the regression and/or multiple regression are still widely used and efficient for long and very long-term prediction. For short and very short-term prediction, machine-learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and time series analysis (including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)) are favoured. The most widely employed independent variables are the building and occupancy characteristics and environmental data, especially in the machine learning models. In many cases, time series analysis and regressions rely on electricity historical data only, without the introduction of exogenous variables. Overall, if the singularity of the different cases made the comparison difficult, some trends are clearly identifiable. Considering the large amount of use cases studied, the meta-analysis of the references led to the identification of best practices within the expert community in relation to forecasting use for electricity consumption and power load prediction. Therefore, from the findings of the meta-analysis, a taxonomy has been defined in order to help researchers make an informed decision and choose the right model for their problem (long or short term, low or high resolution, building to country level). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027888921

This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management.

The method leverages 4D Building Information Models (BIM) and 3D point cloud models generated from site photologs using Structure-from-Motion techniques. To initialize, a user manually assigns correspondences between the point cloud model and BIM, which automatically brings in the photos and the 4D BIM into alignment from all camera viewpoints. Through reasoning about occlusion, each BIM element is back-projected on all images that see that element. From these back-projections, several 2D patches are sampled per element and are classified into different material types. To perform material classification, the expected material type information is derived from BIM. Then the image patches are convolved with texture and color filters and their concatenated vector-quantized responses are compared with multiple discriminative material classification models that are relevant to the expected progress of that element. For each element, a quantized histogram of the observed material types is formed and the material type with the highest appearance frequency infers the appearance and thus the state of progress. To validate, four new datasets of incomplete and noisy point cloud models are introduced which are assembled from real-world construction site images and BIMs. An extended version of the Construction Material Library (CML) is also introduced for training/testing the material classifiers. The material classification shows an average accuracy of 92.4% for CML image patches of 100 × 100 pixels. The experiments on those four datasets show an accuracy of 95.9%, demonstrating the potential of appearance-based recognition method for inferring the actual state of construction progress for BIM elements. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is well-known that machine learning models could fail in simulating streamflows from only meteorological variables in the absence of antecedent streamflow values. The main reason for this could be low and lagged relationships between streamflow and meteorological variables. To overcome this inefficiency, for the first time, we developed a simulation framework by coupling a base flow separation method to three machine learning methods. It was demonstrated that separating streamflow into different components such as base flow and surface flow can be useful for improving simulation and forecasting capabilities of machine learning models. We simulated streamflow in four rivers in the United States with Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) as a function of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We concluded that the base flow separation method improved the simulation performances of the machine learning models to a certain degree. Apart from the simulation scheme, we also employed a forecasting scheme by using the antecedent observed discharge values in addition to P, T, and PET. We discussed performances of models in simulation and forecasting of streamflow regarding model types, input structures and catchment dynamics in detail. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049729878

Only when it has been properly updated can the 4D CAD model reflect the real progress of a construction site to inform managerial decision making. However, updating a 4D CAD model is time-consuming and labor-intensive because the full updating process, from site data acquisition to 4D model regeneration, is typically conducted manually. This difficulty in updating a 4D model discourages industry practitioners from actively adopting 4D models. This paper presents an image processing-based methodology for the automatic updating of a 4D CAD model. Characterized by 3D CAD-based image mask filters, color-based noise removal, and area-based progress calculation, the image processing approach provides as-built schedule information. The schedule information is then automatically integrated with an existing 3D CAD model in batch-processing modes to produce the updated 4D CAD model.

Facilitated by the BIM's quantity takeoffs, the operations simulation is able to consider uncertain durations of work tasks, which allows it to consider the competing needs for resources among multiple work tasks, and to evaluate various resource allocation strategies in order to create a suitable construction plan.

This paper proposes and validates a method that overcomes this limitation by employing stereo cameras and converting 2D pixel coordinates to three-dimensional (3D) metric coordinates. The proposed method consists of four steps: camera calibration, camera pose estimation, 2D tracking, and triangulation. Given that the method employs fixed, calibrated stereo cameras with a long baseline, appropriate algorithms are selected for each step. Once the first two steps reveal camera system parameters, the third step determines 2D pixel coordinates of entities in subsequent frames. The 2D coordinates are triangulated on the basis of the camera system parameters to obtain 3D coordinates.

With recent advances in BIM technology, project information in BIM can be analyzed in the early design and planning stages to address potential safety issues. However, despite the impact on safety and productivity of the entire construction project, temporary structures, such as formwork and scaffolds, are often omitted from drawings or BIM. In practice, it is challenging to consider temporary structures in current manual jobsite safety analysis which is time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, in construction plans, potential safety hazards related to temporary structures are unknowingly created which need to be identified and prevented during the construction phases. Focusing on scaffolds, this research integrates temporary structures into automated safety checking approach using BIM. A safety planning platform was created to simulate and visualize spatial movements of work crews using scaffolding. Computational algorithms in the platform automatically identify safety hazards related to activities working on scaffolding and preventive measures can be prepared before the construction begins. The algorithms were implemented in a commercially available BIM software as a plug-in and validated with a real-world construction project. The results show that the algorithms could identify safety hazards that were not noticed by project managers participating in the case study project.

However, in case of many projects which consist of diverse activities in limited area, the workspace conflict analysis for reducing interferences caused by labor or equipment work is also an important management factor. In particular, if some activities are constructed adjacent to the overlap period, the workspace for those activities may be conflicting. Workspace conflicts decrease work productivity, and accidents can occur. Therefore, it is desirable that the workspace conflict should be minimized in order to perform efficient work. This paper presents a methodology that generates workspaces using a bounding box model and an algorithm in order to identify schedule and workspace conflict. Additionally, a workspace conflict verification system was developed to analyze the workspace information by integrating algorithms that include the automated generation of workspace models and an automatic check of workspace conflict within a 4D simulator. If a project manager can identify the workspace conflict using the system described, the overlapped activities can be rescheduled to minimize the conflict. A case study of a bridge project has been conducted to evaluate the practical applications and feasibility of the developed system.

However, early assessment of delays or accelerations during the phase of construction enables the adjustment of subsequent and dependent tasks. Manually performed, this involves many human resources if as-built information is not immediately available. This is particularly valid for indoor environments, where a general overview of tasks is not given. In this paper, we present a novel method that increases the degree of automation for indoor progress monitoring. The novel method recognizes the actual state of construction activities from as-built video data based on as-planned BIM data using computer vision algorithms. To achieve that, two main steps are incorporated. The first step registers the images with the underlying 4D BIM model. This means the discovery of the pose of each image of a sequence according to the coordinate system of the building model. Being aware of the image origin, it allows for the advanced interpretation of the content in consecutive processing. In the second step, the relevant tasks of the expected state of the 4D BIM model are projected onto the image space. The resulting image regions of interest are then taken as input for the determination of the activity state. The method is extensively tested in the experiment section of this paper. Since each consecutive process is based on the output of preceding steps, each process of the introduced method is tested for its standalone characteristics. In addition, the general manner of applicability is evaluated by means of two exemplary tasks as a concluding proof of the success of the novel method.

Different from people in other industries, construction workers are less sensitive to hazards because of their long-term exposure to risks. Therefore, maintaining construction workers’ vigilance and monitoring their attention levels are critical to successful safety management practices. However, current attention-assessing approaches are post hoc and subjective and difficult to implement in construction practice. To address these issues, we propose a wireless and wearable electroencephalography (EEG) system to quantitatively and automatically assess construction workers’ attention level through processing human brain signals. To validate the proposed system, we conducted an on-site experiment to analyze the EEG signal patterns when construction workers avoid different obstacles in their tasks. The results suggest EEG signal properties such as frequency, power spectrum density, and spatial distribution can effectively reflect and quantify the construction workers’ perceived risk level. Especially, lower gamma frequency bands and the frontal left EEG cluster provide the most direct and observable indications of their vigilance states. These conclusions could facilitate the future implementation of wearable EEG devices through data filtering and channel optimization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015013184

The high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections plus the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors urges development of automated BMS. Therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a key role towards automation in construction and corresponding management systems.

One of their goals is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their IFC interfaces that bind their native models to the IFC format. However, such exchanges frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid frameworks for validating a building design. This paper surveys six currently available applications for validating building design data and identifies their strengths and weaknesses: The Express Engine's EXPRESSO, the JDSAI™, the EXPRESS Data Manager™, the IFC server ActiveX Component, the IfcDoc, and the Solibri Model Checker®. We also structured the validation processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of compliance with the IFC schema defined by the EXPRESS language, 2) semantic and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions, which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner requirements, and functional performance. The purpose of this survey, based on available software that supports the validation of building model data for these three types of interoperability issues, is to integrate diverse checking approaches, as a basis for improving what are now widely distributed efforts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes and demonstrates a robust technique that uses the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema to automatically update an as-designed BIM based on site observations for inspected building elements. It receives as input an inspected object's actual type and inspection details including the detected defects/changes, responsible actors, as-built/as-is type, captured images, and time and the date of the inspection. The algorithm automatically analyzes the IFC data model to retrieve the element's semantics and identifies discrepancies between the as-built/as-is and as-designed object conditions. Based on the results of the discrepancy analysis, the IFC data model is populated with new semantics, resulting in the update of object types, properties, and three-dimensional (3D) shape representations.

Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provides a rich schema for interoperability through object-based transactions.

The objective of this research is to examine IFC from a perspective of an ontological framework, which can make the IFC definitions more formal, consistent and unambiguous. Different methods of ontological approaches to engineering knowledge are reviewed. Various issues such as the need for a logical framework, the current semantic approaches in the AEC/FM industry, and advantages of building an ontology structure are addressed. A comparative study of the ontology and segments of the existing IFC schema definition are performed. This exercise reveals the ambiguous nature of current IFC definitions and proposes reforms such that data exchanges would be more semantically robust.

Simulation-based DTs (SBDTs) are those based on online first-principles simulation models. In these systems, model parameter estimation techniques keep an online plant simulator in the same state as the targeted device or process. As a result, non-measured information of the current state of the plant can be obtained from the model. SBDTs can be used for a number of important applications and they have various advantages compared to DTs based on data-driven models. However, wider industrial adoption of SBDTs is hindered by laborious development of their underlying first-principles simulation model as well as by a lack of integrated lifecycle-wide implementation methods and simulation architectures. This paper focuses on applying previously presented methods for reducing implementation effort of SBDTs. Firstly, laborious simulation model development is tackled by applying an automatic model generation method. Secondly, an integrated implementation methodology of a lifecycle-wide online simulation architecture is followed for developing the SBDT.

This is particularly challenging for cost estimators, as they must quickly and accurately estimate the cost of the building when the design is still incomplete and evolving. State-of-the-art software tools typically use a rule-based approach to generate detailed quantities from the design details present in a building model and relate them to the cost items in a cost estimating database. In this paper, we propose a generic approach for creating and maintaining a cost estimate using flexible mappings between a building model and a cost estimate. The approach uses queries on the building design that are used to populate views, and each view is then associated with one or more cost items. The benefit of this approach is that the flexibility of modern query languages allows the estimator to encode a broad variety of relationships between the design and estimate. It also avoids the use of a common standard to which both designers and estimators must conform, allowing the estimator added flexibility and functionality to their work. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902187266

The work tasks of all these different co-builders need to be aligned to allow for the efficient delivery of the product. To allow for smooth alignment, all co-builders work together in the planning phase to rule out unwanted conflicts between work activities. Despite these efforts, many projects still accrue costs forced by on-site conflicts that were not anticipated beforehand and require costly improvisation to be resolved. The potential of 4D CAD models to avoid costly on-site improvisation by providing possibilities to anticipate conflicts better in the planning phase has been widely acknowledged. However, little empirical evidence exists that illustrate these benefits. This paper provides such evidence by providing in-depth narratives of how 4D CAD models helped to foresee conflicts on a major railway station renovation project in the Netherlands.

The capability to extract or deduce such quantitative properties from explicit and implicit model information is essential for bidding, procurement, production planning, and cost control activities in the AEC projects. Current solutions for quantity take off (QTO) and cost estimation (CE) are developed based on the assumptions that the design models are suitable, contain adequate information to perform these tasks efficiently and accurately. In practice often these criteria do not exist in the models that cost estimators receive. Many estimators, engineers and managers distrust BIM operations as a result or find it difficult to adopt a BIM-based preconstruction process. This leads to a cumbersome, manual and error-prone QT and CE process currently used by most construction companies. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we have developed a framework for a knowledge-based system to perform model based QTO and CE. This framework includes domain, reasoning, task and interface layers. This paper reports on the progress on an ongoing research effort which so far mostly focused on developing a domain layer and rule libraries for the reasoning layer. The domain layer contains a knowledge base which along with rule libraries were developed by acquiring and representing domain experts' knowledge. The rule libraries include modules of rules to infer knowledge about different product features. The inferred knowledge will enable providing and representing model information in a compatible format for QTO and CE tasks. It facilitates filtering, grouping and representing feature information provided in design models based on criteria that determines their true cost behavior. Finally, this knowledge will enable forecasting the properties of product features absent from design models. Examples are drawn from various fields inside and outside of the AEC industry, with a focus on the precast concrete industry.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912557611

Currently, MDO is developed with software tools that work together and automatically. However, the technical requisites to develop MDO using Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) platforms are not clearly specified in the design optimization literature. There are many difficulties not covered by the literature: especially the tools' behavior, and the strategies to deal with PIDO. To determine the technical requirements, the tools' behavior, the challenges of interoperability and viable strategies, we reviewed the literature and tested five tools. This paper presents the main behavior of the tools we studied, and explains the challenges and strategies to develop MDO through PIDO. We observed three technical tool requisites: component interoperability, tool automation, and model parameterization capabilities. We detected low openness levels of the tool interfaces that did not always enable a full integration with PIDO or permit access to model properties. The scarcity of commands and the presence of pop-up menus impeded performing analyses automatically. Moreover, most of the tools did not allow parametric associations among components, compatibility among themselves or the addition of custom components. The strategies proposed focused on testing the tool interfaces, to validate that each computational process runs automatically, and to confirm that parametric relationships and components are possible. The tools tested were not specifically designed to include full capability to work with PIDO, therefore, enhancements would be needed to meet the three requisites: component interoperability, automation and parameterization. Technological, documentation and programming challenges also emerged when working with tools. We demonstrated that only certain tools can be used with a PIDO platform. However, there may be still other requisites for MDO using different methods that can become the focus of future work. © 2016",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998996810

The environment consists of a series of interconnected multi-scale, multi-physics computational models linked to the real-world by data acquired during validation of prototypes, in-service monitoring and inspections of plant, post-shut-down inspections of plant and in-situ monitoring of stored waste. The technology gaps for the implementation of the integrated nuclear digital environment (INDE) are identified and discussed together with the advantages to be gained from its implementation. Implementation of INDE will be dependent on future advances in High Performance Computing systems approaching the exascale and parallel advances in the development of algorithms for processing large amounts of data. The data itself will be acquired through innovations in measurement, analysis and uncertainty and will be applied through projects relating to lifetime extension, decommissioning and resurgent national science programmes. It is postulated that the existence of this type of framework might be inevitable given both nuclear-specific and non-nuclear drivers and may be essential for the nuclear industry to deliver current and future challenges from the clean-up of legacy waste sites to time and budget, future generation nuclear reactors and small-scale mass-production of modular nuclear power plants. It is proposed that implementation of INDE will lead to shorten development times, reduced costs and increased credibility, operability, reliability and safety. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The current method is to develop BIM-R applications separately and represent the rules by coding or using proprietary formats, which has the problems of cost and efficiency. To solve these problems, a new method is proposed: to use a platform to rapidly develop BIM-R applications (BIM-R platform) based on ontology and freeware components. Thus, a BIM-R platform must be developed. This study establishes: 1) the functional requirements of the BIM-R platform, 2) the mechanism to transform BIM data into ontology data, and 3) the architecture of the BIM-R platform. This study also selects freeware components to develop the BIM-R platform. A BIM-R platform is implemented accordingly and applied to develop a prototype BIM-R application for the as-bid cost estimation of buildings for illustration.

The ability to observe the animated sequence of the construction process and track the construction status of each building component is just one of many possibilities offered by 4D modeling applications. However, as with the proliferation of any new technology, one of the inherent challenges with 4D modeling tools is a lack of agreed-upon visualization standards for representing building elements and tasks. Specifically, each tool typically has its own standards for viewing and navigating the model and schedule. Interviews with AEC professionals and experts provide insights from the end-user perspective of the current visualization methods along with their recommendations.

The basic idea of existing four-dimensional (4D) animation approaches is to establish a link between a construction task and the component where the task is executed. Tasks are defined in scheduling tools; components are defined in CAD tools. The use of three-dimensional (3D) CAD tools for the specification of components in combination with a schedule results in a 4D CAD environment where time represents the fourth dimension. A lot of investigations have been conducted, and 4D CAD is used more and more in civil engineering projects. However, the approaches described in literature accept the existence of traditional scheduling and traditional 3D CAD. Tasks are stored in scheduling tools; and components are stored in CAD tools. This paper presents the use of an approach for animating construction processes that has been originally developed for scheduling. The data model of this approach is described, and consequences of using this approach in the field of animating construction processes are discussed and illustrated. The approach has been tested in practice; and examples from real projects are presented. These examples show the power of the approach presented: the data management allows an efficient and suitable use of animating different kinds of information. Different kinds of projects require an animation of different kinds of information, and this can be done without any additional effort. However, the approach does not result in different animations compared to existing tools; the novelty results from the possibility to animate different kinds of information. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

There are many possible options for decommissioning offshore oil and gas platforms, and each decommissioning option can be implemented using different methods and technologies. Therefore, it is necessary to have a clear understanding and in-depth evaluation of each decommissioning option before commencing platform decommissioning. 4D and 5D building information modeling (BIM) has been commonly used in the building industry to analyze constructability and to evaluate different construction or demolition plans. However, application of BIM in the oil and gas industry, especially for the platform decommissioning process, is still limited. Methods: This paper suggests and demonstrates the application of 4D and 5D BIM technology to simulate various methodologies to realize various selected offshore platform decommissioning options, thereby visualizing and evaluating different options, considering both the time and resources required for decommissioning process. One hundred and seventy-seven offshore platform decommissioning options are summarized in this paper. A new approach to create multiple 4D/5D BIM models in a semi-automated manner for evaluating various scenario options of OOGP decommissioning was proposed to reduce the model creation time as current way of 4D/5D BIM model creation for each OOGP decommissioning option is time consuming. Results: In the proposed approach, an OOGP BIM model relationship database that contains possible 4D/5D BIM model relationships (i.e. schedules for different decommissioning methods) for different parts of an OOGP was generated. Different OOGP decommissioning options can be simulated and visualized with 4D/5D BIM models created by automatically matching schedules, resources, cost information and 3D BIM models. This paper also presents an illustrative example of the proposed approach, which simulates and evaluates two decommissioning options of a fixed jacket platform, namely Rig-to-Reef and Removal-to-Shore. As compared to the traditional approach of 4D/5D BIM model generation, the proposed semi-automated approach reduces the model generation time by 58.8% in the illustrative example. Conclusions: The proposed approach of semi-automated 4D/5D BIM model creation can help understand the implication of different decommissioning options as well as applied methods, detecting potential lifting clashes, and reducing 4D/5D BIM model creation time, leading to better planning and execution for the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas platforms. In addition, with the proposed semi-automated approach, the 4D/5D BIM model can be generated in a more efficient manner. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041490433

Due to the logical interconnections of BIM objects and construction tasks, flexible schedules and visual representations of construction processes are automatically generated without permanent human interaction. © ASCE 2014.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934276728

It is associated with the authoring, use and quality control in relation with the management of digital information models produced in so-called BIM projects. 3D coordination is an emergent business involving new practices, contractual standards and associated devices and software, thus requiring appropriate research approaches involving the understanding of Information Technology in human environments to address it. Based on a prospective ergonomics methodology, the authors analyse the synchronous co-located 3D coordination meeting and focus on three research questions: 1) What is the current 3D coordination task?, 2) How are the usual interaction and visualization devices supporting synchronous co-located 3D coordination meeting perceived by users?, and 3) How could a new 3D coordination meeting support system strengthen collaborative decision-making process in synchronous co-located context? A survey, followed by a controlled laboratory experiment, provides results on the conceptualization of the BIM coordination process as well as on the devices that will support the related synchronous co-located meetings. The findings highlight the usefulness of touch-based and multi-users displays for a better engagement of teams.

The 3D models within these change color according to changes in the corresponding construction schedule. Color schemes play a crucial role in the design and representation of a 4D model. Good color schemes enhance an engineer's understanding of the situation at hand. Therefore, this research aims to develop effective and affordable tools for selecting and evaluating color schemes in 4D models. We proposed a two-step method of color selection. The first step is to determine the number of construction statuses and their relationships with each other. The second step is to select the colors to fit these statuses. In this research, we also developed three types of simulators to facilitate color evaluation. The display simulator is the first type of simulator developed and includes a LED monitor simulator, a projector simulator, and a printout simulator. The second type of simulator is the viewer simulator, which simulates protanopic blindness and tritanope blindness. The third type of simulator is the rendering simulator. This simulates the rendering results from the two major 3D viewers: NavisWorks and SmartPlant Review. Using the two-step selection method and the three types of simulators, we identified 21 color schemes (3 for 3 statuses, 12 for 5 statuses, and 6 for 6 statuses) ideal for presenting 4D models. We summarized our experiences by providing six guidelines for color selections. The color schemes and simulators were also implemented as a reference tool on a website (http://4Dcolor.caece.net). Future 4D model builders can refer to this website to select the color scheme that is most appropriate for their projects. © 2013 The authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876904672

Gathering a maximum of information from different sources to oversee the current situation is a complex task due to the diversity of data formats and structures. Although several approaches have been designed to integrate data from different sources into an ontology, they mainly require background knowledge of the data. However, non-standard data set schema (NSDS) of relational geospatial data retrieved from e.g. web feature services are not always documented. This lack of background knowledge is a major challenge for automatic semantic data integration. Focusing on this problem, this article presents an automatic approach for geospatial data integration in NSDS. This approach does a schema mapping according to the result of an ontology matching corresponding to a semantic interpretation process. This process is based on geocoding and natural language processing. This article extends work done in a previous publication by an improved unit detection algorithm, data quality and provenance enrichments, the detection of feature clusters. It also presents an improved evaluation process to better assess the performance of this approach compared to a manually created ontology.

This chapter reflects a contemporary shift in thinking and analyzing the information overload phenomenon from an organizational perspective. Indeed, organizations tend to act as incubators for information overload. As people in organizations try to cope with increasing amounts of information, they become less capable of identifying the most critical bits of information, distinguishing accurate information from that which is not accurate, and making decisions that are sensible for organizations. Based on literature review and meta-analysis of contemporary research, this chapter examines the primary effects of information overload in organizations, including implications on individual work performance, knowledge transfer, decision making, and, ultimately, organizational effectiveness. A practical approach to minimizing information overload within organizations is explored within this chapter. Specifically, the principles of strategic communication practiced by public relations specialists and other professional communicators may help keep organizations from drowning in data. Traditionally, disseminating information within an organization had been the domain of those in charge of public relations, employee communications, human resources, and/or operations. However, nearly anyone within an organization now has that kind of power, via e-mail and other technologies. Training and coaching individuals within the organization to use strategic communication principles may help people throughout the organization focus on meaningful data, make sound decisions, and improve performance. © 2012 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886359989

Despite of the well agreed benefits of using BIM in the operations to improve maintenance planning and control, ensure speed up of FM hand over from construction or improve start-up management of building operations to name three of them, serious obstacles for practical use of BIM in FM must be considered. Just to mention two of them, today accepted standards helping FM organization to setup their BIM requirements according to different BIM uses are missing or As-Built information of existing buildings to setup digital building model needed for BIM are not available. The lack of exiting (3D) digital building models in FM will not change quickly; far more the 90 % of the buildings to be operated and maintained in FM business are existing buildings. The acquisition of As-Built information may be simplified by digital surveying methods (e.g. 3D Laser Scanning, Aerial photo capturing by Surveying Drone), but there is still an enormous amount of effort for parametric modelling needed to setup digital building models for FM, which cannot be achieved by typical FM organizations today.

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976428115

An emerging approach in the construction industry is the use of 5D-BIM, by combining the traditional three dimensions of a BIM with the schedule as the fourth dimension and cost estimate as the fifth dimension [3]. This approach allows the contractors to better predict the cost of the project, the time-line of the project when these expenses are anticipated to occur, while simultaneously allowing the schedule to be optimized by considering the quantities of materials derived from the model and the productivity rate of construction crews. On the one hand 5D-BIM methods provide an excellent opportunity to connect processes in design, cost and construction methods; on the other hand they call for a significant shift in the way construction companies operate. It is unrealistic to commit extensive resources for a large construction company, towards a re-alignment of their internal processes, while continuing to be competitive and profitable. This paper considers how one construction company in the United States adopted the 5D-BIM methods, the challenges faced in implementing it within the company and the lessons learned in the process. A case-study method was used in an effort to understand the paradigm shift within the company in adopting 5D-BIM. Interviews with key personnel within the company were conducted and content analysis of the data was performed to describe the results. The results from this study show the intricacies of implementing a technology driven paradigm shift to a population of construction experts with a not-so erstwhile philosophy of success within the construction industry. The captains within the company communicated a great appreciation for the 5D-BIM concepts but were unwilling to delve into it whole-heartedly. Several reasons contributed to this attitude, including a reluctance to change by some, motivation to demonstrate immediate profitability and the lack of demand for such endeavours from the owner/designer community. However there were also personnel within the company that quickly adapted to the 5D way of thinking about construction and were keen to proceed with using the methodology on future projects.

This paper proposes a novel 4D-based method for life cyclic integration, modeling, and visualization of infrastructure data. Such temporal integration of infrastructure data is particularly crucial due to the ever-increasing demand for maintaining the infrastructure assets in the United States, with approximately 188 million trips occurring across the nation’s structurally deficient bridges. The proposed approach takes the application of 4D technology beyond the construction phase and demonstrates its effectiveness for life cyclic modeling and visualization of infrastructures’ data including condition assessments. In this approach, various data categories such as inspection reports, maintenance schedules and costs, degradation models, operation schedules, and elements’ semantics are integrated with 3D models and using 4D technology, bringing the notion of time and space to infrastructure data; this enables the spatio-temporal exploration and modeling of data at an element level; this is not currently achievable since the existing solutions connect and display just one set of temporal data for one level of detail of a structure. The introduced technique also visualizes the data using a color-coding scheme and provides customized query and information retrieval support. In addition, degradation models can be integrated with the 4D-based system to simulate the condition ratings over time. The technique has been implemented and demonstrated for bridge infrastructure; it has been evaluated in two case study bridges in the state of California, United States, and has shown promise for use in real-life applications. The technique was observed to become more effective with increase in the complexity of maintenance tasks and infrastructure models; it increased the accuracy of maintenance tasks by 20-40% and reduced their duration by 30-50%. © 2018 The author(s).",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060079729

Four of these principles supported our hypotheses that 4D allows managers to anticipate and contain errors better.

For this purpose, a BIM (Building Information Modelling)-centred framework has been designed, where BIM contains all the static information modelled from the building, including sensors. A dynamic database is modelled under the IFC paradigm to be able to link data between both repositories and, thus, keep record of dynamic data that the building periodically generates. With the aim of demonstrating its functionality, CARTIF-III building has been used where, on one hand, BIM model deals with thermal zones and sensors. On the other hand, dynamic database stores data coming from the “modelled” sensors, as well as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Previous research has acknowledged the benefit of 4D models in the project planning and construction phases enhancing communication between construction teams and avoiding unforeseen conflicts during the build process. The development of BIM has spurred a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding Level of Development, Level of Information (LOI) and Level of Detail (LOD) pertaining to the graphical detail and non-graphical information of the static geometric design model. However, to date there is limited research thoroughly investigating the issue of LOD within 4D applications. This work presents an ongoing study to derive a framework for the development of more dynamic 4D simulations incorporating discrete forms of LOD. Level of graphical detail (LODg) corresponds to the graphical detail of the model geometry and also the 'granularity' of the geometry required for dynamic 4D production, whilst the temporal level of detail (LODti) relates to time period required between state changes in the model during the simulation. In order to support the development of the framework, an industry-based survey was conducted to assess the application of 4D, subsequent issues and use cases around levels of graphical and temporal details to improve dynamic 4D simulations. The work concludes with the development of a framework and schematic to support the specification of the LOD of a 4D simulation (LOD4d) throughout the various phases of a construction project. © 2019 The author(s).
