The research finds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7 €cent/kWh; 6-11.1 €cent/kWh when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most influencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20% over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-à-vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R&D in new materials, O&M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money.

In this paper, a review of Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS) for offshore wind turbines (OWT) has been carried out considering the topic as a Statistical Pattern Recognition problem. Therefore, each one of the stages of this paradigm has been reviewed focusing on OWT application. These stages are: Operational Evaluation; Data Acquisition, Normalization and Cleansing; Feature Extraction and Information Condensation; and Statistical Model Development. It is expected that optimizing each stage, SHMS can contribute to the development of efficient Condition-Based Maintenance Strategies. Optimizing this strategy will help reduce labor costs of OWTs' inspection, avoid unnecessary maintenance, identify design weaknesses before failure, improve the availability of power production while preventing wind turbines' overloading, therefore, maximizing the investments' return. In the forthcoming years, a growing interest in SHM technologies for OWT is expected, enhancing the potential of offshore wind farm deployments further offshore.

This industry requires high levels of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) for wind turbines. The blades are critical components in wind turbines. The objective of this research work is focused on the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of the wind turbine blades. The FDD approach is composed of a robust condition monitoring system (CMS) and a novel signal processing method. CMS collects and analyses the data from different non-destructive tests based on acoustic emission. The acoustic emission signals are collected applying macro-fiber composite (MFC) sensors to detect and locate cracks on the surface of the blades. Three MFC sensors are set in a section of a wind turbine blade. The acoustic emission signals are generated by breaking a pencil lead in the blade surface. This method is used to simulate the acoustic emission due to a breakdown of the composite fibers. The breakdown generates a set of mechanical waves that are collected by the MFC sensors. A graphical method is employed to obtain a system of non-linear equations that will be used for locating the emission source. This work demonstrates that a fiber breakage in the wind turbine blade can be detected and located by using only three low cost sensors.

The measured displacement was variable around the circumference of the foundation as a result of the wind direction and the rotor uplift forces. The excessive vertical movement was observed in the side where the rotor is rotating upwards. The field test demonstrated that the SIM technique offers great potential for improving the reliability and safety of wind turbine foundations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930966008

This paper presents a novel delamination classification approach for reliability monitoring systems in wind turbine blades. It is based on the feature extraction of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input system (NARX) and linear auto-regressive model (AR). A novelty in this paper is NARX as a Feature Extraction method for wind turbine blade delamination classification. Further, the NARX feature is demonstrated to be significantly better than linear AR feature for blade damage detection, and NARX can describe the inherent nonlinearity of blade delamination correctly. A real case study considers different levels of delamination employing ultrasonic guided waves that are sensitive to delamination. Firstly, the signals obtained are filtered and de-noised by wavelet transforms. Then, the features of the signal are extracted by NARX, and the number of features is selected considering the Neighbourhood Component Analysis as main novelties. Finally, six scenarios with different delamination sizes have been performed by supervised Machine Learning methods: Decision Trees, Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbours and Ensemble Classification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068145374

Bottom-fixed foundations are the most used foundation type. Because of its large diameter, the foundation is sensitive to wave loads. For typical manually assisted blade-mating operations, the decision to perform the mating operation is based on the relative distance and velocity between the blade root center and the hub, and in accordance with the weather window. Hence, monitoring the hub real-time position and velocity is necessary, whether the blade installation is conducted manually or automatically. In this study, we design a hub motion estimation algorithm for the OWT with a bottom-fixed foundation using sensor fusion of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Two schemes are proposed based on a moving horizon estimator, a multirate Kalman filter, an online smoother, and a predictor. The moving horizon estimator mitigates the slow GNSS sampling rate relative to the hub dynamics. The multirate Kalman filter estimates the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias with a constant GNSS measurement delay. The online smoothing algorithm filters the delayed estimated trajectory to remove sudden step changes. The predictor compensates the delayed estimate, resulting in real-time monitoring. HAWC2 and MATLAB are used to verify the performance of the estimation algorithms, showing that a sufficiently accurate real-time position and velocity estimate with a high sampling rate is achieved. A sensitivity study compares the accuracy of different algorithms applied in various conditions. By combining both proposed algorithms, a sufficiently accurate estimation can be achieved for a wider scope of practical applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060092214

The numerical-sensor signals are simulated using a time-domain turbine-floater-mooring fully-coupled dynamic simulation computer program.

One of the critical wind turbine components is the gearbox. Failures in the gearbox are costly both due to the cost of the gearbox itself and also due to high repair downtime. In order to detect faults as fast as possible to prevent them to develop into failure, statistical change detection is used in this paper. The Cumulative Sum Method (CUSUM) is employed to detect possible defects in the downwind main bearing. A high fidelity gearbox model on a 5-MW spar-type wind turbine is used to generate data for fault-free and faulty conditions of the bearing at the rated wind speed and the associated wave condition. Acceleration measurements are utilized to find residuals used to indirectly detect damages in the bearing.

Special attention has been given to land-based turbines for ensuring the efficient economical operation of massive hubs rising 100m above the ground, based on the idea that the bigger the turbine, the more complicated are the transportation and assembly processes. Methods: A new design of a wind turbine has several advantages compared to conventional designs; one of these advantages lies in the use of prefabricated elements, which increases efficiency. The implementation of information technology as a complement to prefabrication techniques is a further aim of this research, which seeks to improve the overall performance of the project. Consequently, Building Information Modelling is suggested as the most suitable methodology for complementing off-site techniques and reaching higher efficiency by improving design, manufacture, transportation and assembly processes. Results: This paper will present the research project “hybrid² tower for wind turbines” funded by the State of Hesse, Germany, which focuses on a new, efficient and economical design for high wind turbine towers. The new hybrid² tower is composed of a concrete tower containing prefabricated concrete quarter-circle elements, steel beams and a steel tube tower on the top. The combination of concrete and steel beams improves the static and dynamic performance of the main supporting structure. With this new design, the weight of the concrete tower is estimated to decrease by 40 % compared to a traditional full-concrete tower and, as a positive consequence, the cost of assembly (including assembly on site) is reduced. Conclusions: Due to the energy revolution, a special focus is put on the development of renewable energies, especially wind power. The steadily increasing hub heights of wind turbines means that tower structures have to be more massive. The development of the hybrid² tower by using Building Information Modeling and prefabrication techniques leads to an optimized performance and reduces transport and assembly costs. © 2016, Alvarez-Anton et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031725689

Therefore, detecting the potential faults for prediction of its failure has become indispensable for condition-based maintenance and operation of wind turbines. This paper presents an approach to wind turbine converter fault detection using convolutional neural network models which are developed by using wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data. The approach starts with the selection of fault indicator variables, and then the fault indicator variables data are extracted from a wind turbine SCADA system. Using the data, radar charts are generated, and the convolutional neural network models are applied to feature extraction from the radar charts and characteristic analysis of the feature for fault detection. Based on the analysis of the Octave Convolution (OctConv) network structure, an improved AOctConv (Attention Octave Convolution) structure is proposed in this paper, and it is applied to the ResNet50 back-bone network (named as AOC–ResNet50). It is found that the algorithm based on AOC–ResNet50 overcomes the issues of information asymmetry caused by the asymmetry of the sampling method and the damage to the original features in the high and low frequency domains by the OctConv structure. Finally, the AOC–ResNet50 network is employed for fault detection of the wind turbine converter using 10 min SCADA system data. It is verified that the fault detection accuracy using the AOC–ResNet50 network is up to 98.0%, which is higher than the fault detection accuracy using the ResNet50 and Oct–ResNet50 networks. Therefore, the effectiveness of the AOC–ResNet50 network model in wind turbine converter fault detection is identified. The novelty of this paper lies in a novel AOC–ResNet50 network proposed and its effectiveness in wind turbine fault detection.

Recent trends in offshore wind have seen the installation of turbines in deeper and more remote waters due to the presence of stronger and more consistent wind resources. This has led to the development of floating foundations for turbine mounting in water depths above 40 m, where conventional bottom-fixed foundations are not considered economically feasible. However, due to its emerging nature, floating wind must attain market maturity to be considered cost competitive. It is a widely accepted belief that market expansion yields technological maturity. Therefore, this paper adopts a systems approach to investigate the viability of floating offshore wind power generation in Scotland and South Africa. It does this through a content analysis of relevant secondary documentation, including policy documents, industry reports, press releases, online publications, and databases to determine the drivers and barriers of floating wind in the case contexts. The key findings are that substantial technical potential is required to attract floating wind investments, political support is necessary in order to scale up, a strong offshore wind supply chain could cushion the high-cost effects of floating wind projects, and more innovative business models such as corporate Power Purchasing Agreements could serve as social drivers for such projects. The main contextual conclusions drawn from this paper are that Scotland's inaugural floating wind projects benefitted from the Scottish government's Renewable Obligation scheme, however its discontinuation threatens the prospects of future projects. Alternatively, South Africa's technical potential, coupled with its government's healthy appetite for renewable energy development, could see the take up of this technology in the near future, with corresponding benefits for more sustainable energy in densely populated areas, compliant with SDG 7. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094936938

The purpose is then twofold: first, to provide a stochastic spatial model of the bio-colonisation on a mooring line; second, to show that in some defined environmental conditions, such as low wave height, low wind and current velocities, the monitoring of mooring lines tension can help to assess and reduce uncertainty on this model. Therefore, a comprehensive stochastic modelling based on mussels colonisation was carried out using on-site videotapes, experimental campaigns and expert knowledge. We studied the efficiency of a virtual sensing network using this model and a conditional entropy metric. It is first shown that the spatial model fits well with experimental data, and second that a denser medium accuracy sensor network is to be preferred to a single high accuracy fairlead sensor to reduce the uncertainty on the model parameters.

The mooring lines, production risers and umbilicals are connected to the turret and therefore remain stationary as the FPSO weathervanes. During the design phase of the FPSO mooring system, a wide range of factors are considered, including location and environmental conditions. Although they are designed to withstand 100-year storms, very few FPSO mooring systems have much reserve capacity above what is required to withstand them. The deterioration of mooring lines over time can lead to an increase in the failure of single or multiple lines. If the deterioration or failure of a single mooring line is not detected, multiple line failure can occur in the next instance of severe weather as a result of increased load on the remaining lines exceeding the design limits.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872294829

The floater-mooring-coupled hydro-elastic time-domain numerical simulations are conducted under various random wave excitations and failure/intact scenarios. Then, the big-data is collected at various locations of numerical motion sensors along the SFT to be used for the present DNN algorithm. In the input layer, tunnel motion-sensor signals and wave conditions are inputted while the output layer provides the probabilities of 21 failure scenarios. In the optimization stage, the numbers of hidden layers, neurons of each layer, and epochs for reliable performance are selected. Several activation functions and optimizers are also tested for the present DNN model, and Sigmoid function and Adamax are respectively adopted to enhance the classification accuracy. Moreover, a systematic sensitivity test with respect to the numbers and arrangements of sensors is performed to find the appropriate sensor combination to achieve target prediction accuracy. The technique of confusion matrix is used to represent the accuracy of the DNN algorithms for various cases, and the classification accuracy as high as 98.1% is obtained with seven sensors. The results of this study demonstrate that the DNN model can effectively monitor the mooring failures of SFTs utilizing real-time sensor signals. © 2020 by the authors.

The use of such models is key to understanding complex loading phenomena experienced during testing of vertical axis wind turbines. Unsteady aerodynamic and structural effects such as dynamic stall and dynamically changing thrust and blade loading are difficult to predict with certainty. This leads to inefficient turbine designs or worse yet premature failures. Many of these phenomena can be better understood through scaled wind tunnel testing. The analysis of these test results is greatly improved by having a well calibrated digital twin model of the turbine. This paper discusses the methodologies used in the development of the model for a H style vertical axis wind turbine. This includes physical measurements of the as built system, updates to the models based upon experimental testing and a final correlation between test and model on a component by component as well as fully assembled system. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Co-designing lighter less expensive FOWTs with individual pitch control (IPC) of each blade could increase efficiencies, decreases costs, and make offshore wind economically viable. However, the nonlinear dynamics and breadth of nonstationary wind and wave loading present challenges to designing effective and robust IPC for each desired location and situation.This manuscript presents the development, design, and simulation of machine learning control (MLC) for IPC of FOWTs. MLC has been shown effective for many complex nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problems. This project investigates scaling up these component-level control problems to the system level control of the NREL 5MW OC3 FOWT. A massively parallel genetic program (GP) is developed using MATLAB Simulink and OpenFAST that efficiently evaluates new individuals and selectively tests fitness of each generation in the most challenging design load case. The proposed controller was compared to a baseline PID controller using a cost function that captured the value of annual energy production with maintenance costs correlated to ultimate loads and harmonic fatigue. The proposed controller achieved 67% of the cost of the baseline PID controller, resulting in 4th place in the ARPA-E ATLAS Offshore competition for IPC of the OC3 FOWT for the given design load cases. © 2020 AACC.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089580645

There are numerous sources in literature describing challenges with mooring systems as well as potential solutions. The goal of this paper is to present a number of new technologies which can be applied jointly in an integrated framework to monitor integrity of subsea mooring components. The paper will cover (1) direct tension measurements using Vibrating Wire Gauges, (2) warning systems based on anomaly detections from GPS measurements and (3) mooring line force estimation method and fatigue using time-domain simulation methods. Vibrating Wire Gauges are a potential alternative to the use of in-line load cells or inclinometers for measuring mooring line tensions. These sensors have a proven track record in the Geotechnical Industry. A sensor dedicated for the offshore industry has been developed. The main benefit of this type of sensor is the ease of retrofitting in an offshore environment. Long-term stability tests and dynamic tests were executed and will be presented. Procedures for installation and maintenance were developed. GPS measurements have widely been used in the industry to identify mooring failures. Post-processing methods of these measurements range from application of watch circles to Artificial Neural Networks. However, there remain important challenges with performance of these warning systems under the influence of environmental loads. The authors will show a basic concept which can overcome these limitations. High accuracy floater position and motion measurements can be used in combination with a numerical model to determine mooring line forces in the field. This approach combines the numerical models used in the design with onboard integrity and maintenance procedures. The technical and organisational challenges of such approach are discussed. An onboard system able to capture system drift is used to update the numerical model and correct for deterioration of the mooring system over time. In-service measurements have been used to demonstrate and validate the concept. The methodology has been implemented and installed on an offshore asset which will become active in Q1 2019. A number of industry solutions for mooring line integrity methods have been compared. All presented solutions have a role in the total mooring subsea integrity management program. Integration of these components together or supplemented with numerical analysis can be used to develop an overall mooring subsea integrity management plan and philosophy.

In this field, one of the most important and less analyzed stages of the marine works is the sinking process of the floating caissons. The test campaign presented in this work is innovative in scale (1:12) and includes an analysis of the different stages of a floating caisson during its life cycle: detached concrete caisson, caisson positioning and sinking and berthed floating caisson, resulting in more than 130 tests performed. Movements and tensions have been analyzed for a wide array of sea states and different configurations of mooring systems and horizontal layouts. A new tool for dynamic positioning control was designed and developed as part of the test campaign. The design of this tool has led to the development of a specific numerical model that reproduced the dynamic behavior during sinking. The dynamic positioning control was implemented in the physical model campaign, which has meant an important advance in the construction process of maritime infrastructures. Moreover, the campaign carried out has allowed the validation and calibration of the tools developed, allowing all the work to reduce costs and increase the safety of these types of marine operations. © 2018 ASME.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055415089

One of the first steps to be undertaken is the development of floating structures to support either wind turbines or measurement devices for the proper characterization of wind energy resources. The use of floating devices for measuring wind speed involves a number of uncertainties not presented by seabed fixed systems. These sources of uncertainty or error are present both in instantaneous wind measurements and averaged (10 min or hourly) values because of (i) variability in the measurement height, (ii) the tilt of the anemometer and (iii) the relative velocity between the anemometer and the wind, among others. In this paper, a methodology for assessing the error in the wind measurement characterization because of the movement of a floating meteorological mast is presented. By the numerical simulation of a floating mast, the short- and long-term error in the characterization of the wind at different heights has been evaluated. In general, the error because of the tilt can reach up to 80% of the total error; the error because of the variation of the vertical position of the anemometer reaches values of up to 15% in some cases; moreover, the error associated with the relative velocity between the anemometer and the wind, for averaged values, is significantly less. Finally, it can be concluded that the total error is lower than 0.5% for 10 min averaged wind speed of up to 24 m/s. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
