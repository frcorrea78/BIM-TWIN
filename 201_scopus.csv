ISPRS Working Group III/3 conducted a test to determine the performance of these filters and the influence of point density thereon, and to identify directions for future research. Twelve selected datasets have been processed by eight participants. In this paper, the test results are presented. The paper describes the characteristics of the provided datasets and the used filter approaches. The filter performance is analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. All filters perform well in smooth rural landscapes, but all produce errors in complex urban areas and rough terrain with vegetation. In general, filters that estimate local surfaces are found to perform best. The influence of point density could not well be determined in this experiment. Future research should be directed towards the usage of additional data sources, segment-based classification, and self-diagnosis of filter algorithms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications. The classified inventory could be useful for scientists as well as stakeholders in the geospatial industry, such as companies and national mapping agencies, as it may serve as a reference document to better position their operations, design product portfolios, and to better understand the market. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952802912

The concept is in practice principally used to indicate the geometric detail of a model, primarily of buildings. Despite the popularity and the general acceptance of this categorisation, we argue in this paper that from a geometric point of view the five LODs are insufficient and that their specification is ambiguous.We solve these shortcomings with a better definition of LODs and their refinement. Hereby we present a refined set of 16 LODs focused on the grade of the exterior geometry of buildings, which provide a stricter specification and allow less modelling freedom. This series is a result of an exhaustive research into currently available 3D city models, production workflows, and capabilities of acquisition techniques. Our specification also includes two hybrid models that reflect common acquisition practices. The new LODs are in line with the LODs of CityGML 2.0, and are intended to supplement, rather than replace the geometric part of the current specification. While in our paper we focus on the geometric aspect of the models, our specification is compatible with different levels of semantic granularity. Furthermore, the improved LODs can be considered format-agnostic.Among other benefits, the refined specification could be useful for companies for a better definition of their product portfolios, and for researchers to specify data requirements when presenting use cases of 3D city models. We support our refined LODs with experiments, proving their uniqueness by showing that each yields a different result in a 3D spatial operation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977489262

Camera configuration indeed poses a challenge on the traditional photogrammetric pipeline used in commercial software but, on the other hand, gives the opportunity to exploit the additional information provided by the oblique views and allows a more reliable feature extraction. In particular, the information that can be provided in correspondence of building façades can open new possibilities for the building detection and footprint extraction. In this paper, a methodology for the automated extraction of building footprints from oblique imagery is presented.

The GeoBIM benchmark 2019, funded by ISPRS and EuroSDR, evaluated the state of implementation of tools addressing some of those issues. In particular, in the part of the benchmark described in this paper, the application of georeferencing to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models and making consistent conversions between 3D city models and BIM are investigated, considering the OGC CityGML and buildingSMART IFC as reference standards. In the benchmark, sample datasets in the two reference standards were provided. External volunteers were asked to describe and test georeferencing procedures for IFC models and conversion tools between CityGML and IFC. From the analysis of the delivered answers and processed datasets, it was possible to notice that while there are tools and procedures available to support georeferencing and data conversion, comprehensive definition of the requirements, clear rules to perform such two tasks, as well as solid technological solutions implementing them, are still lacking in functionalities.

Moreover, a continuous and seamless full LoD (FLoD) set obtained by combining various OLoDs and ILoDs is subsequently listed to realize the full specification for 3D building models.

This study identifies obstacles to version management of 3D city models and proposes recommendations to overcome them, with a main focus on the municipality perspective, foremost in the planning and building processes. As part of this study, we investigate whether national building registers can control the version management of 3D city models. A case study based on investigations of standards, interviews and a review of tools is presented. The study uses an architectural model divided into four layers: data collection, building theme, city model and application. All layers require changes when implementing a new versioning method: the data collection layer requires restructuring of technical solutions and work processes, storage of the national building register requires restructuring, versioning capabilities must be propagated to the city model layer, and tools at the application layer must handle temporal information better. Strong incentives for including versioning in 3D city models are essential, as substantial investment is required to implement versioning in all the layers. Only capabilities required by applications should be implemented, as the complexity grows with the number of versioning functionalities. One outcome of the study is a recommendation to link 3D city models more closely to building registers. This enables more complex use in, e.g., building permits and 3D cadastres, and authorities can fetch required (versioning) information directly from the city model layer. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106524573

This is determined by the complication of the procedure for designing and building the cadastral real estate objects. Modern architecture is becoming more complex and diverse year-by-year. The configuration of the construction facilities is becoming more increasingly complex, and these days, they can be built not only on the ground surface but also above or under the ground. In practice, such design solutions lead to uncertainty and ambiguity of their routine cadastral registration, and these objects are registered according to their two-dimensional projection on the ground. Currently, almost all design agencies use 3D simulation in solving issues related to the design, construction, and sale of both industrial or agricultural facilities and residential or office buildings and apartments.
