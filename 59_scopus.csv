BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619234

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

This paper particularly considers the case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find, recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds automatically. Previous research has also shown that ""Scan-vs-BIM"" systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works, thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking, automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and identification metric. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, generation of such models currently is mostly performed manually, and errors can be introduced during data collection, pre-processing, and modeling. This paper presents a method for assessing the quality of as-is BIMs generated from point cloud data by analyzing the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point cloud data. The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the depiction of the components and their spatial attributes. Major geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate potential errors introduced during data collection, processing and/or model generation. The research described in this paper provides a taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source, magnitude, and nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns. The method is validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical measurement method in a case study. The results show that the deviation analysis method is capable of identifying almost six times more errors with more than 40% time savings compared to the physical measurement method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884502984

In today's construction industry, there is an increasing demand for modularization of prefabricated components and control of their dimensional quality during the fabrication and assembly stages. To meet these needs, this study develops a non-contact dimensional quality assurance (DQA) technique that automatically and precisely assesses the key quality criteria of full-scale precast concrete elements. First, a new coordinate transformation algorithm is developed taking into account the scales and complexities of real precast slabs so that the DQA technique can be fully automated. Second, a geometry matching method based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which relates the as-built model constructed from the point cloud data to the corresponding as-designed BIM model, is utilized for precise dimension estimations of the actual precast slab. Third, an edge and corner extraction algorithm is advanced to tackle issues encountered in unexpected conditions, i.e. large incident angles and external steel bars being located near the edge of precast concrete elements. Lastly, a BIM-assisted storage and delivery approach for the obtained DQA data is proposed so that all relevant project stakeholders can share and update DQA data through the manufacture and assembly stages of the project. The applicability of the proposed DQA technique is validated through field tests on two full-scale precast slabs, and the associated implementation issues are discussed. Field test results reveal that the proposed DQA technique can achieve a measurement accuracy of around 3.0 mm for dimension and position estimations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995487486

In recent years, various scanning technologies were applied with different success. The general finding is that a higher quality of the point cloud leads to improved monitoring results. Most published works in the relevant area recognise density and accuracy as the main quality parameters of a point cloud. Data quality has been addressed in various ways, by defining arbitrary levels of quality parameters, by evaluating the quality parameters of a point cloud, and by defining parameters of a scanning plan in order to achieve a desired level of quality. However, the relation between the levels of point cloud quality and the success of Scan-vs-BIM element identification is still an open question. This paper presents results of a research in which we defined a more accurate and applicable metric for evaluation of the quality of a point cloud for construction progress monitoring using a Scan-vs-BIM method. The proposed methodology includes the definition of building element classes and the definition of point cloud quality parameters, which have been selected by observing the most significant criteria that influence the success of building element identification. Using a test BIM, around hundred point clouds have been generated with combinations of influencing parameter values. A statistical method was applied to determine the point cloud quality criteria for assuring correct identification of each class of elements. The quality criteria were then validated using three different scanning methods. Results show that the defined quality criteria can be effectively applied in deciding on the appropriate scanning methodology for successful Scan-vs-BIM identification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030318234

Instead, a fully automatic room segmentation and outlier removal is performed on the unstructured point clouds. Second, restricting the solution space of our optimization approach to arrangements of volumetric wall entities representing the structure of a building enforces a consistent model of volumetric, interconnected walls fitted to the observed data instead of unconnected, paper-thin surfaces.

After delivery at construction sites, defective spools must be detected and further consideration given to the erection of the spools to tolerance levels specified; otherwise, the repair and realignment associated with rework can cause schedule delays and consequent substantial costs increases. This paper presents an automated approach for monitoring and assessing fabricated pipe spools using automated scan-to-BIM registration. Defects are detected through a neighborhood-based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach for the registration process.

Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s.

Occlusions and construction progress prevent a laser scan performed at a single point in time to capture a complete view of building components. Progressively scanning a building during the construction phase and combining the progressively captured point cloud data together can provide the geometric information missing in the point cloud data captured previously. However, combining all point cloud data will result in large file sizes and might not always guarantee additional building component information. This paper provides the details of an approach developed to help engineers decide on which progressively captured point cloud data to combine in order to get more geometric information and eliminate large file sizes due to redundant point clouds. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema. A case study using part of an office building and the results of its analysis are provided and discussed from the perspectives of applicability and accuracy. Future works and limitations are also addressed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082486835

Subsequently, rework is required during on-site subassembly aggregation. Rework and tampering with prefabricated parts has implications including suboptimal structural/non-structural performance, delays and increased costs. Currently there is a gap in the off-site construction literature in developing effective interventions to reflect on variability in operations of subassembly manufacturers. On this basis, and in the first step of the current research, point clouds of the as-built status of parts are generated by laser scanners and compared with the as-designed status represented by Building Information models (BIM). Then, optimization modelling is used for development of a balanced penalty and incentive (PI) scheme to minimize variability. For this purpose, total expenditure on variability reduction is offset by revenues generated from penalties on poor quality. This optimization-based research contributes to the off-site construction literature by providing cost-effective solutions to quality problems. Furthermore, models and findings are of practical importance to off-site manufacturers by encouraging precision and discouraging discrepancy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066983785

To successfully install MEP modules on-site, performing a geometric quality inspection in prefabrication factories is required to ensure all as-produced MEP elements have accurate positions and correct dimensions. However, the traditional manual inspection process is inaccurate and time-consuming. To address the problem, this study presents an automated geometric quality inspection technique to estimate the geometric properties of MEP modules using 3D laser scanning. The proposed technique firstly extracts the steel frame of the MEP module from the scanned data and registers the scanned data with the as-designed building information modeling (BIM) model of the module. Each MEP element in the module is then detected from the scanned data with the proposed shape fitting algorithm customized for different types of elements. Lastly, the checklist items for geometric quality inspection are computed based on the extracted as-built MEP elements. Experiments on two prefabricated MEP modules were conducted, which demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076826396

However, the full potential of virtual models, especially at the construction and operation phases, remains largely unrealized. With the developments in information and communication technology, a number of attempts have been made to extend the use of these models, through the development of integration approaches and technologies. An important aspect of integration not adequately addressed so far relates to that between the virtual model and physical construction such as to enable bi-directional coordination. Bi-directional coordination between virtual models and the physical construction has the potential to improve consistency maintenance, real-time progress monitoring and control of construction process/constructed facility, tracking of changes and model updates, information exchange between the design office and the real-time, documentation of as-built status, and sustainable practices. This paper presents a comprehensive and critical review of literature on the various integration approaches and technologies in AEC/FM.

Rule-based scripts that assist and guide the modeller in model authoring are needed to enhance the level of usage of BIM. The authors developed a framework for incorporation of rule-driven domain knowledge into BIM authoring tools. With the objective of customizing the modelling process using a set of rules, the approach presented in this paper combines rules of modular coordination in prefabricated building with BIM. Modular coordination, a dimensional coordination system for sizing and placing building elements within a three-dimensional (3D) reference system, is translated into rules that are incorporated into the BIM authoring tool through object-level and process-level interventions. The study explores various options of parametric modelling for integration of identified modular coordination rules. The aim of integrating modular coordination rules is to assist the user during the modelling process. The proposed approach has the potential of reducing inconsistencies and time spent in modelling and documentation allowing the designer to spend more effort on value-adding design tasks. With the help of a case study and an experiment, capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated and validated. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027100938

However, and like most innovations, the uptake of OSM has been rather slow. While relevant potential improvements and barriers are widely discussed in the literature, there is a gap in understanding how key project stakeholders (i.e. clients and manufacturers) perceive the value created by adopting OSM into their projects. This paper attempts to fill that gap by developing a value-based model, with its constituents firmly rooted in the seminal literature. The model depicts factors critical to value-creation from both product and process perspectives, allowing for causal relationships among all the inputs and outputs. A systems approach was adopted where causal relationships involving key identified stakeholders are modelled. Industry consultations have led to the identification of the levels of influence and dependency that each factor has on the value creation process. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992700382

The result is a dynamic BIM (“dyna-BIM”) capable of updating its geometry to match a 3D point cloud.

In this situation, brittle fracture can be another concern of the casting products if there are defects in the connections. A study of defect tolerance for cast steel connections is therefore very important to prevent brittle fracture from weld defects or casting defects. This paper describes defect tolerances for cast steel connections in braced frames and explores the possibility of brittle fracture from assumed defects in typical cast steel connectors.
