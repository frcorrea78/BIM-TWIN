We need better and less subjective understanding of why accidents occur and how to prevent future ones. The most effective models will go beyond assigning blame and instead help engineers to learn as much as possible about all the factors involved, including those related to social and organizational structures. This paper presents a new accident model founded on basic systems theory concepts. The use of such a model provides a theoretical foundation for the introduction of unique new types of accident analysis, hazard analysis, accident prevention strategies including new approaches to designing for safety, risk assessment techniques, and approaches to designing performance monitoring and safety metrics. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

In this paper, we examine the potential of using real-time 3D GIS for the development and implementation of GIS-based intelligent emergency response systems (GIERS) that aim at facilitating quick emergency response to terrorist attacks on multi-level structures (e.g. multi-story office buildings). We outline a system architecture and a network data model that integrates the ground transportation system with the internal conduits within multi-level structures into a navigable 3D GIS. We examine important implementation issues of GIERS, especially the need for wireless and mobile deployment. Important decision support functionalities of GIERS are also explored with particular reference to the application of network-based shortest path algorithms. Finally, we present the results of an experimental implementation of an integrated 3D network data model using a GIS database of Franklin County, Ohio (USA). Our study shows that response delay within multi-level structures can be much longer than delays incurred on the ground transportation system, and GIERS have the potential for considerably reducing these delays. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Majority of the current building maintenance systems mainly focus on capturing either information or knowledge. This research aims to develop an integrated system to capture information and knowledge of building maintenance operations when/after maintenance is carried out to understand how a building is deteriorating and to support preventive/corrective maintenance decisions. To develop the system, a number of case studies were investigated and interviews were conducted with professionals from different building maintenance departments in public organisations. This methodology helped identify the building maintenance process and the opportunities for knowledge capture and exchange. A taxonomy for building maintenance was then identified which enabled a formal approach for knowledge capture. The proposed system utilises the functions of information modelling techniques and knowledge systems to facilitate full retrieval of information and knowledge for maintenance work. The system consists of two modules; BIM module to capture relevant information and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) module to capture knowledge. The system can help maintenance teams learn from previous experience and trace the full history of a building element and all affected elements by previous maintenance operations. It is concluded that the integrated knowledge-based BIM systems can provide advanced useful functions for construction operations. On the other hand, incorporating Knowledge Management principles embedded in CBR systems with Information Management principles embedded in BIM systems is a way forward for the transformation from 'Building Information Modelling' to 'Building Knowledge Modelling'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to outdoor environments, first responders and planners have limited information regarding the indoor areas in terms of architectural and semantic information as well as how they interact with their surroundings in case of indoor disasters. Availability of such information could help decision makers interact with building information and thus make more efficient planning prior to entering the disaster site. In addition as the indoor travel times required to reach specific areas in the building could be much longer compared to outdoor, visualizing the exact location of building rooms and utilities in 3D helps in visually communicating the indoor spatial information which could eventually result in decreased routing uncertainty inside the structures and help in more informed navigation strategies. This work aims at overcoming the insufficiencies of existing indoor modelling approaches by proposing a new Indoor Emergency Spatial Model (IESM) based on IFC.

This study proposes an FMM framework based on BIM and facility management systems (FMSs), which can provide automatic scheduling of maintenance work orders (MWOs) to enhance good decision making in FMM. In this framework, data are mapped between BIM and FMSs according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) extension of maintenance tasks and MWO information in order to achieve data integration. After bi-directional data transmission between the BIM models and FMSs, work order information is visualized in BIM via API to identify components that have failed. Second, geometric and semantic information of the failure components is extracted from the BIM models to calculate the sub-optimal maintenance path in the BIM environment. Third, the MWO schedule is automatically generated using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers four factors, namely, problem type, emergency level, distance among components, and location.

This situation creates a diverse building environment with multiple variables that make fire hazards difficult to predict and monitor accurately. Therefore, developing and implementing an integrated fire disaster prevention system is necessary in order to effectively prevent fire disasters and adequately protect life and property. In Taiwan, the response to an organization of fire prevention and disaster relief as well as evacuation planning and rescue guidance continue to rely primarily on human-provided intelligence. This method makes disaster-response decision-making inherently prone to error due to the inaccuracy, incompleteness, and poor communication of this intelligence. However, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and wireless sensor networks have been widely discussed in many aspects of building disaster-prevention management as approaches to increasing the accuracy and effectiveness of disaster-response decision-making. The present study uses BIM to construct a BIM-based Intelligent Fire Prevention and Disaster Relief System. This system integrates information on personal localization, on evacuation/rescue route optimization with Bluetooth-based technology, and on a mobile guidance device to create an intelligent and two-way fire disaster prevention system framework that displays the real-time and dynamic fire information in three dimensions (3D). The results of applying the BIM-based system demonstrate that it may effectively provide 3D visualization to support the assessment and planning of fire safety, to provide early detection and alarm responses, to direct efficient evacuation, and to facilitate fire rescue and control efforts in order to increase overall building safety and disaster-response capabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027992840

The BIMFMM system is then applied in selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FMM practice. Using the BIMFMM system, maintenance staff can access and review 3D BIM models for updating related maintenance records in a digital format.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach.

These behavioral reaction patterns are influenced by some factors, such as occupant characteristics, building characteristics and fire characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate the pre-evacuation behavior of occupants under fire and explore the associations between these factors and the human behavior. To obtain the human behavioral information in real fire, a post-fire survey for a multi-storey office building fire in a major city in Mainland China was carried out with the assistance of local fire professionals. Some of the possible factors that might influence the occupants' actions at recognitions and response stage were examined.

These accumulated data have the potential to provide deep information that can help improve facility management. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology has proven potential in O&M management in some studies, making it possible to store massive data. However, the complex and non-intuitive data records, as well as inaccurate manual inputs, raise difficulties in making full use of information in current O&M activities. This paper aims to address these problems by proposing a BIM-based Data Mining (DM) approach for extracting meaningful laws and patterns, as well as detecting improper records. In this approach, the BIM database is first transformed into a data warehouse. After that, three DM methods are combined to find useful information from the BIM. Specifically, the cluster analysis can find relationships of similarity among records, the outlier detection detects manually input improper data and keeps the database fresh, and the improved pattern mining algorithm finds deeper logic links among records. Particular emphasis is put on introducing the algorithms and how they should be used by building managers. Hence, the value of BIM is increased based on rules, extracted from data of O&M phase that appear irregular and disordered. Validated by an integrated on-site practice in an airport terminal, the proposed DM methods are helpful in prediction, early warning, and decision making, leading to the improvements of resource usage and maintenance efficiency during the O&M phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033726504

This paper investigates the usage of RFID technology for indoor localization of RFID equipped assets during the operation phase of facilities. The location-related data on RFID tags attached to assets are extracted from a Building Information Model (BIM) and can provide context-aware information inside the building which can improve Facilities Management (FM) processes. First, using the current location of the assets saved on the tags attached to fixed assets, an FM personnel is able to read tags from a distance and locate them on a floor plan.

The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms.

While the challenges of BIM adoption are multifaceted, there is a recurring theme of poor data integration between BIM and existing information management systems.

The BIM-based FM system must be able to support different use cases per user role and effectively extract information required by the use cases from various heterogeneous data sources. If the FM system's user perspective becomes structurally fixed when developing the system, the lack of expandability can cause problems for maintenance and reusability. BIM perspective definition (BPD) metadata helps increase expandability and system reusability because it supports system variability, which allows adding or changing the user perspective even after the system has been developed. The information to be dealt with differs according to the user's role, which also means that the data model, data conversion rules, and expression methods change per perspective. The perspective should be able to extract only the user-requested data from the heterogeneous system's data source and format it in the style demanded by the user. In order to solve such issues, we analyzed the practice of FM and the benefits of using BIM-based FM, and we proposed a BPD that supports data extraction and conversion and created a prototype. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode.

At present, the maintenance and inspection of FSE must be performed according to the standards and methods specified by fire safety regulations, which makes it necessary to consult relevant files and drawings. However, the reading of maintenance and inspection information can be a very time-consuming endeavor as the majority of these files are in paper. To solve the aforementioned issues, building information modeling (BIM) was used in this study to construct the FSE elements so that the required information could be rapidly acquired by FSE inspectors. A cloud database for equipment inspection and maintenance was then generated by organizing the compiled information. This database was combined with the augmented reality (AR) technology to facilitate FSE inspection and maintenance using mobile devices, thus overcoming the constraints imposed by paper files on these tasks. The results of the demonstration and validation shown that the proposed BIM AR FSE system provides highly comprehensive, mobile, and effective access to FSE information.

This paper focuses on the challenges connected to the operation phase of buildings, when the adoption of BIM can make information retrieval and management easier and more efficient. More specifically, a BIM-based cyber-physical system for the automated monitoring of buildings during their regular operation is proposed and tested by means of a customised simulator. The system automatically works out key performance indicators based on the overall throughput effectiveness (OTE) metric, assessing both the overall efficiency and the efficiency of every sub-system integrated in the building. Thus, assessments of the contribution of every sub-system to the operation of the building are performed in real-time. In addition, the metric proposed can help manage multi-objective real-time control. The system is self-reconfigurable thanks to the self-similarity assumption of the computational structure that is designed as a holarchy of holonic systems. The first application reported in this paper shows that when intelligence is embedded at both lower and higher levels, it is possible to generate information that is then used to update the digital model, developed as a BIM. As a result, the digital model becomes the mirror of the physical system and stores the actual performances recorded by the building to support facility managers in making decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061984765

In the field of building operation, building performance simulation (BPS) can help in quantifying unmeasured energy flows, for instance solar gains, heat loss from infiltration, etc. Furthermore, integrating building information modeling (BIM) in building operation and maintenance can decrease operation risk and costs, as well as maintain facility management quality. However, in practice there is a lack of efficient utilization of this application by building operators. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework to estimate and visualize energy flows and the associated cost. The framework consists of 1) developing a BIM model, 2) converting the BIM model to a BPS model, 3) calibrating the model, and 4) visualizing energy and cost flows using Sankey diagrams.

Decision-making on equipment maintenance of these areas where facilities intensively locate differs from that of industrial systems or plants in two features: 1) it needs regular repetition and update because equipment replacements, facility renovations and equipment condition changes often happen during the operation phase, 2) the accumulated maintenance data in these areas are large enough to be used for decision-making. However, existing approaches to decision-making on equipment maintenance have not considered such features. To fill this gap, this research aims to propose a data-driven approach for decision-making on equipment maintenance by integrating three technologies: Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS). By implementing quantitative decision-making models and Monte-Carlo simulation, a data-driven RCM process is proposed. BIM and GIS are integrated to support the acquisition and update of data required for the proposed RCM process. Based on requirement analysis and architecture design, a prototype system is developed and verified by using a virtual campus. The results show that the proposed approach reduces labor cost and diminishes difficulties of decision-making on equipment maintenance.

However, user interaction with connected devices suffers from numerous disadvantages such as complex and cumbersome user interfaces, unreliable voice and gesture interfaces, and the requirement for prior knowledge of the environment.

This functionality is enabled by coupling an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based indoor positioning system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to retrieve contextual information of the user with respect to the built environment when the user performs the pointing action. This information is then input into a building information model (BIM)-based virtual environment wherein the appliance of interest to the user is determined. The subsequent clicking action of the user then turns the devices on or off based on its prior state via the IoT infrastructure in the building.

Currently, although many studies have focused on developing advanced technology and improving fire emergency management effectiveness, advanced technology often fails because of the inapplicability or non-use of the technology. Therefore, it is necessary to combine building users' behavior decisions with advanced technology and propose fire response modes that are adapted for such users. Based on the Building Information Modeling (BIM) platform, this paper builds a fire emergency management system (FEMS) that considers the behavior decisions of building users (behaviors such as escape, wait for rescue, and fire extinguishing). We develop a database management module and four functional modules that include fire intelligence-monitoring, fire-warning, fire-response, and fire-treatment. The system realizes the dynamic monitoring of building fires, the judgment of fire category, the locations of users, and the ability to view fire-points in a three-dimensional (3D) model. In addition, this system can also plan optimal action routes according to different building user's decisions, while the application (app) provides visual route guidance. Through a fire scene simulation experiment, we show that the moving distance of the Test Group equipped with FEMS is 30% shorter than the Control Group, and the total time spent is reduced by 48%.

BIM can be regarded as both a digital representation of a building and a store of data with which to facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information throughout the lifecycle of a structure. Buildings sustain economic losses during their lifecycle due to ordinary maintenance operations and unpredictable events. These events reduce the structural performance of a building and highlight the need for financial investment. The costs of maintenance operations are usually accurately defined, but other expenditure is not as easy to evaluate when events are uncertain. A lifecycle cost (LCC) analysis of buildings exposed to seismic risk is a critical issue in structural engineering. Expected losses, including initial and post-earthquake repair costs, are an important parameter in structural design. Herein, a simplified method based on a semi-probabilistic approach is implemented in a BIM model to evaluate the economic performance, and economic losses, of a building exposed to seismic risk. A BIM procedure is implemented in a case study to improve the feasibility of this process and to deal with the large amount of data concerning the damage to and cost analysis of the components that constitute the facility.

Findings: Data sources from both sensor data and qualitative questionnaire were analysed and a matrix of elements affecting building performance in areas such as energy use, comfort use, integration with technology was presented. In addition, a prototype sensor visualisation platform was designed to connect in-use performance data to BIM. Originality/value: This work presents initial findings from a post occupancy evaluation utilising sensor data. The work attempts to address the issues of BIM in-use scenarios for housing sector. A prototype was developed which can be fully developed and replicated to wider housing projects. The findings can better address how indoor thermal comfort parameters can be used to improve housing stock and even address elements such as machine learning for better buildings. © 2019, Kay Rogage, Adrian Clear, Zaid Alwan, Tom Lawrence and Graham Kelly.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074055473

For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named ‘WoTAS’ (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based ‘STriDE’ (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed ‘WoTAS’ system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations. Eventually, understanding the worker movements will contribute towards reducing the chances of near-miss incidents on sites which have the potential to cause serious accidents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066983744

Originally designed to engineer-out environmental hazards associated with working in a building’s confined spaces (during the construction phase of a building’s life-cycle), this second generation version is expanded upon to use archival records to proactively learn from data generated within a sensor network during the building’s operations and maintenance (O&M) phase of asset management (AM). Design/methodology/approach: An applied research methodological approach adopted used a two-phase process. In phase one, a conceptual model was created to provide a “blueprint map” to integrate BIM, sensor-based networks and data analytics (DA) into one integral system. A literature review provided the basis for the conceptual model’s further development. In phase two, the conceptual model was transposed into the prototype’s development environment as a proof of concept using primary data accrued from a large educational building.

However, there are several types of delays that significantly influence project durations, often resulting from misunderstanding and miscommunications among parties (owners, contractors, and other stakeholders). One of the more common delays is change orders that are usually attributed as one of the major reasons behind delays in construction. Making changes after a building enters the construction phase can be very expensive, conflicting, and time-consuming. Such delays may arise due to the lack of communication and coordination among the owner and the contractors regarding the change orders. In most instances, it is highly conflicting to form a mutual agreement when there is a predicted price difference to accept a change order. To minimize the impact of change orders on the design and total cost, an approach that allows communication and interaction with 3D models through advanced visualization tools (i.e., virtual and augmented reality environments) can be effective. To further identify the influence of immersive virtual environments (IVEs) on project management, a systematic approach is proposed through which stakeholders can: (1) visualize and interact with 3D models in one-to-one scaled realistic virtual environments (fully immersive); and (2) visualize the dollar amount changes as the results of change orders.

The research presents a new concept, which shows how the BIM can be exploited efficiently during maintenance. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, existing facility management (FM) processes were investigated to find out how to digitize them and identify bottlenecks. Second, BIM’s data content was explored to identify the information that could be used to streamline FM processes. Third, the potential of the active data measured in the building was evaluated. Finally, research was undertaken to find out how constantly fluctuating information can be combined with BIM objects and what kind of added value that combination could offer. The literature review was used to support the primary contribution. In addition, the research problems were described and the basics of the research were obtained by interviews. The author has interviewed 27 professionals from several stakeholders. Findings: The first finding is that the BIM can serve as a platform for building use, various services and management when it has been adequately generated during the planning and construction phases and enriched before being commissioned. The other essential finding is the theory of conditions data model (CDM), which is a technical environment that combines active data with BIM. The most important advantages of BIM in FM are as follows: • Building owner attains better user satisfaction, acquires better quality and smarter services, saves energy, ensures better indoor conditions and improves building profitability. • Service providers can develop and offer new services, speed up operations, save resources and generate more profits. • The occupant gets a better user experience, faster and higher quality services and better indoor conditions. Research limitations/implications: The CDM enables to generate for the real estate and construction (RE&C) sector a novel BIM-based ecosystem with standard rules, instead of every individual operator developing his/her own unique solution for BIM use in FM. This will have an impact on the entire RE&C sector’s operating methods and will have significant financial implications in the near future. Application of this research is limited to office buildings where indoor condition measuring is undertaken continuously and where the knowledge of the use cases of spaces is available. In addition, the proper BIM in the Industry Foundation Classes format must exist. The evaluation of the validity of big data is not discussed in this article. Visualization of data and content of user interfaces will be the topic of another article by the author. This article does not deal with intricate technical details, but crucial issues are defined. Originality/value: The article presents a unique method for BIM use in FM. The theory of CDM (how to combine active data with BIM) is completely new and a similar solution has not been presented earlier. The theory of the presented method will be the crucial key for BIM use and will lead worldwide commissioning. Currently, the theory is under test in the practical pilot project.

Nevertheless, taking decisions based on 3D visualization remains a challenge since the high density of spatial information inside the 3D model requires suitable visualization techniques to achieve the visual task. The occlusion is ubiquitous and, whilst solutions already exist such as transparency, none currently solve this issue with an automatic and suitable management of the camera. In this paper, we propose the first RESTful web application implementing a 3D viewpoint management algorithm and we demonstrate its usability in the visualization of assets based on a BIM model for visual counting in facility management.

Although BIM is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90 s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process. © 2021",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081203066

The novelty of our methodology lies in the semantic linking of video object recognition results from visual and thermal cameras with Building Information Models (BIM). The current limitations and possibilities of certain building information streams in the context of fire safety or fire incident management are addressed in this paper. Furthermore, our data management tools match higher-level semantic metadata descriptors of BIM and deep-learning based visual object recognition and classification networks. Based on these matches, estimations can be generated of camera, objects and event positions in the BIM model, transforming it from a static source of information into a rich, dynamic data provider. Previous work has already investigated the possibilities to link BIM and low-cost point sensors for fireground understanding, but these approaches did not take into account the benefits of video analysis and recent developments in semantics and feature learning research. Finally, the strengths of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art is its (semi-)automatic workflow, generic and modular setup and multi-modal strategy, which allows to automatically create situational awareness, to improve localization and to facilitate the overall fire understanding. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018966452

Benefits of using Building Information Management (BIM) tools for this purpose will not be fully realized unless the Facility Management and Operation (FM&O) activities and processes are adjusted accordingly. This paper aims to provide the theoretic basis for more focused studies on existing and desired processes in the FM&O sector and their associated information transactions. Academic literature as well as empirical studies in the subject area of building information management and workflow processes of the FM&O sector are consulted and analyzed.

Despite the proliferation of research on the use of PSTs for FM, a comprehensive review of such research is missing from the literature. This study aims to cover the knowledge void by examining the status quo and challenges of the selected PSTs with a focus on FM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviewed 204 journal papers recounting cases of using PSTs for FM. The reviewed papers were extracted from Elsevier Scopus database using the advanced search. Findings: Findings of this study revealed that PSTs and FM applications form a many-to-many mapping, i.e. one PST could facilitate many FM applications, and one application can also be supported by various PSTs. It is also found that energy modeling and management is the most referred purpose in FM to adopt PSTs, while space management, albeit important, received the least attention. Five challenges are identified, which include high investment on PSTs, data storage problem, absence of proper data exchange protocols for data interoperability, a lack of mature data processing methods for data utilization and privacy of users. Originality/value: This paper paints a full picture of PSTs adoption for FM. It pinpoints the promising explorations for tackling the key challenges to future development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078568756
