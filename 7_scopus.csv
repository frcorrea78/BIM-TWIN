Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When choosing the most effective investment project in construction, a major problem associated with the actual demand for resources is underestimated. In order to solve this problem in the most effective way, the application programs, covering virtually every phase of the specific construction product development, e.g. planning, design, cost estimation, scheduling, fabrication, construction, maintenance and facility management were developed and supplemented with the calculation of the demand for resources, comparison of alternatives and determination of the duration of all the stages of the project life.

Project Management Triangle) of projects. Developing project schedules is almost always troublesome, since it is heavily dependent on project planners' knowledge of work packages, on-the-job-experience, planning capability and oversight. Having a thorough understanding of the project geometries and their internal interacting stability relations plays a significant role in generating practical construction sequencing. On the other hand, the new concept of embedding all the project information into a 3-dimensional representation of a project (a.k.a. Building Information Model or BIM) has recently drawn attention to the construction industry. In this paper, the authors demonstrate a novel approach of retrieving enough information from the BIM of a project and then develop construction sequencing for the installation of the project elements. For this reason a computer application is developed that can automatically derive a structurally (statically) stable construction sequence, using the concept of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The term ""structurally stable sequencing"" in this article refers to the sequencing order of erection in which the structure remains statically stable locally and globally during the entire installation process. To validate the proposed methodology, the authors designed 21 different experiments and used the proposed method for generating stable construction schedules, which all were successfully accomplished. Therefore, this methodology proposes a novel approach of construction project application of the GA, as an Expert System tool. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was prompted by the industry's need to systemically estimate greenhouse gas emissions from railway construction and maintenance activities. In this paper, the emphasis is placed on plain-line railway maintenance and renewal projects. The objective of this study was to reduce the uncertainties and assumptions of previous studies based on ballasted track maintenance and renewal projects. A field-based data collection was carried out on plain-line ballasted track renewals. The results reveal that the emissions from the materials contribute more than nine times the CO2-e emissions than the machines used in the renewal projects. The results show that extending the lifespan of rail infrastructure assets through maintenance is beneficial in terms of reducing CO2-e emissions. Analysis was then carried out using the field data. Then the results were compared to two ballastless track alternatives. The results show that CO2-e emissions per metre from ballasted track were the least overall, however, the maintenance CO2-e emissions are greater than those of ballastless tracks over the infrastructure lifespan, with ballasted track maintenance emitting more CO2-e emissions at the 30 and 60year intervals and the end of life when compared to the ballastless track types. The outcome of the study can provide decision makers, construction schedulers, environmental planners and project planners with reasonably accurate GHG emission estimates that can be used to plan, forecast and reduce emissions for plain-line renewal projects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948807326

The work tasks of all these different co-builders need to be aligned to allow for the efficient delivery of the product. To allow for smooth alignment, all co-builders work together in the planning phase to rule out unwanted conflicts between work activities. Despite these efforts, many projects still accrue costs forced by on-site conflicts that were not anticipated beforehand and require costly improvisation to be resolved. The potential of 4D CAD models to avoid costly on-site improvisation by providing possibilities to anticipate conflicts better in the planning phase has been widely acknowledged. However, little empirical evidence exists that illustrate these benefits. This paper provides such evidence by providing in-depth narratives of how 4D CAD models helped to foresee conflicts on a major railway station renovation project in the Netherlands. These narratives describe in detail how practitioners on the case study successfully used 4D CAD models to coordinate their construction engineering designs, their construction schedules, and their construction operations. With these findings, the paper contributes to 4D literature by providing empirical case-based evidence for the benefits of applying 4D CAD models to plan construction work. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Three aspects of the planning process that contain clear class effects are looked at: the amount of office space, the flexibility of plans, and the appropriation of the urban environment as exchange or use value. These aspects structure the urban redevelopment but are external to the communicative planning process. The opposition to the redevelopment has in the planning discourse been articulated as ""community""-based rather than in class-sensitive terms.

Interface management (IM) has become the most important aspect of a sound project management strategy. IM affects project cost, scheduling, and quality both directly and indirectly in construction projects. Interface or changed events can be identified and tracked using IM, such that construction processes can be improved, while minimizing rework and reducing total project duration. Despite the many studies and discussions in academic and practical literature, systematic approaches and information platforms for managing interface events and problems during the construction are lacking. This study tracks and manages interface events using novel three-dimensional (3D) interface maps integrated into the building information modelling (BIM) approach. The BIM approach, which is utilized to retain interface information in a digital format, facilitates easy interface updating and transfer in the 3D CAD environment. The 3D-based interface maps provide users with an overview of interface events during a given construction project, such that users can track and manage interfaces virtually. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web Construction BIM-based IM (ConBIM-IM) system for engineers to enhance interface information sharing and efficiency tracking in construction projects. The ConBIM-IM system is applied to a case study of a building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its IM effectiveness. Case study results show that the ConBIM-IM system is effective for managing interfaces using the BIM approach in construction.
