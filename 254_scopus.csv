Most previous BIM case examples focused on buildings, and limited studies have reported on the adoption and use of BIM in infrastructure projects. Therefore, this research aims to analyze and compare the adoption and use of BIM in infrastructure projects, particularly in constructing major road projects in Australia and the People's Republic of China. The related BIM uses and associated technologies of the projects were analyzed based on a case study approach. Subsequently, a number of comparative analyses were conducted on the cultural and managerial aspects between the projects, as well as different BIM uses between buildings and infrastructure projects. The results show both case studies had quite similar uses of BIM, yet the adopted managerial strategies and issues encountered were rather different. The evolution of BIM uses from buildings to infrastructure projects is also discussed. The research presented can provide insightful references for the future adoption and use of BIM in other infrastructure projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991619094
"Aven T.","The concept of antifragility and its implications for the practice of risk analysis",2015,"Risk Analysis",39,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929573585&doi=10.1111%2frisa.12279&partnerID=40&md5=f8ffd559d516e4743eaf629c2b4fb07d","Nassim Taleb's antifragile concept has been shown considerable interest in the media and on the Internet recently. For Taleb, the antifragile concept is a blueprint for living in a black swan world (where surprising extreme events may occur), the key being to love variation and uncertainty to some degree, and thus also errors. The antonym of ""fragile"" is not robustness or resilience, but ""please mishandle"" or ""please handle carelessly,"" using an example from Taleb when referring to sending a package full of glasses by post. In this article, we perform a detailed analysis of this concept, having a special focus on how the antifragile concept relates to common ideas and principles of risk management. The article argues that Taleb's antifragile concept adds an important contribution to the current practice of risk analysis by its focus on the dynamic aspects of risk and performance, and the necessity of some variation, uncertainties, and risk to achieve improvements and high performance at later stages. © 2014 Society for Risk Analysis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929573585

For example, active faults identified during pre-feasibility studies will pose one type of hazard, whereas a management decision to limit the extent of a site investigation to save money will pose another type of hazard. A systematic assessment of the nature and the source of the various hazards may be used to differentiate the types of geotechnical risk. Examples from projects are provided and some statistics are presented, to indicate the rates of occurrence of the various types of geotechnical risks in projects. Some established approaches to managing geotechnical risks in projects are noted. © 2010 Geological Society of London.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956008424

The proposed development comprises, the extension of the existing breakwater wharf (including new breasting and mooring dolphins and associated dredging in and around the berth pocket) to accommodate 300m+LOA vessels, and a feasibility study into a fixed or floating wave attenuator for the protection of smaller recreational and commercial vessels moored in the marina. To facilitate cost effective acquisition of geotechnical and geophysical data, Crown Lands planned a stepped approach to the ground studies across the entire area, to be undertaken as a single work package. Initially, an Aquares resistivity survey was undertaken to define the geological structures at the site. An Integrated Digital Ground Model (IDGM) was then created that included available geophysical studies and historical geotechnical datasets. Crown Lands utilised this model to plan a targeted geotechnical campaign designed to mitigate latent geological risks specific to the current project, including dredge batter and pile embedment designs. The IDGM was constructed utilising Encom Discover PA 2015 (an interactive 4 dimensional GIS environment) and in the final iteration included newly acquired Aquares data, 21 historical boreholes, 15 vibracores, side scan, magnetometer and reflection datasets. The IDGM also included raw metadata such as run-lines, side scan mosaics and SEG-Y images to assist in comparing unrelated datasets against one another. The IDGM has been utilised to realise an 11% reduction in programmed piling costs and identify $3 million in previously unidentified dredge costs. The creation of an IDGM is a research project currently being undertaken by OEMG primarily to create robust ground models and to ensure all data formats are digital and compatible with GIS, BIM (Building Information Modelling) and civil design packages such as 12D and AutoCAD. This paper explores the advantages of such an approach and how the work flow and model might be improved in the future.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973517366
