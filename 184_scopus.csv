Innovation can provide a solution to the main environmental issues, but often meets resistance. While certain types of technological or organisational innovation can be satisfactorily analysed using closed system theories, in the case of seaports and in particular in the area of environmental sustainability, more advanced conceptual frameworks have to be considered. These frameworks need to be able to account for the multiple stakeholder nature of the port industry and of the network and vertical interactions that environmental sustainability calls for. This article investigates successful innovations improving environmental sustainability of seaports. The proposed framework builds in part on research concepts developed in the InnoSuTra EU FP7 project. From a methodological perspective, this article develops a method for quantifying the degree of success of innovation with respect to a set of specific objectives. Several case studies are used to test the framework against real innovation examples, such as onshore power supply, or alternative fuels. In this article, we argue that only those innovations that fit dynamically port actors’ demands and the port institutional environment stand a chance to succeed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907593004

In the last decades the need to better understand and monitor energy-related activities taking place near or within the port has become more apparent as a consequence of the growing relevance of energy trades, public environmental awareness and a bigger industry focus on energy efficiency. The uptake in the port sector of innovative technologies, such as onshore power supply, or alternative fuels, such as LNG, and the increasing development of renewable energy installations in port areas, also calls for more attention to energy matters within port management.So far, however, few port authorities have actively pursued energy management strategies. The necessity for port authorities to actively manage their energy flows stems from their efforts to plan, coordinate and facilitate the development of economic activities within the port, and as a consequence of the heavier weight that sustainability is given within the port management strategies.Through the analysis of the experiences of two European ports, Hamburg and Genoa, that have already attempted to coordinate and rationalise their energy needs, this paper will argue that for the ports of the future active energy management can offer substantial efficiency gains, can contribute to the development of new alternative revenue sources and in the end, improve the competitive position of the port. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902081980

Stricter environmental regulations are adopted by authorities to limit pollutants and GHG emissions arising from energy consumption. Increasingly, port operational strategies and energy usage patterns are under scrutiny. To ingrain sustainability and environmental protection of ports, the use of innovative technology appears as a critical conduit in achieving a transition from a carbon-intensive port industry (dependent on fossil fuels) to a low-carbon port model by harnessing renewable energy, alternative fuels (e.g. LNG, hydrogen, biofuel), smarter power distribution systems, energy consumption measurement systems. In this context, this paper conducts a systematic literature review to analyze operational strategies (e.g. peak shaving, operations optimization), technology usage (e.g. electrification of equipment, cold-ironing, energy storage systems), renewable energy, alternative fuels and energy management systems (e.g. smart grid with renewable energy) for improving the energy efficiency and environmental performance of ports and terminals. Research gaps and future research directions are identified. Analysis shows that there is a great potential for ports to achieve further energy efficiency and researchers have many impactful research opportunities. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066168868

The success of such transformation, however, greatly relies on a thorough understanding of the city's states of spatiotemporal flux. The ability to understand such fluctuations in context and in terms of interdependencies that exist among various entities across time and space is crucial, if cities are to maintain their smart growth. Here, we introduce a Smart City Digital Twin paradigm that can enable increased visibility into cities' human-infrastructure-technology interactions, in which spatiotemporal fluctuations of the city are integrated into an analytics platform at the real-time intersection of reality-virtuality. Through learning and exchange of spatiotemporal information with the city, enabled through virtualization and the connectivity offered by Internet of Things (IoT), this Digital Twin of the city becomes smarter over time, able to provide predictive insights into the city's smarter performance and growth. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046124603

To mitigate negative environmental impacts in ports, there are stricter regulations that target creative designs for minimizing pollution. Nevertheless, such policies to mitigate environmental impacts result in a cost for the relevant parties, especially the ports themselves. To analyze the impact of environmental policy on ports, a simulation technique based on system dynamics is introduced with the case of Busan port as an illustration. Results show that both the environmental policies (EPs) and the policy options (POs) create positive effects and negative effects on ports. Although EPs and POs seem to increase the negative effects on the port in the short term, they are helpful to strengthen the competitiveness of ports by the vitalization of port activities and the port cluster. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028947819

The smart grid relies on the use of network platforms where meter readings and data can be transmitted. On the other hand, concerning transportation systems the need to achieve a reduction of road congestion and traffic accidents among the increasing use of electric vehicles has consolidated the importance of ITS (intelligent transport systems). Given the magnitude of the challenges faced by both the smart grid and ITS, the aim of this work is to identify the elements comprising a convergence platform capable of supporting future services for data traffic associated to smart grid operations as well as ITS-related commercial service applications and road traffic safety messaging. A seaport terminal scenario is used to present a convergence network platform incorporating WSN (wireless sensor network) theory. The results of the simulation of the proposed network confirms the suitability of WSN to be used in the transmission of data traffic associated to meter readings which is required for effective energy consumption and management policies in industrial environments comprising equipment with high energy demands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941879863

Dr.-Ing. Herbert Schmidt zur Vollendung seines 80. Lebensjahres gewidmet. The construction industry is well known for falling behind in the implementation of information technologies. Many digital technologies are, however, applicable throughout the entire value chain, and the use of industrialized construction is rapidly increasing with a view to improving planning, design, construction, assembly, operation and maintenance. Different technologies have changed the engineering and construction processes drastically, and the rate at which change is taking place is generally agreed to be accelerating. This article presents four international case studies that exemplify the utilization of information modeling in bridge design projects. Information modeling is more than just a new technology – it is a new way of working which has the power to totally transform the design and construction industry.
