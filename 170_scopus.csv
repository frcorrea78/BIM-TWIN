There is a pressing need to automate this process. Previous research has achieved the automatic generation of surface primitives combined with rule-based classification to create labeled cuboids and cylinders from point clouds. Although these methods work well in synthetic data sets or idealized cases, they encounter huge challenges when dealing with real-world bridge point clouds, which are often unevenly distributed and suffer from occlusions. In addition, real bridge geometries are complicated. In this article, we propose a novel top-down method to tackle these challenges for detecting slab, pier, pier cap, and girder components in reinforced concrete bridges. This method uses a slicing algorithm to separate the deck assembly from pier assemblies. It then detects and segments pier caps using their surface normal, and girders using oriented bounding boxes and density histograms. Finally, our method merges oversegments into individually labeled point clusters. The results of 10 real-world bridge point cloud experiments indicate that our method achieves very high detection performance. This is the first method of its kind to achieve robust detection performance for the four component types in reinforced concrete bridges and to directly produce labeled point clusters. Our work provides a solid foundation for future work in generating rich Industry Foundation Classes models from the labeled point clusters. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061350222

Cyclic inspections by hand according to DIN 1076 are the basis for planning maintenance and repair measures for our engineering structures. The calculation of condition ratings is performed based on detected deficiencies. The documentation of the inspection is done primarily within the program system SIB-BW. The system offers a comparably uniform rating standard and enables a limited retrospective and prospective view for maintenance planning. New developments like BIM or continuous, sensor-based monitoring, which is established in other branches, are not yet conceptually integrated. In light of the digital transformation the question arises how the well established manual and the digital assessment as well as BIM generated data can be unified within one continuous process chain and which benefits can by created by doing so. Therefore, the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) has initiated the “smartBridge Hamburg” project which prototypically tests the concept of the digital twin using the Koehlbrandbruecke in Hamburg. The digital twin is used to conceptually unify the BI-model as well as analogue and electronic assessment data and to provide aggregated data in a form that meets the needs of different user groups. This paper presents premises and basic considerations prior to project initiation. © 2020, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086148171

Digitalisation is a strategy to increase the sector’s productivity, competitiveness, and efficiency. However, digitalisation also impacts environmental goals, such as those concerning more eco-friendly solutions, energy efficiency, products recycling, and sustainability certifications. These strategies rely on data, understood as digital, interoperable, incremental and traceable. Data related concepts, such as digital data templates (DDT) and digital building logbooks (DBL), contribute to “good data”. Despite some research focused on each one, little importance has yet been given to their combination. Relevant relationships and overlaps exist, as they partially share the exact same data through the built environment life cycle. This research aims to provide improved understanding on the role of these concepts and their contribution to a more circular industry. The review develops conceptualisations where DDT and DBL are complementary and framed within an incremental digital twin construction (DTC). Misconceptions or confrontations between these three solutions can therefore stand down, for the benefit of a data-driven priority. To increase understanding and reduce misconceptions, our study developed the “Digital data-driven concept” (D3c). This concept contribution is the ability to structure, store, and trace data, opening way to streamlined digital transformation impacting circular built environment concerns. © 2021 by the authors.
