In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing.

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology.

This requires the acquisition of data from various sources followed by the transformation of these data into an appropriate format. The integration and representation of heterogeneous data in a GIS are very important for use cases involving both BIM and GIS data, such as in the management of municipal facilities. We propose a BIM/GIS-based information Extract, Transform, and Load (BG-ETL) architecture that separates geometrical information from that related to the relevant properties. The property required for each use-case perspective is extracted and transformed from information for the BIM with FM to GIS using the ETL concept. In consideration of the viewpoint of geometry, the surface model for several representations in the GIS, we designed BG-ETL, developed a prototype, and verified the results through interviews. The results show that BG-ETL considering BIM/GIS integration issue has benefits such as reusability and extensibility. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. Elsevier B.V.

Information from GIS can facilitate BIM applications such as site selection and onsite material layout, while BIM models could help generate detailed models in GIS and achieve better utility management. The mapping between the key schemas in the BIM domain and the GIS domain is the most critical step towards interoperability between the two domains. In this study, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) were chosen as the key schemas due to their wide applications in the BIM domain and the GIS domain, respectively. We used an instance-based method to generate the mapping rules between IFC and CityGML based on the inspection of entities representing the same component in the same model. It ensures accurate mapping between the two schemas. The transformation of coordinate systems and geometry are two major issues addressed in the instance-based method. Considering the difference in schema structure and information richness between the two schemas, a reference ontology called Semantic City Model was developed and an instance-based method was adopted. The Semantic City Model captures all the relevant information from BIM models and GIS models during the mapping process. Since CityGML is defined in five levels of detail (LoD), the harmonization among LoDs in CityGML was also developed in order to complete the mapping. The test results show that the developed framework can achieve automatic data mapping between IFC and CityGML in different LoDs. Furthermore, the developed Semantic City Model is extensible and can be the basis for other schema mappings between the BIM domain and the GIS domain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, “BIM leads and GIS supports” “GIS leads and BIM supports” and “BIM and GIS are equally involved” are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved.

Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply opening, sharing, and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access (http://openmsi.nersc.gov). The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e.g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e.g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide >2000-fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0.3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets.

JSON is a key-value style lightweight data exchange format that has higher parsing efficiency than XML and due to the inadequacies of XML, JSON has been widely used in Web applications, specifically in Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) Web services.

Therefore, the study explains the implementation of the IFC standard as a JSON schema to guide the creation of JSON documents.

While in building information modeling (BIM) conventional building information (such as geometry, material, or cost) can precisely be described using current modeling standards, information about SHM systems, referred to as “monitoring-related information” cannot be fully described on a well-defined, formal basis. In this paper, a BIM-based approach towards describing monitoring-related information is proposed, using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open BIM standard facilitating the interoperability of BIM models, as a formal basis. First, possibilities and constraints of describing monitoring-related information with the IFC schema are discussed. Then, information necessary to describe SHM systems is integrated into a semantic model serving as a technology-independent metamodel. Next, the IFC schema is extended to enable BIM-based descriptions of SHM systems in compliance with IFC modeling capabilities, which is referred to as “IFC Monitor” schema. The IFC Monitor schema is verified with test software used in the official IFC certification program. For validation, a prototype SHM system is formally described using the IFC Monitor schema. The validation aims at checking if the IFC Monitor schema is capable of precisely describing monitoring-related information. As will be shown in this paper, the description of the prototype SHM system meets the requirements of a well-defined IFC model as specified in the official IFC certification program.

The most common procedure for defining a product data model is to first describe the business and/or engineering process in a formal process model, then to create a product data model based on the process model. However, there is a logical gap between process modeling and product modeling methods in the current ISO 10303 standard product modeling process. We propose a new formal approach, called Process to Product Modeling (PPM) in which process and product modeling can be logically linked. This paper focuses on the semantics and syntax for the Requirements Collection and Modeling (RCM) of PPM. The new RCM method aims to model heterogeneous business processes and their information flows. The major difference between the proposed method and traditional requirements collection methods is that it provides a theoretical linkage to integrate process models and a set of specific information items used in them. This theoretical linkage enables modelers to capture the contents, scope, granularity, and semantics of information used in activities, which are depicted in process models. A PPM method, called Georgia Tech Process to Product Modeling (GTPPM), has been developed and was deployed for the North American Precast Concrete Software Consortium; examples from this effort are presented.

To handle the considerable amounts of data generated in the process of scanning building structures, we present intelligent compression approaches combined with the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) as an efficient serialization and an alternative to clear text encoded ISO 10303 part 21 files. Based on prototypical implementations we show results of various serialization options and their impacts on storage efficiency. In this proposal the deepened semantic relationships have been favoured over compression ratios. Nevertheless, with various near-lossless layers of compression and binary serialization applied, a compression ratio of up to 67.7% is obtained for a building model with integrated point clouds, compared to the raw source data. The binary serialization is able to handle hundreds of millions of points, out of which specific spatial and semantic subsets can rapidly be extracted due to the containerized hierarchical storage model and association to building elements.

Particularly in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction product domains, neutral product models have been developed to support integration across segments of the product lifecycle and thus support a range of applications. Because of this, only subsets of the neutral data structures are utilized in any one exchange. Subsets are also called conformance classes (ISO-STEP, CIS/2) or views (IFC), and include subtle conceptual and intentional differences. In current practice, the subset definition method ranges from just selecting entity data types, to defining a sub schema (data model), or to describing the purpose of the subset in natural language. This diversity in defining a subset comes from the complexity of reference relationships and subtyping capabilities of current product data models defined in the EXPRESS product modeling language. This article presents a formal method for defining a schema subset using set theory. It introduces the concept of a base set. A base set works as a building block of a subset with identified rules.

Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain. The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the process while still providing accurate results. Several cases of BIM geo-referencing are presented and discussed. Furthermore, our experiments show that centimetre accurary can be reached in the alignment process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076711893

In this article, we propose algorithms for safest routes and balanced routes in buildings, where an extreme event with many epicenters is occurring. In a balanced route, a trade-off between route length and hazard proximity is made. The algorithms are based on a novel approach that integrates a multiattribute decision-making technique, Dijkstra's classical algorithm and the introduced hazard proximity numbers, hazard propagation coefficient and proximity index for a route. © 2016 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960192936

However, a point of contention in this integration has yet to be resolved. In view of the shortcomings of the network transmission and browser rendering of current integrated BIM-GIS schemes, accordingly the 3D Tiles data format using Web Graphics Library (WebGL) as the standard for rendering 3D models has been widely considered in recent years. This study provides an implementation plan for data integration and information interaction between BIM and GIS. It aims to improve the traditional model simplification processing solution, analyze the current insufficient network transmission and browser rendering ability of the BIM and GIS integration scheme, and transform the BIM model from the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) into the 3D Tiles data format. In this study, IFC standard files are first exported as the data source, and the mapping relationship between BIM files and 3D Tiles files is analyzed. The integral IFC model is then reorganized to form JSON files associated with semantic attributes and building component models with geometric information. The proposed relationship mapping allows the attribute contained in the IFC models to be delivered to 3D tiles. Meanwhile, the coordinate transformation, data mapping, spatial index, and Level of Details (LOD) hierarchical division are completed during conversion to ensure fast and efficient rendering interaction of BIM data and geographical features in the 3D WebGIS framework. The experiment results indicated that users can quickly load the BIM model on the Web site, which may be viewed as a feasible solution for the large-scale data integration of GIS and BIM on the Web site. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075102316

However, the current assessment schemes are (a) static in nature, and as such don't reflect the dynamic and real-time nature of urban artefacts, (b) are not grounded in semantics (e.g. BIM and GIS), and (c) are at best used to assist in regulatory compliance, for instance in energy design, to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Information and communication technologies provide a new value proposition capitalizing on the Internet of Things (IoT) and semantics to provide real-time insights and inform decision making. Consequently, there is a real need in the field for data models that could facilitate data exchange and handle data heterogeneity. In this study, a semantic data model is considered to support near real-time urban sustainability assessment and enhance the semantics of sensor network data. Based on an extensive review of urban sustainability assessment frameworks and ontology development methodologies, the Urban District Sustainability Assessment (UDSA) ontology has been developed and validated using real data from the site of “The Works”, a newly refurbished neighbourhood in Ebbw Vale, Wales. This novel approach reconciles several domain-specific ontologies within one high-level ontology that can support the creation of real-time urban sustainability assessment software. In addition, this information model is aligned with 29 authoritative urban sustainability assessment frameworks, thus providing a useful resource not only in urban sustainability assessment, but also in the wider smart cities context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074789238

While interesting proposals exist for querying Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models, their functionality is often incomplete and their semantics not precisely defined. With the introduction of the ifcOWL ontology as an equivalent to the IFC schema in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), an option to represent such models in RDF (Resource Description Framework, a general information modeling method) is provided, and such models can be queried using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). The size of data sets in complex building projects, however, renders the use of clear-text encoded RDF infeasible in many cases. A SPARQL implementation, compatible with ifcOWL, is proposed, directly atop a standardized binary serialization format for IFC building models. This novel format is the binary equivalent of traditional IFC serialization formats but with more compact storage and less overhead than the graph serialization in RDF. The format is based on ISO 10303-26 and relies on an open standard for organizing large amounts of data: Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5). Due to hierarchical partitioning and fixed-length records, only small subsets of the data are read to answer queries, improving efficiency. A prototypical implementation of the query engine is provided in the Python programming language. In several realistic use cases, the proposed system performs equivalent to or better than the state of the art in SPARQL querying on building models. For large datasets, the proposed storage format results in files that are 2–3 times smaller than the current, most concise, RDF databases while offering a platform-neutral, containerized exchange file. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051390191

Consequently, they require large storage spaces and are not conducive for interchange purposes. Geometric optimization of MEP models can play a significant role in facilitating model exchange and handover by increasing storage, transmission and display efficiency. To date, the body of knowledge on such geometric optimization, unfortunately, is still very narrow. This paper presents and tests a solution for the optimization of storage, transmission, and display of MEP models. Storage optimization was achieved through a mapping-based model description method and a novel Quadric-Error-Metric (QEM) mesh simplification algorithm, reducing required storage while maintaining the contour of components. For transmission optimization, a normal vector compression algorithm and a fixed-dictionary specific compression algorithm were proposed to achieve efficient compression of data thus, fulfilling the need for cross-platform interchange. Display optimization was obtained through a normal vector regeneration algorithm for clustering triangle meshes to improve 3D display effects. The evaluation of the solution, performed for each individual component separately as well as for an entire solution, proved successful. Volume of storage data was reduced by 40% to 50% through mesh simplification. Data transmission volume was reduced by more than 80% for components with complicated geometry without affecting the topology of the components. Finally, the display process was capable of decreasing the number of triangles and delivering very good quality of displayed models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071976947
