Conventional methods of manufacturing automation do not lend themselves to construction of large structures with internal features. This may explain the slow rate of growth in construction automation. Contour crafting (CC) is a recent layered fabrication technology that has a great potential in automated construction of whole structures as well as subcomponents. Using this process, a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, imbedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing and air-conditioning. Our research also addresses the application of CC in building habitats on other planets. CC will most probably be one of the very few feasible approaches for building structures on other planets, such as Moon and Mars, which are being targeted for human colonization before the end of the new century. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The potential to improve on current construction methods is significant. One of such methods being explored currently, both in academia and in construction practice, is the additive manufacturing of concrete (AMoC).

Different variants in this family of manufacturing methods are being developed and improved continuously. Fundamental scientific understanding of the relations between design, material, process, and product is being explored. The collective body of work in that area is still very limited. After sketching the potential of AMoC for construction, this paper introduces the variants of AMoC under development around the globe and goes on to describe one of these in detail, the 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) facility of the Eindhoven University of Technology.

The technology has been adopted in the manufacturing industry for decades and has recently been introduced in the construction industry to print houses and villas. The technology can bring significant benefits to the construction industry in terms of increased customization, reduced construction time, reduced manpower, and construction cost. A few isolated products and projects have been preliminarily tested using the 3-D printing technology. However, it should be noted that such tests and developments on the use of 3-D printing in the construction industry are very fragmented at the time of the study. It is therefore necessary for the building and construction industry to understand the technology, its historical applications and challenges for better utilization in the future. A systematic review shows that 3-D printing technology, after years of evolution, can be used to print large-scale architectural models and buildings. However, the potential of the technology is limited by the lack of large-scale implementation, the development of building information modeling, the requirements of mass customization, and the life cycle cost of the printed projects. It is therefore expected that future studies should be conducted on these areas to consolidate the stability and expand the applicability of 3-D printing in the construction industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach aims to tackle the generation of direction-parallel tool-paths for the interior filling of simple connected areas, which comprises three main steps: (1) determining the inclination of reference lines; (2) generating and grouping tool-path segments into individual sub-paths; and (3) linking sub-paths based on specific requirements. These three modules interact to affect the efficiency and precision of AM significantly. In order to find an optimal inclination, we first analyze the impacts on the fabrication efficiency and manufacturing accuracy with different inclinations. A comparatively accurate building time model is developed subsequently to obtain the optimal tool-path inclination, but without compromising the machining precision, based on the analysis of a geometrical accuracy model. The proposed approach employs different inclinations in distinct layers according to specific manufacturing scenarios and technological requirements. After determining the reference lines, the tool-path segments are selected and grouped based on some characteristics (e.g., the number of intersections between reference lines and boundaries) to make up individual sub-paths, which are then connected to a zigzag-shaped path with short line segment connections. In the module for sub-path linking, some strategies are introduced to decrease the number of useless tool-paths, i.e., uncut paths, which could jeopardize the manufacturing quality by frequently turning the print head on and off. In addition, parametric curves are used to link the final sub-paths to avoid deceleration/acceleration processes in the end/starting parts of the sub-paths. The proposed approach has been used in practice to generate tool-paths for a wide range of models and the results verify its effectiveness and obvious advantages. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915816684

Most of the reports suggest the adoption of innovations including off-site manufacture and emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) to overcome the challenges facing the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of off-site manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of off-site manufacture, the benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture have been widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction. However, studies about impacts of BIM on off-site manufacture are scarce with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates the implications of BIM systems on off-site manufacture and traditional construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of BIM for off-site manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support off-site manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of off-site manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture and traditional construction is undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on off-site manufacture, off-site manufacture and BIM on traditional construction. The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on off-site manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient and one of the best ways to improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the construction industry for generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031763679

In an intelligent factory, introducing edge computing is conducive to expanding the computing resources, the network bandwidth, and the storage capacity of the cloud platform to the IoT edge, as well as realizing the resource scheduling and data uplink and downlink processing during the manufacturing and production processes. Moreover, the emotion recognition and interaction of the Affective Interaction Intelligence Robot (iRobot), with the IoT cloud platform as the infrastructure and AI technology as the core competitiveness, can better solve the psychological problems of the user. Accordingly, this has become a hot research topic in the field of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we describe an intelligent robot factory (iRobot-Factory), adopt a highly interconnected and deeply integrated intelligent production line, and introduce the overall structure, composition, characteristics, and advantages of such a factory in details from the two aspects of cognitive manufacturing and edge computing. Then, we describe the implementation of the volume production of iRobot using iRobot-Factory and look at the system performance experimental results and analysis of the iRobot-Factory and a traditional factory. The experimental results show that our scheme significantly improved both the chip assembly and the production efficiency, while the number of system instructions also decreased significantly.

However, few previous studies on geopolymer investigated the steel-to-concrete bonding behavior and fire-resistance at very high temperatures (>800 °C), hence cannot reveal the damage of a severe fire accident. This paper presents the results of an extensive experimental study carried out to investigate the effect of elevated temperature on the thermal-physical behaviors and mechanical properties of fly ash-based geopolymer paste. After being exposed up to 1200 °C according to the RATB fire curve, the damage stages of geopolymer paste (GPC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) were investigated through the unconfined compressive strength test, push-out test, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Based on the results and existing literature, there was a less mass loss and a better compressive strength for GPC paste after the treatment, which led to a better bonding behavior of GPC compared with OPC paste. In addition, a positive linear relationship between the bond strength and the compressive strength was found for both GPC and OPC. Furthermore, the stable properties of phases change and porous micro-structure in GPC identified by SEM and XRD methods were important for a better bond behavior at elevated temperatures. Thus, the GPC offers a feasible alternative to OPC in practical fire-resistant building applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084037048

Although industrialized building systems can potentially simplify the production process, there is usually a high level of complexity in ETO production systems, such as uncertainty in client demands, short lead-time, overlapping between project stages, and resources that are shared among different projects. In this context, logistics management plays a key role in terms of achieving project goals related to cost, time and safety. This research work proposes the combined use of principles from the Lean Production Philosophy and Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a mechanism to cope with the complexity involved in those types of projects. Although these can be regarded as two separate approaches for improving the performance of production systems in the construction industry, there are evidences that there is much synergy between them. This paper reports the development of a logistics planning and control model for site assembly of ETO prefabricated building systems using BIM 4D modeling. The main theoretical contribution of this research work is the understanding of the synergies between Lean principles and BIM functionalities that are applicable to site logistics management, providing an example of how this body of knowledge can be expanded.

Based on a case study, it shows how to bridge any gaps between those information systems used within the design, prefabrication, and on-site construction processes. The information requirements of the aforementioned three key processes are analysed regarding an industrialized construction project, and any gaps identified between their three sets of requirements. A theoretical model for information mapping is proposed using these requirements. The solution is then verified through a case study, performed within the operational environment of a construction company. This case study represents one approach for applying the proposed information mapping model, and possible benefits for the industry. The information analysis highlights significant distinctions among particular views on the information required for supporting the tasks during the three above-mentioned processes. The main difference lies in the levels of data granularity important for particular tasks. Building Information Modelling based construction (BIM-based construction) proved itself to be an adequate context for bridging the information gaps. BIM-based construction can accommodate the proposed model for information mapping across the processes. Within this context it is possible to separate the identities of physical building elements from those of designed building elements, which is required when mapping. This study shows that it is feasible to automate the proposed information mapping in the form of a computer algorithm. It explains the value and necessity of building information model (BIM) usage, in order to provide the context for information mapping. The integration of design, manufacturing, and construction processes, and a transparency of information about material resources across these processes, would bring significant benefits for all stakeholders within the supply-chain. In the case study, the architecture and a prototype of the software system were developed in order to implement the proposed idea. Specifically, the case study showed that the proposed information mapping improved the project's progress monitoring, detailed planning, and management of material flows, across the construction supply-chain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The thermal and mechanical properties of geopolymers at high temperature have attracted great attention from many researchers. However, there are few systematic works concerning these two issues. Therefore, this work reviewed the thermal and mechanical behaviors of geopolymers at high temperature. Firstly, the thermal properties of geopolymers in terms of mass loss, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity after high temperature were explained. Secondly, the mechanical properties of residual compressive strength and stress-strain relationship of fly ash geopolymers and metakaolin geopolymers after high temperature were analyzed. Finally, the microstructure and mineralogical characteristics of geopolymers upon heating were interpreted according to the changes of microstructures and compositions. The results show that the thermal properties of geopolymers are superior to cement concrete. The geopolymers possess few mass loss and a low expansion ratio and thermal conductivity at high temperature. The thermal and mechanical properties of the geopolymers are usually closely related to the raw materials and the constituents of the geopolymers. Preparation and testing conditions can affect the mechanical properties of the geopolymers. The stress-strain curves of geopolymer are changed by the composition of geopolymers and the high temperature. The silicon-type fillers not only improve the thermal expansion of the geopolymers but also enhance mechanical properties of the geopolymers. But, they do not contribute to reducing the thermal conductivity. the different raw materials, aluminosilicate precursor and reinforcement materials, result in different geopolymer damage during the heating. However, phase transitions can occur during the process of heating regardless of the raw materials. The additional performance enhancements can be achieved by optimizing the paste formulation, adjusting the inner structure, changing the alkali type, and incorporating reinforcements. © 2020 Rui He et al.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084041353

Previous studies have attempted to optimize the layout plan of residential buildings for minimizing the total energy usage, mainly focusing on low-rise houses of a regular shape and having a limited number of design variables. However, layout design for high-rise residential buildings involves the complicated interaction among a large number of design variables (e.g., different types of flats with varying configurations) under practical design constraints. The number of possible solutions may increase exponentially which calls for new optimization strategies. Therefore, this study aims to develop an energy performance-based optimization approach to identify the most energy-efficient layout plan design for high-rise residential buildings. A simulation-based optimization method applying the evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to systematically explore the best layout design for maximizing the building energy efficiency. In an illustrative example, the proposed optimization approach is applied to generate the layout plan for a 40-storey public housing in Hong Kong. The results indicate that GA attempts to maximize the use of natural-occurring energy sources (e.g., wind-driven natural ventilation and sunlight) for minimizing 30–40% of the total energy consumption associated with air-conditioning and lighting.

Furthermore, the industry is slowly transitioning towards sophisticated Building Information Modelling (BIM), which necessitates the integration of domain specific knowledge into the BIM authoring tools. The approach presented in this paper elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a designer to create building models within the rules of Modular Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance the design process and allow designers to automate some complex modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise. The development of rule-based BIM objects exploits the parametric modelling capabilities of BIM authoring tools in addition to visual programming tool to automate the modelling process. The research first explains development of rule based BIM objects which is extended to streamline the overall design process. The presented approach discusses the customization of BIM authoring tool for modelling a residential facility in MC using axial planning of structural elements. In the prototype system, the designer is guided by specific rules and constraints while providing sufficient options to develop variegated configuration. The integration of design rules of MC standards with BIM application will be influential to increase radical use of BIM for built environment especially in the prefabrication industry. © 2015 The Authors.

Previous studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the optimization of individual structural elements and the topological arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material cost are both reduced by 18–24% after performing optimization. The proposed approach can be extended to optimize other types of buildings (such as steel framework) with a similar problem nature, thereby improving the cost efficiency and environmental sustainability of the built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068671653

This holds true for concrete materials that have versatility in processing, including normal mixing and casting in the construction industry; spraying or so-called shotcrete application in soil stabilization for mining or construction excavations, extrusion in pre-casting factories for structural elements intended for the construction industry; and spinning manufacturing processes for concrete pipes. Recent innovation in 3D printing for construction demands yet another adaption of the mix design and manufacturing process. This paper presents an overview of required adaptions in terms of mix ingredients and mixing process and equipment to produce the appropriate rheology in the fresh state, rate of viscosity change for dimensional stability, sufficient adhesion/cohesion for interlayer bond, and appropriate, specified hardened and fresh rheology. Attention is given to fresh rheology and the chemical additives to prevent ingredient segregation during mixing and processing, despite a range in fluidity required by the various processes from highly workable for pumping, to dough-like consistency for extrusion and 3D printing. © Copyright 2016 by Pro-AM 2016 Organizers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021431268

As the construction of reinforced concrete (RC) structures consumed tremendous amounts of steel reinforcement and concrete, RC structural design optimization for minimal environmental impact has attracted increasing attentions from academics and industry in recent years. Nowadays, new information technologies and computing techniques were increasingly utilized for the sustainable design and optimization of RC structures to maximize energy efficiency, but it still lacks a critical review to summarize the common research themes and highlight the future needs in this field. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to critically review the previous research related to the computational design optimization of RC structures for the minimum environmental impact, with the aim of highlighting the present status and future trends for the advancement of building design optimization. First, the general introduction and background for importance of multidisciplinary detailed design optimization of RC structures are described. Thereafter, a critical review of available research objectives, structural components, optimization strategies, and the use of different computational tools in RC structural design optimization to integrate sustainability in constructional design stage, is provided in this paper. Furthermore, different research trends are analyzed and critically discussed in detail. Potential research directions to better quantify and evaluate the implementation of detailed RC structural design optimization are presented. This paper can assist structural design practitioners in academia and industry to introduce new horizons of sustainable construction by considering multiple aspects of detailed RC structural design and combining several computational tools with optimization strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082103990

Although the use of industrialized building systems can potentially simplify the production process on-site, the complexity of the overall delivery system tends to be high, especially in engineered-to-order (ETO) environments, due to factors such as uncertainty related to goals and methods, conflicts between different trades on-site, and interdependence between supply chain members. This paper explores the concept of modularity, which has proven to be useful in different industries as a way of dealing with complex systems. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how modularity can reduce the complexity of ETO industrialized building systems, in companies that adopt a mass customization strategy. This investigation is based on two descriptive case studies on the development of modular structural steel systems for buildings that have adopted innovative beam-to-column connections. The main contribution of this research is demonstrating the need to adopt an integrated product and process-oriented conceptualization of modularity in industrialized building systems. Moreover, the comparison between the two case studies pointed out that the management of tolerances plays a key role in achieving high productivity and short lead times in structural steel building systems. This investigation also illustrates how the adoption of a limited set of modular components can be used to decouple design decisions, and standardize different types of processes. © 2017 by the authors.

The efficiency of on-site construction practice is contingent upon the effectiveness of the specific model used to communicate information. Architects use CAD models to develop a project design, while construction engineers use management tools and spreadsheets to assist in project estimating control and integration. Today, the efficiency of this process is dependent upon the ability of project participants to interpret these discipline-specific models in order to form mental pictures of a proposed design and manually perform material take-offs and estimating. This process contributes to misinterpretation and subsequent estimating errors. Advanced computer tools can be used to prepare smart designs which integrate these models and coordinate the crossdisciplinary tools used for design and cost estimating. The research described in this paper is intended to support the industrialized (manufactured) construction process of residential buildings, coordinating cross-disciplinary knowledge through the utilization of building information modelling (BIM)-based 3D-paremateric modelling.

Building information modeling technology (BIM) can rely on parameter model to realize the sharing and transmission of building life cycle information, which opens up a new avenue for the study of building carbon emissions. Therefore, based on the wide review of previous literature, this study firstly divided the life cycle of industrialized buildings, then analyzed the carbon emissions within each stage, and built the parametric prototype system of life-cycle carbon emissions calculation based on BIM technology.
