This paper explores some of the publicly available international guidelines and introduces the BIM Framework, a research and delivery foundation for industry stakeholders. This is a 'scene-setting' paper identifying many conceptual parts (fields, stages, steps and lenses), providing examples of their application and listing some of the Framework's deliverables.

Despite its potential benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive systematic literature review and case study research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model.

Manufacturing principles derived from the car industry have been successfully used to produce attractive, customized and affordable homes. But there are limits to which such techniques can be applied to manage the assembly of wide varieties of component parts needed to produce complex customized products. Managers must trade off the need to achieve economies of scale in the production of standardized factory parts with economies of scope in various stages of assembly in order to provide flexibility to satisfy consumer choices. The housing industries can benefit by learning more about the use of advanced manufacturing techniques developed in car production. At the same time, automobile makers may learn more about the management of customization from the way in which housing firms organize sales, design and final assembly. The paper suggests that wider ranges of choice can be delivered through managing the whole production system, balancing the use of standard components with flexibility in assembly, rather than by solely attempting to optimize control in discrete parts of the system.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002908379

It calls for tools and approaches that could be easily embedded into everyday practices and able to combine complex methodologies with high usability requirements. In this perspective, the proposed research work is focused on the design and development of a practical solution, called Sophos-MS, able to integrate augmented reality contents and intelligent tutoring systems with cutting-edge fruition technologies for operators’ support in complex man-machine interactions. After establishing a reference methodological framework for the smart operator concept within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the proposed solution is presented, along with its functional and non-function requirements. Such requirements are fulfilled through a structured design strategy whose main outcomes include a multi-layered modular solution, Sophos-MS, that relies on Augmented Reality contents and on an intelligent personal digital assistant with vocal interaction capabilities. The proposed approach has been deployed and its training potentials have been investigated with field experiments. The experimental campaign results have been firstly checked to ensure their statistical relevance and then analytically assessed in order to show that the proposed solution has a real impact on operators’ learning curves and can make the difference between who uses it and who does not. © 2017",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029476237

This paper summarizes the findings of research aimed at investigating the statistical properties of construction duration data. Seventy-one samples of durations of construction activities are analyzed by: (1) Plotting the sample’s coefficient of skewness and kurtosis on a β1-β2 plane; and (2) constructing histograms for each sample and comparing them with the shapes of known probability density functions.

A mixed research method was employed combining literature review, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Three focus groups with 28 experts and an online questionnaire were conducted. Principal component and correlation analyses were conducted to group the identified factors and find hidden correlations. The main identified challenges were grouped into four categories and ranked in order of importance: contractor-side economic factors, client-side economic factors, technical and work-culture factors, and weak business case factors. No strong correlation was found among factors. This study will help stakeholders to understand the main industry-specific factors limiting the adoption of robotics and automated systems in the construction industry.

Even considering the specific context of pre-fabrication and modularization, it was just in recent years, with increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) processes, that the challenge, albeit in a virtual environment, begins to be really addressed. With the advent of the Digitization phenomena in Construction, and the advances in Machine Learning techniques to cope with uncertainties of different natures in modelling real processes, it seems that the use of computational tools to simulate off-site production should be reconsidered. In this article, it is adopted an approach in viewing BIM as in a development stage to become an implementation of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for Construction. Towards this end, it is identified the lack of representation of the entire dynamics of production processes inside BIM models. The proposition of using Petri Nets with stochastic transitions to represent and simulate those processes are presented, altogether with the use of real RFID data, to adjust the model parameters, collected from a case study with a Brazilian company that prefabricate wood-framing houses. The probability distributions are derived based on the Mixture of Gaussians algorithm, and considers parameters of the design of wall panels – so it could be used to extrapolated performance for new designs. Following the presented approach, it is expected that, with more data, the simulation process could be a good feedback to architects in evaluating the impact of its design options in production. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.
