However, many of their bridges are aging, and in the United States alone a very significant part of the about 600,000 existing bridges is considered to be deficient and must be replaced, repaired or upgraded in the short term. The funds available for the maintenance of existing highway bridges are extremely limited when compared with the huge investment necessary, and must, therefore, be spent wisely. In this paper, a model based on lifetime functions for predicting the evolution in time of the reliability of deteriorating bridges under maintenance is presented. This model uses the probability of satisfactory system performance during a specified time interval as a measure of reliability and treats each bridge structure as a system composed of several components. In this manner, it is possible to predict the structural performance of deteriorating structures in a probabilistic framework. In addition, the optimum maintenance strategy is identified using as objective the minimization of the present value of the life-cycle maintenance cost. An existing bridge is analyzed using lifetime functions and its optimum maintenance strategy is found. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-28444480647

Therefore, in the lifetime management of structures and infrastructures, the resistance to sudden local damage has to be considered together with the effect of progressive deterioration. The aim of this paper is to present a framework for computation of time-dependent performance indicators of civil structures and infrastructures, with emphasis on bridges, including reliability, vulnerability, robustness and redundancy. A brief theoretical background and selected structural performance indicators regarding vulnerability, redundancy and robustness are presented. The approach is based on probabilistic performance assessment supported by finite element analysis and applied to an existing bridge. Time-variation of vulnerability, redundancy and robustness associated with various damage scenarios under uncertainty and the effects of several loading conditions on performance are investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960197170

Several in-use bridges lack an appropriate regular maintenance solution, leading to extra cost during the operation stage. This paper proposes a new generation of the bridge maintenance system by using a digital twin model concept for more reliable decision-making. A detailed solution is proposed in this work to enhance the bridge maintenance process using a parallel solution: a maintenance information management system based on a 3D information model in conjunction with a digital inspection system using image processing. Three-dimensional digital models are required to utilise information from the entire lifecycle of a project, including design and construction, operation, and maintenance, by continuously exchanging and updating data from each stakeholder. For the maintenance of prestressed concrete bridges, the twin models are defined and their uses are presented. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066812168

It is necessary to develop a new generation of maintenance information management systems for more reliable decision making in bridge maintenance. Enhancing current work processes requires a BIM-based 3D digital model that can use information from the whole lifecycle of a project (design, construction, operation, and maintenance) through continuous exchanges and updates from each stakeholder. This study describes the development of a data scheme for maintenance of cable-stayed bridges. We implemented the proposed system for a cable-stayed bridge and discussed its effectiveness.

Along with the rise of new facilities, the demand in term of maintenance for the existing bridges is indispensable. Recently, the terminology of ""preventive maintenance"" is not unfamiliar with the engineer, literally is the use of a bridge maintenance system (BMS) based on a BIM-oriented model. In this paper, the process of generating a BMS based on BIM model is introduced in detail. Data management for this BMS is separated into two modules: site inspection system and information management system. The noteworthy aspect of this model lays on the closed and automatic process of ""capture image, generate the technical damage report, and upload/feedback to the BMS"" in real-time. A pilot BMS system for a cable-supported bridge is presented which showed a good performance and potential to further development of preventive maintenance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046087573
