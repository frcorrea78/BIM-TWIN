While recently developed methods in this domain focus on mere local surface reconstructions which enable e.g. efficient visualization, our approach aims for a volumetric, parametric building model that additionally incorporates contextual information such as global wall connectivity. In contrast to pure surface reconstructions, our representation thereby allows more comprehensive use: first, it enables efficient high-level editing operations in terms of e.g. wall removal or room reshaping which always result in a topologically consistent representation. Second, it enables easy taking of measurements like e.g. determining wall thickness or room areas. These properties render our reconstruction method especially beneficial to architects or engineers for planning renovation or retrofitting. Following the idea of previous approaches, the reconstruction task is cast as a labeling problem which is solved by an energy minimization. This global optimization approach allows for the reconstruction of wall elements shared between rooms while simultaneously maintaining plausible connectivity between all wall elements. An automatic prior segmentation of the point clouds into rooms and outside area filters large-scale outliers and yields priors for the definition of labeling costs for the energy minimization. The reconstructed model is further enriched by detected doors and windows. We demonstrate the applicability and reconstruction power of our new approach on a variety of complex real-world datasets requiring little or no parameter adjustment. © 2015 The Authors.

Information from GIS can facilitate BIM applications such as site selection and onsite material layout, while BIM models could help generate detailed models in GIS and achieve better utility management. The mapping between the key schemas in the BIM domain and the GIS domain is the most critical step towards interoperability between the two domains. In this study, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) were chosen as the key schemas due to their wide applications in the BIM domain and the GIS domain, respectively. We used an instance-based method to generate the mapping rules between IFC and CityGML based on the inspection of entities representing the same component in the same model. It ensures accurate mapping between the two schemas. The transformation of coordinate systems and geometry are two major issues addressed in the instance-based method. Considering the difference in schema structure and information richness between the two schemas, a reference ontology called Semantic City Model was developed and an instance-based method was adopted. The Semantic City Model captures all the relevant information from BIM models and GIS models during the mapping process. Since CityGML is defined in five levels of detail (LoD), the harmonization among LoDs in CityGML was also developed in order to complete the mapping. The test results show that the developed framework can achieve automatic data mapping between IFC and CityGML in different LoDs. Furthermore, the developed Semantic City Model is extensible and can be the basis for other schema mappings between the BIM domain and the GIS domain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We first partition the space in order to align the reconstructed models with permanent structures. The horizontal structures are located through analysis of the vertical point distribution, while vertical wall structures are detected through feature preserving multi-scale line fitting, followed by clustering in a Hough transform space. The final surface is extracted through a graph-cut formulation that trades faithfulness to measurement data for geometric complexity.

On the other hand, photorealistic aerial maps would be a useful navigational guide for large indoor environments, but it is impossible to directly acquire photographs covering a large indoor environment from aerial viewpoints. This paper presents a 3D reconstruction and visualization system for automatically producing clean and well-regularized texture-mapped 3D models for large indoor scenes, from ground-level photographs and 3D laser points. The key component is a new algorithm called “inverse constructive solid geometry (CSG)” for reconstructing a scene with a CSG representation consisting of volumetric primitives, which imposes powerful regularization constraints. We also propose several novel techniques to adjust the 3D model to make it suitable for rendering the 3D maps from aerial viewpoints. The visualization system enables users to easily browse a large-scale indoor environment from a bird’s-eye view, locate specific room interiors, fly into a place of interest, view immersive ground-level panorama views, and zoom out again, all with seamless 3D transitions.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a method to identify automatically structural steel members from a terrestrial laser scan point cloud and to generate that geometry in a BIM compatible format. The proper shape and dimensions of the cross-section are established by employing kernel density estimation. A method associated with measured metrics is introduced to determine the best match of various cross-sections, from a prepopulated library.

Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system, called SeeBridge, has been proposed. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM) was compiled to specify the technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process, and a Model View Definition (MVD) was prepared to specify the data exchange schema to serve the IDM. The MVD was bound to the IFC4 Add2 data schema standard. The IDM and MVD support research and development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data that structure bridge engineers' knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented, and the future use of the IDM is discussed.

It allows for the creation of flexible geometric models using parameters for dimensions and makes it possible to define numeric relationships between these parameters by means of mathematical formulas and define geometric-topological constraints between geometric entities. The result is a flexible geometric model that can be steered through the manipulation of its primary parameters. In contrast to explicit geometric models with fixed dimensions, a parametric model can capture the design intent and represent domain knowledge. The use of parametric modeling techniques is particularly beneficial for designing bridges. This is because the geometric design of bridges is mainly determined by external constraints resulting from the size and the layout of both the overlying and the undercrossing carriageway. This reduces the effort required for reworking when changes are made, while simultaneously providing a high degree of reusability for the model in other, similar projects, resulting in significantly increased efficiency in the bridge design process. Because of the strong fragmentation of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the data exchange between the different participants in a construction project is of crucial importance. The use of neutral, open data formats has proved to be the most suitable approach to realize this data exchange. However, currently existing neutral data formats do not allow for an exchange of parametric geometry. To overcome these technical limitations, this paper introduces an extension to the IFC-Bridge format, thus providing a means of interchanging parametric bridge models. This article describes in detail the necessary entities introduced to define parameters and capture dimensional and geometric constraints. The suitability of the developed extensions is proved by presenting the successful transfer of parametric bridge models between two parametric design systems as well as from a design system to a structural analysis system. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886449217

There is a pressing need to automate this process. Previous research has achieved the automatic generation of surface primitives combined with rule-based classification to create labeled cuboids and cylinders from point clouds. Although these methods work well in synthetic data sets or idealized cases, they encounter huge challenges when dealing with real-world bridge point clouds, which are often unevenly distributed and suffer from occlusions. In addition, real bridge geometries are complicated. In this article, we propose a novel top-down method to tackle these challenges for detecting slab, pier, pier cap, and girder components in reinforced concrete bridges. This method uses a slicing algorithm to separate the deck assembly from pier assemblies. It then detects and segments pier caps using their surface normal, and girders using oriented bounding boxes and density histograms. Finally, our method merges oversegments into individually labeled point clusters. The results of 10 real-world bridge point cloud experiments indicate that our method achieves very high detection performance. This is the first method of its kind to achieve robust detection performance for the four component types in reinforced concrete bridges and to directly produce labeled point clusters. Our work provides a solid foundation for future work in generating rich Industry Foundation Classes models from the labeled point clusters. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061350222

In order to exploit BIM methods to their full potential, a fundamental grasp of their key principles and applications is essential. Accordingly, this book combines discussions of theoretical foundations with reports from the industry on currently applied best practices. The book's content is divided into six parts: Part I discusses the technological basics of BIM and addresses computational methods for the geometric and semantic modeling of buildings, as well as methods for process modeling. Next, Part II covers the important aspect of the interoperability of BIM software products and describes in detail the standardized data format Industry Foundation Classes. It presents the different classification systems, discusses the data format CityGML for describing 3D city models and COBie for handing over data to clients, and also provides an overview of BIM programming tools and interfaces. Part III is dedicated to the philosophy, organization and technical implementation of BIM-based collaboration, and discusses the impact on legal issues including construction contracts. In turn, Part IV covers a wide range of BIM use cases in the different lifecycle phases of a built facility, including the use of BIM for design coordination, structural analysis, energy analysis, code compliance checking, quantity take-off, prefabrication, progress monitoring and operation. In Part V, a number of design and construction companies report on the current state of BIM adoption in connection with actual BIM projects, and discuss the approach pursued for the shift toward BIM, including the hurdles taken. Lastly, Part VI summarizes the book's content and provides an outlook on future developments.

This paper presents a TLS data-processing pipeline aimed at producing semantic 3D models of furnished office and home interiors.

RFID tags attached to furniture are sensed at the same time as laser scanning is conducted. The collected IDs are used to retrieve discriminatory geometric information about those objects from the building's FM database; this information is used to support their recognition and modeling in the point cloud data.
