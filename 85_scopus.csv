Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin.

The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors.

Cloud-based services based on georeferenced metric 3D imagery are already extensively used for infrastructure management in outdoor environments. The goal of our research is to enable such services for indoor applications as well. For this purpose, we designed a portable mobile mapping research platform with a strong focus on acquiring accurate 3D imagery. Our system consists of a multi-head panorama camera in combination with two multi-profile LiDAR scanners and a MEMS-based industrial grade IMU for LiDAR-based online and offline SLAM. Our modular implementation based on the Robot Operating System enables rapid adaptations of the sensor configuration and the acquisition software. The developed workflow provides for completely GNSS-independent data acquisition and camera pose estimation using LiDAR-based SLAM. Furthermore, we apply a novel image-based georeferencing approach for further improving camera poses. First performance evaluations show an improvement from LiDAR-based SLAM to image-based georeferencing by an order of magnitude: from 10-13 cm to 1.3-1.8 cm in absolute 3D point accuracy and from 8-12 cm to sub-centimeter in relative 3D point accuracy. © Authors 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048394719

This imagery is typically acquired using multi-view stereo mobile mapping systems capturing dense sequences of street level imagery. Ideally, image depth information is derived using dense image matching. This delivers a very dense depth representation and ensures the spatial and temporal coherence of radiometric and depth data. This results in a high-definition WYSIWYG (""what you see is what you get"") urban model, which is intuitive to interpret and easy to interact with, and which provides powerful augmentation and 3D measuring capabilities. Furthermore, we present a scalable cloud-based framework for generating 3D image spaces of entire cities or states and a client architecture for their web-based exploitation. The model and the framework strongly support the smart city notion of efficiently connecting the urban environment and its processes with experts and citizens alike. In the paper we particularly investigate quality aspects of the urban model, namely the obtainable georeferencing accuracy and the quality of the depth map extraction. We show that our image-based georeferencing approach is capable of improving the original direct georeferencing accuracy by an order of magnitude and that the presented new multi-image matching approach is capable of providing high accuracies along with a significantly improved completeness of the depth maps. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952802527

The lack of automated and efficient data exchange approach and protocol could potentially cause designers and other users to abandon VR after the first few design cycles. In this paper, we introduce a BIM-VR real-time data exchange system. The system is based on an innovative Cloud-based BIM metadata interpretation and communication method. With the function of allowing users to update BIM model changes in VR headsets automatically and simultaneously, the system achieves high user stickiness and reduces the complexity of workflow.

The industry's view on this new approach of accessing information from BIM models also should be investigated and its feedback should be considered for future phases of this avenue of research. This paper explores not only how BIM can be beneficial to facility management practitioners but also how its integration with MAR and making the data accessible through handheld mobile devices can enhance current facility management practices. An online survey was conducted to assess professional facility managers' characteristics, technology use and working environment, as well as the current status of BIM application in their practices. An online video scenario also has been used to illustrate to facility managers how a BIM-MAR integrated environment can provide them with mobile access to their required information. Facility managers' feedback on usability, applicability, and challenges of such environment has been investigated through a followup survey.

Some forms are then often recurrent, apparently different, but associated to common matrices, which could be therefore parameterized.

Since we focus on image-based mobile mapping, we extended the structure-from-motion pipeline COLMAP with georeferencing capabilities by integrating exterior orientation parameters from direct sensor orientation or SLAM as well as ground control points into bundle adjustment. Furthermore, we exploit constraints for relative orientation parameters among all cameras in bundle adjustment, which leads to a significant robustness and accuracy increase especially by incorporating highly redundant multi-view image sequences. We evaluated our integrated georeferencing approach on two data sets, one captured outdoors by a vehicle-based multi-stereo mobile mapping system and the other captured indoors by a portable panoramic mobile mapping system. We obtained mean RMSE values for check point residuals between image-based georeferencing and tachymetry of 2 cm in an indoor area, and 3 cm in an urban environment where the measurement distances are a multiple compared to indoors. Moreover, in comparison to a solely image-based procedure, our integrated georeferencing approach showed a consistent accuracy increase by a factor of 2-3 at our outdoor test site. Due to pre-calibrated relative orientation parameters, images of all camera heads were oriented correctly in our challenging indoor environment. By performing self-calibration of relative orientation parameters among respective cameras of our vehicle-based mobile mapping system, remaining inaccuracies from suboptimal test field calibration were successfully compensated. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.
