Recently, a key element of this integrated geospatial information to emerge is detailed geometrical and semantic information about buildings. In parallel, Building Information Models (BIMs) of today have the capacity for storing and representing such detailed geometrical and semantic information. In this context, the research aimed to investigate the applicability of BIMs in geospatial environment by focusing specifically on these two domains; site selection and fire response management. In the first phase of the research two use case scenarios were developed in order to understand the processes in these domains in a more detailed manner and to establish the scope of a possible software development for transferring information from BIMs into the geospatial environment. In the following phase of the research two data models were developed - a Schema-Level Model View and a geospatial data model. The Schema-Level Model View was used in simplifying the information acquired from the BIM, while the geospatial data model acted as the template for creating physical files and databases in the geospatial environment. Following this, three software components to transfer building information into the geospatial environment were designed, developed, and validated. The first component served for acquiring the building information from the BIM, while the latter two served for transforming the information into the geospatial environment. The overall research demonstrated that it is possible to transfer (high level of geometric and semantic) information acquired from BIMs into the geospatial environment. The results also demonstrated that BIMs provide a sufficient level and amount of (geometric and semantic) information (about the building) for the seamless automation of data management tasks in the site selection and fire response management processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the usual tool for geometry transformation from IFC (BIM) to shapefile (GIS), i.e., the Data Interoperability extension for ArcGIS (DIA), tends to result in geometric errors and cause geometric information loss. This study proposes an Open-Source Approach (OSA), in which the geometric information in IFC is retrieved through the spatial structure of IFC, i.e., IFC-Tree, and converted into shapefile by developing an automatic multipatch generation algorithm (AMG). A test on bridge model shows that OSA is more efficient than DIA and is comparable to Feature Manipulation Engine (FME), and the transformed model is easier to manage and can be used in more applications. OSA can link BIM and GIS in a more stable and efficient manner by enhancing the data transformation from BIM to GIS.

Several studies have used the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) model to generate indoor network models. These models are subject to the input data types, and the attributes of interior building objects are usually incomplete; hence, the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) can benefit indoor-outdoor integrated applications. To achieve data interoperability, an open BIM standard called Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is maintained by buildingSMART. In this study, we propose a multi-purpose geometric network model (MGNM) based on BIM and explore the strategy of indoor and outdoor network connections. To achieve the goals, the IFC-to-MGNM conversion includes the following: (1) extraction of building information from IFC, (2) isolation of the MGNM information from the aforementioned building information, and (3) build up the topological relationships of MGNM into GIS Geodatabase. In addition, an entrance-to-street strategy is proposed to connect indoor networks, entrances, and outdoor networks for detailed route planning. The experimental results indicate that the MGNM could be generated from BIM automatically and applied to connect indoor and outdoor features for the multi-purpose application. Two use-case scenarios were developed to validate the proposed methods. Compared to actual distance, the relative error was improved by 5.1% and 65.5% in the horizontal and vertical routes, respectively, over the conventional indoor network model from 2D ground plan. In addition, the computational time taken by the proposed coarse-to-fine route planning method was 25% that of the traditional single-scale route planning method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the construction industry has been using point cloud data for a variety of purposes including 3D model reconstruction, geometry quality inspection, construction progress tracking, etc. Although a number of studies have been reported on applying point cloud data for the construction industry in the recent decades, there has not been any systematic review that summaries these applications and points out the research gaps and future research directions. This paper, therefore, aims to provide a thorough review on the applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry and to provide recommendations on future research directions in this area. A total of 197 research papers were collected in this study through a two-fold literature search, which were published within a fifteen-year period from 2004 to 2018. Based on the collected papers, applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry are reviewed according to three categories including (1) 3D model reconstruction, (2) geometry quality inspection, and (3) other applications. Following the literature review, this paper discusses on the acquisition and processing of point cloud data, particularly focusing on how to properly perform data acquisition and processing to fulfill the needs of the intended construction applications. Specifically, the determination of required point cloud data quality and the determination of data acquisition parameters are discussed with regard to data acquisition, and the extraction and utilization of semantic information and the platforms for data visualization and processing are discussed with regard to data processing. Based on the review of applications and the following discussions, research gaps and future research directions are recommended including (1) application-oriented data acquisition, (2) semantic enrichment for as-is BIM, (3) geometry quality inspection in fabrication phase, and (4) real-time visualization and processing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061601993

The particularity of the platform is that data can be accessed either by a semantic view or through a 3D interface. The SIGA3D project describes a set of processes that aims, for all the stakeholders of urban projects, to manage pieces of information through all the lifecycle of construction projects. To solve the heterogeneity problem between BIM and GIS, we developed a semantic extension to the BIM called UIM (Urban Information Modeling).

Moreover, their combination can establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, “BIM leads and GIS supports” “GIS leads and BIM supports” and “BIM and GIS are equally involved” are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve its systematic integration and application to the urban built environment.

LOD3 and LOD4 models, which contain architectural details such as balconies, windows and rooms, rarely exist because, unlike coarser LODs, their construction requires several datasets that must be acquired with different technologies, and often extensive manual work is needed. In this article we investigate an alternative to obtaining CityGML LOD3 models: the automatic conversion from already existing architectural models (stored in the IFC format). Existing conversion algorithms mostly focus on the semantic mappings and convert all the geometries, which yields CityGML models having poor usability in practice (spatial analysis, for instance, is not possible). We present a conversion algorithm that accurately applies the correct semantics from IFC models and that constructs valid CityGML LOD3 buildings by performing a series of geometric operations in 3D.

The main challenge in BIM and GIS integrated application comes from the fundamental data conversion, especially for the geometric information. BIM and GIS use di?erent modeling paradigms to represent objects. The BIM dataset takes, for example, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) that use solid models, such as boundary representation(B-Rep), swept solid, constructive solid geometry(CSG), and clipping, while the GIS data set mainly uses surface model sor B-Rep. The fundamental data conversion between BIM and GIS is the foundation of BIM and GIS integrated application. However, the efficiency of data conversion has been greatly impaired by the human intervention needed, especially for the conversion of the clipping geometry. The goal of this study is to automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shape file format. A process-level approach was developed with an algorithm for instantiating unbounded half spaces using B-Rep. Four IFC models were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that (1) the proposed approach can successfully automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shapefile format; and (2) increasing boundary size has no effect on the file size of unbounded half spaces, but slightly increases the producing time of half spaces and processing time of building components.

Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain. The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the process while still providing accurate results. Several cases of BIM geo-referencing are presented and discussed.

Map projections are commonly used to georeference the designed geometries before constructing them on the surface of the Earth. The scale in a map projection varies depending on the position in the map plane, which leads to scale distortions between the designed geometries and the geometries staked out for construction. These distortions are exaggerated for large longitudinal projects such as the construction of roads and railroads because the construction site spans a larger area. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasing in popularity as a way to manage information within a construction project. Its use is more widespread in the building industry, but it is currently being adopted by the infrastructure industry as well. The open BIM standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) has recently developed support for alignment geometries, and full support for disciplines such as road and railroad construction is underway. This study tests whether the current IFC standard can facilitate georeferencing with sufficiently low distortion for the construction of infrastructure. This is done by performing georeferencing using three different methods, all using the information provided in the IFC schema, and by calculating the scale distortions caused by the different methods. It is concluded that the geographic capabilities of the IFC schema could be improved by adding a separate scale factor for the horizontal plane and support for object-specific map projections. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055585349

Considering high risk and cost of offshore operations, module lift planning among multiple offshore platforms with transport vessels is required to be carefully conducted. The lift planning usually contains two main parts: module layout on vessels planning and vessel transport schedules arrangement. In contrast to the current experience-driven module lift planning, this paper formulates the lift planning optimization problem and develops a web system integrating building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information system (GIS) to efficiently disassemble topsides for multiple offshore platforms. BIM provides detailed information required for planning module layout on vessels and GIS contains the management and analysis of geospatial information for the vessel transport schedule arrangement. As for module layout optimization, three heuristic algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FA) are implemented and compared to obtain the module layout with the minimum total lift time. While for vessel transport schedule, graph search technique is integrated with a developed schedule clash detection function to obtain the transport schedule with the minimum sailing time. The proposed optimization algorithms and techniques are integrated into a developed BIM/GIS-based web system. An example of three offshore platforms with eighteen modules in total is used to illustrate the developed system. Results show that the developed system can significantly improve the efficiency of lift planning in multiple topsides disassembly. The developed BIM/GIS-based web system is also effective and practical in the resource allocation and task assignment among multiple locations, such as construction sites, buildings, and even cities. © 2018",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050131498

For GIS, BIM is a promising source of three-dimensional (3D) building information that can be used in the study of smart city, green building, big data, etc. The underlying data transformation from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile enables GIS to use the rich building information. However, this transformation is difficult due to the different modelling methods used by IFC and shapefile. IFC generally represents 3D objects using boundary representation (Brep), swept solid, constructive solid geometry (CSG), clipping and mapped representation, while shapefile only uses Brep. In addition, the use of different coordinate systems also contributes to the geometry transformation issue. Among all the solid modelling methods used by IFC, Brep and swept solid are the most often used two methods. Compared with Brep, the transformation of swept solid is more challenging as each type of profile for swept solid defined in IFC has to be properly interpreted and converted. This paper develops algorithms to interpret the commonly used profiles of swept solid for the transformation of IFC into shapefile. A bridge model is used to validate the proposed method, and a Web GIS-based bridge management system is developed to demonstrate a possible usage of the transformed shapefile model. © 2020 The Author(s).

Due to various backgrounds in the acquired images, conventional vision-based techniques rely heavily on manual processing to extract relevant structures of interest for subsequent analysis in many applications, such as distress detection. This practice is laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address the challenge, this study proposes a new method that automatically matches a georeferenced real-life photo with a building information model-rendered synthetic image to allow the extraction of relevant structure of interest. Field experiments were conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed method. The average accuracy of this method is 79.21% and the processing speed is 140 s per image.

However, the intrinsic differences between BIM and GIS have led to enormous problems in BIM‐to‐GIS data conversion, and the use of City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) has further escalated this issue. This study aims to facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS by proposing using the shapefile format, and a creative approach for converting Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile was developed by integrating a computer graphics technique. Thirteen building models were used to validate the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the IFC‐to‐shapefile conversion is easier and more flexible to realize than the IFC‐to‐CityGML conversion, and (2) the computer graphics technique can improve the efficiency and reliability of BIM‐to‐GIS data conversion. This study can facilitate the use of BIM information in GIS and benefit studies working on digital twins and smart cities where building models are to be processed and integrated in GIS, or any other studies that need to manipulate IFC geometry in depth. © 2021 by the authors.

In most cases, engineering design is based on Cartesian coordinate systems. However, as facilities are placed in a geospatial context, discrepancies result from the transformation from the Earth's curved surface to the orthogonal coordinate system and engineers and developers must take this into account. With this in mind, the dimensions of a model may not correspond to those in the real world, but are rather distorted according to the used coordinate reference system (CRS). We provide a thorough background of geospatial and BIM models to define and illustrate the problem at hand. We introduce three possibilities for spatial interpretation of the geometries and their locations within a BIM model. Option A sees the model as a true-to-scale representation of the asset, option B interprets the model distorted in the same manner as the underlying CRS, and option C is a combination of the former. We explore each option with a case study and visual clues. We show that, while Option A is the most prevalent interpretation in the literature, experts from the infrastructure field prefer Option C, whose underlying rationale is explained in detail. We find that introducing infrastructural concepts to BIM methods requires the systematic resolution of georeferencing. We propose a workflow for the correct handling of any BIM geometries for construction projects. Additionally, we provide a decision diagram to help project stakeholders determine when the distortions of a CRS can be knowingly neglected. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089729356
