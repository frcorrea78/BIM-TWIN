Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525940

In the current literature, there is still a lack of efforts to systematically review the state of the art of this new industrial revolution wave. The aim of this study is to address this gap by investigating the academic progresses in Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse the academic articles within the Industry 4.0 topic that were published online until the end of June 2016. In this paper, the obtained results from both the general data analysis of included papers (e.g. relevant journals, their subject areas and categories, conferences, keywords) and the specific data analysis corresponding to four research sub-questions are illustrated and discussed. These results not only summarise the current research activities (e.g. main research directions, applied standards, employed software and hardware), but also indicate existing deficiencies and potential research directions through proposing a research agenda.

Front-end technologies consider four dimensions: Smart Manufacturing, Smart Products, Smart Supply Chain and Smart Working, while base technologies consider four elements: internet of things, cloud services, big data and analytics. We performed a survey in 92 manufacturing companies to study the implementation of these technologies. Our findings show that Industry 4.0 is related to a systemic adoption of the front-end technologies, in which Smart Manufacturing plays a central role. Our results also show that the implementation of the base technologies is challenging companies, since big data and analytics are still low implemented in the sample studied.

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2017 The Authors.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019987476

As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios. A comprehensive taxonomy of Industry 4.0 can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050613632

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062655898

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research. © 2020 The Authors",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082386834

Building information modeling (BIM) has been developed as a potential technology for FMM in buildings. This study proposes an FMM framework based on BIM and facility management systems (FMSs), which can provide automatic scheduling of maintenance work orders (MWOs) to enhance good decision making in FMM. In this framework, data are mapped between BIM and FMSs according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) extension of maintenance tasks and MWO information in order to achieve data integration. After bi-directional data transmission between the BIM models and FMSs, work order information is visualized in BIM via API to identify components that have failed. Second, geometric and semantic information of the failure components is extracted from the BIM models to calculate the sub-optimal maintenance path in the BIM environment. Third, the MWO schedule is automatically generated using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers four factors, namely, problem type, emergency level, distance among components, and location.

The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped.

In this environment, inappropriate work-space planning in a construction site causes work-space problems, which results in a loss of productivity, safety hazards, and issues of poor quality. Therefore, the work space should be considered one of the most important resources and constraints to manage at a construction site. However, current construction planning techniques have proven to be insufficient for work-space planning because they do not account for the spatial feature of each activity. To establish a formalized work-space planning process, therefore, this paper categorizes work space by its function and movability and suggests a framework for a work-space planning process that contains five phases, including 4D building information model (BIM) generation, work-space requirement identification, work-space occupation representation, work-space problem identification, and work-space problem resolution. The proposed framework in this paper can improve the accuracy of work-space status representation and work-space problem identification by introducing the work-space occupation concept and the integrated work-space planning process that considers characteristics of activity, work space, and construction plan. In addition, this paper aims to ameliorate the work-space planning process through path analysis and a formalized work-space problem resolution process. To validate the proposed approach, a case project was tested. The result shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework on improving the work-space planning process.

These technologies are posed to fundamentally change assembly lines around the world. Assembly systems transformed by I4.0 technology integration are referred to here as Assembly 4.0 (A4.0). While most I4.0 new technologies are known, and their integration into shop floors is ongoing or imminent, there is a gap between this knowledge and understanding the form and the impact of their full implementation in assembly systems. The path from the new technological abilities to improved productivity and profitability has not been well understood and has some missing parts. This paper strives to close a significant part of this gap by creating a road map to understand and explore the impact of typical I4.0 new technologies on A4.0 systems. In particular, the paper explores three impact levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. On the strategic level, we explore aspects related to the design of the product, process, and the assembly system. Additionally, the paper elaborates on likely changes in assembly design aspects, due to the flexibility and capabilities that these new technologies will bring. Strategic design also deals with planning and realizing the potential of interactions between sub-assembly lines, kitting lines, and the main assembly lines. On the tactical level, we explore the impact of policies and methodologies in planning assembly lines. Finally, on the operational level, we explore how these new capabilities may affect part routing and scheduling including cases of disruptions and machine failures.

This paper proposes and demonstrates a robust technique that uses the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema to automatically update an as-designed BIM based on site observations for inspected building elements. It receives as input an inspected object's actual type and inspection details including the detected defects/changes, responsible actors, as-built/as-is type, captured images, and time and the date of the inspection. The algorithm automatically analyzes the IFC data model to retrieve the element's semantics and identifies discrepancies between the as-built/as-is and as-designed object conditions. Based on the results of the discrepancy analysis, the IFC data model is populated with new semantics, resulting in the update of object types, properties, and three-dimensional (3D) shape representations.

The mechanical engineering sector have to know how new technologies can be successfully integrated for the benefit of the customer. Production processes and supply chains will become more efficient, with advances in productivity and huge savings in material and energy. Digitalization goes hand in hand with the growing importance of platforms for data exchange, customer contact and services.

While extant research identifies the diffusion of digital innovations in firms as a non-linear process influenced by embedded contextual elements stemming from several complex social systems, it does not address the relationship between these social systems. A longitudinal embedded case of the process followed by one incumbent firm as it adopts building information modelling (BIM) is presented. Data covers a 15-year period and charts the adoption process at multiple levels: user, firm and institution. The case supports existing research by showing that BIM adoption in the firm is successful through a combination of actions involving 1) investment and leadership support, 2) standards and policies and 3) training and skills development. Drawing on Gidden’s Structuration Theory, it contributes to this research by finding that the adoption of BIM is facilitated by a mutually constitutive relationship between user, firm and institution. Firms play a central role in enabling this relationship, by both attending to and enabling endogenous user-led change while seeking to influence exogenous institutional change. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element.

To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema.

The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for FM in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages of the building lifecycle is intended to bridge the gap between operations and digital data, but lacks the functionality of assessing and forecasting the state of the built environment in real-time. To accommodate this, BIM data needs to be constantly updated with the current state of the built environment. However, generation of as-is BIM data for a digital representation of a building is a labor intensive process. While some software applications offer a degree of automation for the generation of as-is BIM data, they can be impractical to use for routinely updating digital FM documentation. Current approaches for capturing the built environment using remote sensing and photometry-based methods allow for the creation of 3D point clouds that can be used as basis data for a Digital Twin (DT), along with existing BIM and FM documentation. 3D point clouds themselves do not contain any semantics or specific information about the building components they represent physically, but using machine learning methods they can be enhanced with semantics that would allow for reconstruction of as-is BIM and basis DT data. This paper presents current research and development progress of a service-oriented platform for generation of semantically rich 3D point cloud representations of indoor environments. A specific focus is placed on the reconstruction and visualization of the captured state of the built environment for increasing FM stakeholder engagement and facilitating collaboration. The preliminary results of a prototypical web-based application demonstrate the feasibility of such a platform for FM using a service-oriented paradigm. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054529484

In recent years, several researchers have used illustrative case studies to demonstrate how adopting BIM for specific uses can improve project performance. However, generalizable findings that may be extended across the industry remain somewhat elusive. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study to examine the impact of BIM use adoption and BIM Execution Planning (BEP) on project performance across a range of project delivery methods. The core research questions guiding the study were (1) does increased BIM use adoption improve project performance, as measured by cost, schedule, and quality metrics? and (2) what role does BEP have in the successful implementation of BIM on a project? By leveraging data from over 200 projects, these questions were answered via a multiple regression analysis. The results showed a significant positive relationship between BIM use adoption and the speed of delivery, perceived facility quality, and group cohesion within the project team, when controlling for project complexity. There was no evidence to suggest that the level of participation in BEP by members of the project team moderated those relationships. Instead, BEP participation was a significant predictor of BIM use adoption. Projects implementing BEP with either a designer-contractor team or the full project team were associated with increased BIM use adoption compared with projects that did not implement BEP. Despite these key findings, this study revealed a need for a new approach for capturing process data across projects to enable more-detailed future analysis. Prior research, including the data set used in this study, was designed to test macrolevel relationships, and omits many of the details about the specific processes or implementation aspects that drive day-to-day actions. Transitioning to collect a more focused data set, aimed at the microlevel of BIM and BEP implementation, and potentially lean construction practices, would enable a better understanding of the value these tools bring to projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062077478

The total cost of these activities within the capital facilities industries in the United States was conservatively estimated at $15.8 billion in 2002, with two-thirds of that cost occurring during the facilities’ operations and maintenance phase. This is confirmed by the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) Maintenance Survey in 2009, which states that the loss of information generates an added cost of 12.4% of total annual mean O&M costs.

Design/methodology/approach: The Building Handover Information Model (BHIM) framework proposed herein is contextualized given the Construction Operation Information Exchange (COBie) and the level of development schema. The process uses Autodesk Revit as the primary BIM-authoring tool and Dynamo as an add-in for extending Revit’s parametric functionality, BHIM validation, information retrieval and documentation in generating operation and maintenance (O&M) deliverables in the end-user requested format. Findings: Given the criticality of semantics for model elements in the BHIM and for appropriate interoperability in BIM collaboration, each discipline should establish model development and exchange protocols that define the elements, geometrical and non-geometrical information requirements and acceptable software applications early in the design phase. In this case study, five information categories (location, specifications, warranty, maintenance instructions and Construction Specifications Institute MasterFormat division) were identified as critical for model elements in the BHIM for handover purposes. Originality/value: Design- and construction-purposed BIM is a standard platform in collaborative architecture, engineering and construction practice, and the models are available for many recently constructed facilities.

In a nutshell, BIM could be understood as a set of new processes to design, plan, and construct buildings, based on 3D virtual objects that represent different building components, and its mutual relationships. Nowadays, most applications of BIM processes are focused on the concept, design, and planning phases of the building lifecycle. Part of the reason behind that fact is that construction processes are still largely dependent of human labor, and dynamic connection between BIM models and real progression on-site during construction phase are almost non-existent. In exploiting the digitization promoted by the introduction of BIM, it should be important to consider the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies to Construction. This papers presents a framework in which Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Construction are based on virtual models of construction processes, implemented via Petri Nets, and connected to both BIM models, and to hardware (sensors and actuators) working in on-site production / assembly. Then, the proposed framework is 'relaxed' and extended to be applied in a scenario where CPS are just a bi-directional link between virtual models and its real counterparts on-site, without hardware to be controlled, but with observations based on data acquired via sensing. Such proposition aims to concentrate efforts and promote the importance of process models in construction, and to provide simulation and optimization to the current processes based on data from real-time progression monitoring during construction and information from BIM models. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050086806

These concepts are not identical, but ""digi-tal competency""concept is considered as a key. In this article, we prove that the most suitable approach to training staff for the digital economy is formation of fundamental knowledge as well as developing applied skills. Due to digital platforms, the applied skills realizes funda-mental knowledge through solving practical problems and challenges in the global high-tech market of products and services. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094195339

Smart factories are expected to provide a way of solving the manufacturing industries' complex problems, to take a role in breakthroughs in factories and to carry on a sustainable business. Smart factories are currently in the introduction stage, so we should follow up on the majorities and check their tendencies. However, smart-factory research is an interdisciplinary field that should be studied by researchers with diverse backgrounds in various domains. Thus, studying the past and present overall research trends of smart factory studies is required for their successful introduction and sustainable research. In this study, we explored the research trends of smart factories in both international and specifically Korean research, as an example of a nation case, to determine the major research directions. We determined trends using latent semantic analysis, which is a known topic-modeling technique, and analyzed the trends with regression-based methods. As a result, we could read the clear trends by analyzing existing studies related to smart factories. In addition, it is possible to compare research trends in Korea and international research trends for the commonly appeared topics, such as 'ICT' (Information and Communications Technology) and 'R & D (Research and Development)/Technology Innovation'. We expect that the quantitative analysis results and suggestions presented in this study can be used to formulate strategies for the future diffusion of smart factories. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051119899

Cross-pollinating Product Lifecycle Management and Systems Engineering would benefit both disciplines..

However, there has been a lack of focus on the value that can be generated by using BIM during the design and construction phase. In this paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction processes? A literature review established the main areas to further address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases and into the construction and O&M phases with the use of structured data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further developed. The work also discovers and investigates how an academic institution can develop work methods through on-going development, tests and evaluation in collaboration with practitioners from the AEC industry.

Delays in logistics have a negative impact on assembly processes and vice versa. Incorrect storage or improper transport can lead to damage to the sensitive plant components. All relevant logistical constraints must therefore be systematically analyzed, assessed and evaluated during the planning of construction site and assembly processes. For this purpos e, precise knowledge of the logistical requirements of each individual component is very important. Nowadays this information is not available in digital form and must be elaborately compiled and evaluated manually. The logistical requirements are also essential for the planning of processes. So-called 4D models are already being created and used in plant construction, but storage and transport processes on the construction site are only rudimentarily taken into account. In general, the 4D models only describe the construction process. In order to better investigate and plan construction site logistics using 4D models, the logistical requirements must be identified, classified, generated for each plant component and made available digitally. Therefore, an ontology for the description of logistic boundary conditions and requirements is presented in this paper. The focus is on large-scale plant engineering and the special storage and transport conditions of the various components. The ontology is also a knowledge base to identify which information is required for the planning of construction site logistics and which may need to be added. Then, for example, semi-automatic allocation of storage space can be calculated, an analysis of the utilization of transport equipment can be carried out or the impact on the assembly processes can be determined. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

To connect both worlds, spatio-temporal information can be used to structure and integrate data streams, models and other content such as documents in Enterprise Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). One part of Enterprise SDIs is building information, to support and enhance contextualization of indoor environments and its corresponding information in form of sensor measurements and other digital resources.

While there exists a mature set of project management tools and methods, many of today's projects overrun in terms of both time and cost. Existing literature attributes these overruns to factors such as: unforeseen dependencies, a lack of understanding, late changes, poor communication, limited resource availability (inc. personnel), incomplete data and aspects of culture and planning. Fundamental to overcoming these factors belies the challenge of how management information relating to them can be provided, and done so in a cost eﬀ; ective manner. Motivated by this challenge, recent research has demonstrated how management information can be automatically generated from the evolving digital footprint of an engineering project, which encompasses a broad range of data types and sources. In contrast to existing work that reports the generation, veriﬁcation and application of methods for generating management information, this paper reviews all the reported methods to appraise the scope of management information that can be automatically generated from the digital footprint. In so doing, the paper presents a reference model for the generation of managerial information from the digital footprint, an appraisal of 27 methods, and a critical reﬂection of the scope and generalisability of data-driven project management methods. Key ﬁndings from the appraisal include the role of email in providing insights into potential issues, the role of computer models in automatically eliciting process and product dependencies, and the role of project documentation in assessing project norms. The critical reﬂection also raises issues such as privacy, highlights the enabling technologies, and presents opportunities for new Business Intelligence tools that are based on real-time monitoring and analysis of digital footprints. © 2019",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077161384
