They are systems of collaborating computational entities which are in intensive connection with the surrounding physical world and its on-going processes, providing and using, at the same time, data-accessing and data-processing services available on the Internet. Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), relying on the latest, and the foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th industrial revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4.0. The paper underlines that there are significant roots in general – and in particular to the CIRP community – which point towards CPPS. Expectations towards research in and implementation of CPS and CPPS are outlined and some case studies are introduced.

For a manufacturing enterprise to succeed in this current volatile economic environment, a revolution is needed in restructuring its three main components: product design, manufacturing, and business model. The Global Manufacturing Revolution is the first book to focus on these issues. Based on the author's long-standing course work at the University of Michigan, this unique volume proposes new technologies and new business strategies that can increase an enterprise's speed of responsiveness to volatile markets, as well as enhance the integration of its own engineering and business. Introduced here are innovations to the entire manufacturing culture: An original approach to the analysis of manufacturing paradigms. Suggested methods for developing creativity in product design. A quantitative analysis of manufacturing system configurations. A new manufacturing ""reconfigurable"" paradigm, in which the speed of responsiveness is the prime business goal. An original approach to using information technology for workforce empowerment. The book also offers analysis and original models of previous manufacturing paradigms' technical and business dimensions-including mass production and mass customization-in order to fully explain the current revolution in global manufacturing enterprises. In addition, 200 original illustrations and pictures help to clarify the topics. Globalization is creating both opportunities and challenges for companies that manufacture durable goods. The tools, theories, and case studies in this volume will be invaluable to engineers pursuing leadership careers in the manufacturing industry, as well as to leaders of global enterprises and business students who are motivated to lead manufacturing enterprises and ensure their growth. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Book,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891584447

Traditional six-sigma techniques show strong limitations in highly changeable production contexts, characterized by small batch productions, customized, or even one-of-a-kind products, and in-line product inspections. Innovative and integrated quality, production logistics and maintenance design, management and control methods as well as advanced technological enablers have a key role to achieve the overall production quality goal.

However, these studies focused on the embodied GHG emissions of buildings and were restricted by limited system boundaries due to a lack of detailed on and off-site process data, especially data for assembly and miscellaneous works as well as construction related human activities. This study therefore analyzed GHG emissions during the construction phase of a case study building on the basis of an extended system boundary in the context of China by utilizing detailed onsite process data. The results show that indirect emissions accounted for 97% of all GHG emissions. On-site electricity use and building materials production were the two greatest contributors to direct and indirect emissions respectively. Recombining the construction activities revealed that construction related human activities generated significant GHG emissions (385 tCO2e), which have been ignored in previous research. The findings also reveal that although some materials used during the construction process are negligible in terms of weight, such as polyamide safety nets and aluminum (&lt;0.1%), they have a considerable impact on GHG emissions (2-3%). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931571733

For instance, in 2009 concrete production was superior to 10 billion tons. Cement plays an important role in terms of economic and social relevance since it is fundamental to build and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, this industry is also a heavy polluter. Cement production releases 5-6% of all carbon dioxide generated by human activities, accounting for about 4% of global warming. It can release huge amounts of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins and heavy metals and particles. Energy consumption is also considerable. Cement production use approximately 0.6% of all energy produced in the United States. On the other hand, the chemistry underlying cement production and its applications can be very helpful to overcome these environmental issues. In terms of manufacture, there are many alternative materials that can be used to minimize carbon dioxide production and reduce energy consumption, such as calcium sulfoaluminates and β-Ca2SiO4-rich cements. Using residues from other industrial sectors can also improve the sustainability of cement industry. Under adequate conditions, waste materials such as tyres, oils, municipal solid waste and solvents can be used as supplementary fuel in cement plants. Concrete can be used for encapsulation of waste materials such as tyres, plastics and glasses. In this review, we discuss some aspects of the cement industry associated with environmental science. Other issues such as economic aspects, the chemistry of cement manufacture and its properties are also presented. Special attention is given to the role that cement chemistry can play in terms of sustainability. The most relevant aspects are outlined, such as the use of alternative materials, new possibilities and also the recycling of materials. It is also argued that an important aspect is the role of research and development necessary to improve cement sustainability. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957821872

While the traditional response has been to solve geometric issues onsite at the expense of large rework costs, manufacturing optimisation techniques can mitigate these issues upstream. Tolerance analysis is one such method that is widely used in manufacturing to predict if problems will occur from the accumulation of tolerances and dimensional variability. This article demonstrates Monte Carlo tolerance simulation on a prefabricated construction assembly, where variations up to 37 mm are identified compared to as-built deviations which range up to 30 mm. Process optimisation is also explored, where risk of rework related to dimensional variability is reduced by 65.6% through selection of alternate fabrication processes. To compare the Monte Carlo method to traditional analysis methods, a simplified 1-D tolerance analysis is used. Compared to an as-built deviation of roughly 11 mm, the Monte Carlo method produces a conservative value of 15.4 mm, while other traditional methods are either overly conservative (worst-case tolerance chain has a deviation of 19.8 mm), or overly ambitious (root sum square tolerance chain has a deviation of 4.6 mm). Tolerance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation is shown to be a proactive design tool with several key advantages for prefabricated and offsite construction. First, complex three-dimensional geometric interactions can be readily modelled using very basic tolerance configurations. Secondly, potential misalignments at key connection points can be identified and quantified in terms of a probability distribution of variation. Finally, design improvements can be achieved by comparing alternate construction processes to mitigate the risk of assembly rework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063933117

It combines high-performance steel fiber reinforced concrete in the area of load application with conventional materials used for the remaining regions. A relocation of the gasket to the segments' center proves to provide better protection, and a double hinge neck leads to a more efficient load transfer. The effects of these measures on the structural performance are analyzed experimentally and compared against conventional designs. The results show pronounced increases in bearing capacities by using hybrid reinforcements and provide a quantification of optimization based design modifications. © 2019 fib.

This concept is a specific adaption of the component's inner structure and works in parallel to the optimization of its outer shape which is often limited due to the outer geometry of slabs, walls and supporting pillars. The technology of graded concrete provides an innovative possibility to adapt the inner structure of a concrete component in order to meet defined static and structural-physical requirements. The challenging demands imposed by the technology of graded concrete require a holistic approach including the development of the concrete mixtures, the design of the building components and finally the automatized manufacturing. In collaboration between the departments ILEK, IWB and ISYS of the University of Stuttgart a complete process chain for the manufacturing of functionally graded concrete components was realized.

The RC truss structure is constructed in conventional reinforced concrete. By contrast, the HCS truss structure is designed using ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) and S355 structural steel. Experimental studies demonstrate a 53% reduction in weight of the RC truss structure compared to the reference beam, while achieving a similar load bearing capacity and a significantly higher stiffness, albeit by increasing the structure's height. For the HCS truss structure, the weight saving is considerably higher, namely 83%, whereas the load bearing capacity can be increased by 10%.

This paper proposes an approach for the multi-objective optimization of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing systems. To predict the dynamic effects of several configurations of manufacturing systems, material, energy, and information flows of a discrete event simulation are coupled with an assessment model, based on objectives of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing. Using design of experiments, Gaussian process meta-models are computed for the behavior of the simulation model. These meta-models allow the approximation of the system behavior to be computed in a short period of time and enable extensive multi-objective optimization and more adequate decision-making support systems.

Inspired from stiff structures in the nature as bamboo canes or blades of grass, a circular thin walled cross section is chosen as the key element. The breakthrough of prefabrication of concrete tubes is an integrated heat treatment via tempered water circulation through the inner formwork. It has two benefits, namely to fasten hardening and thus to reduce the cycle times for economic reasons and to anticipate shrinkage in part to increase geometric accuracies. In experimental investigations a self-compacting HPC (NANODUR® concrete) is applied with a water-to-binder ratio of 0.3. Shrinkage of concrete affects the achievable compressive strength of the tubes as vertical cracks due to shortening arise. Otherwise, heating reduces the influence of shrinkage, since it is known that a two days heat treatment on HPC virtually stops the process. The paper presents two aspects. First, a solution to modify the inner stiff steel formwork that prevents the hardening concrete from moving is offered. Thin layers of soft materials as neoprene and foam rubber are applied. Consequently, the strength remains almost unaffected by shrinkage. Second, the effect of heating on the development of strength and shrinkage strains is shown. Initial heating, even short, almost erases an impact on strengths but rather increases bearing capacities as well as decreases shrinkage strains. © Federation Internationale du Beton (fib) - International Federation for Structural Concrete, 2019.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066087786

In the future, the efficient use of materials and energy will have a crucial importance for the implementation of sustainable construction.

In the last two decades UHPC has been used for both structural and non-structural precast components in many countries. However, this outstanding technology has struggled to become a main-stream for everyday use due to lack of design codes and due to initial high investment costs of manufacturing facilities. Moreover, the high UHPC material cost makes it hard to compete with conventional designs optimized for other materials. Most projects in these countries have been motivated by government agencies as demonstration projects intended to encourage further implementation. However, for most of the countries, the follow-up implementation has been slow. Both private and governmental bodies are increasing their directives for the attention and initiative towards exploiting UHPC as a future concrete construction material, in the belief that UHPC technology embraces a more complete solution for sustainable construction with favourable life cycle values.
