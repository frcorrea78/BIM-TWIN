A design structure matrix (DSM) provides a simple, compact, and visual representation of a complex system that supports innovative solutions to decomposition and integration problems. The advantages of DSMs vis-à-vis alternative system representation and analysis techniques have led to their increasing use in a variety of contexts, including product development, project planning, project management, systems engineering, and organization design. This paper reviews two types of DSMs, static and time-based DSMs, and four DSM applications: 1) Component-Based or Architecture DSM, useful for modeling system component relationships and facilitating appropriate architectural decomposition strategies; 2) Team-Based or Organization DSM, beneficial for designing integrated organization structures that account for team interactions; 3) Activity-Based or Schedule DSM, advantageous for modeling the information flow among process activities; and 4) Parameter-Based (or low-level schedule) DSM, effective for integrating low-level design processes based on physical design parameter relationships. A discussion of each application is accompanied by an industrial example. The review leads to conclusions regarding the benefits of DSMs in practice and barriers to their use. The paper also discusses research directions and new DSM applications, both of which may be approached with a perspective on the four types of DSMs and their relationships.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035416239

The technique is useful for developing an understanding of the 'system engineering' needs which arise because of complex interactions between components of a design. This information can be used to define the product architecture and to organize the development teams. The method involves three steps: 1) decomposition of the system into elements, 2) documentation of the interactions between the elements, and 3) clustering the elements into architectural and team chunks. By using this approach, development teams can better understand the complex interactions within the system, thus simplifying the development process for large and complex projects.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028554144

The diagram is based on extending the standard design structure matrix (DSM) to simultaneously show data dependency and process flow on a single diagram. Modifications include adding special components to define iterative processes, defining different line styles to show data and process connections independently, and adding a numbering scheme to define the order in which the components are executed.

New powerful methods are required to model and describe such systems-of-systems (SoS) as a whole. An overall model is required to provide security and reliability assessment taking into account various kinds of threats and failures. A significant challenge associated with this model may be to create what-if scenarios for the analysis of interdependencies. In this paper the interdependencies between industrial control systems (ICS), in particular SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and the underlying critical infrastructures to address the vulnerabilities related to the coupling of these systems are analyzed. The modeling alternatives for system-of-systems, integrated versus coupled models, are discussed. An integrated model contains detailed low level models of (sub)systems as well as a high level model, covering all hierarchical levels. On the other hand, a coupled model aggregates different simulated outputs of the low level models as inputs at a higher level. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches are analyzed and a model architecture for SCADA and the system under control are proposed. Furthermore, the HLA simulation standard is introduced and discussed in this paper as a promising approach to represent interdependencies between infrastructures. To demonstrate the capabilities of the HLA standard for the interdependencies study, an exemplary application and some first results are also briefly presented in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953691099

The need is further highlighted by the challenges arising from the capacity needs of rapid urbanization and the need to renew aging infrastructure. This paper proposes a generalized modeling framework that combines a multilayer network concept with a market-based economic approach to capture the interdependencies among various infrastructure systems with disparate physical and operational characteristics. Thereby, the various infrastructure systems are modeled as individual networks connected through links representing market interactions. The market interactions capture the various types of interdependencies through supply-demand mechanisms. The modeling framework uses a multilayer infrastructure network (MIN) concept, the computable general equilibrium (CGE) theory, and its spatial extension (SCGE), to formulate an equilibrium problem. The mapping between the modeling framework and the real-world context is discussed, followed by a description of the various model components. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the capability of the model to capture various types of interdependencies and to provide insights on the importance of these interdependencies for real-world problems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951518014

These organizations deliver complex projects, rely on digital technologies to manage large data-sets; and use configuration management, a systems engineering approach with mid-20th century origins, to establish and maintain integrity. In them, configuration management has become more, rather than less, important. Asset information is structured, with change managed through digital systems, using relatively hierarchical, asynchronous and sequential processes.

Such a query language enables the spatial analysis of building information models and the extraction of partial models that fulfill certain spatial constraints. Among other features, it includes topological operators, i.e. operators that reflect the topological relationships between 3D spatial objects. The paper presents definitions of the semantics of the topological operators within, contain, touch, overlap, disjoint and equal in 3D space by using the 9-intersection model. It further describes a possible implementation of the topological operators by means of an octree-based algorithm. The recursive algorithm presented in this article relies on a breadth-first traversal of the operands' octree representations and the application of rules that are based on the color of the octants under examination. Because it successively increases the discrete resolution of the spatial objects employed, the algorithm enables the user on the one hand to handle topological relationships in a fuzzy manner and on the other hand to trade-off between computational effort and the required accuracy. The article also presents detailed investigations on the runtime performance of the developed algorithm. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70149125381

Most of the current process modelling tools in the AEC industry do not enable analyses of iterative information cycles. Moreover, these tools represent the process at high levels, thus, they are inadequate for multi-parameter problems like building design. With a view to alleviate these problems, this paper introduces the use of parameter-based design structure matrix as a process modelling and system analysis tool for building design.

Current resilience assessment methods fall short of fully capturing such interdependency effects as they tend to model asset reliability and network flows separately and often rely on static flow assignment methods. In this paper, we develop an integrated, dynamic modelling and simulation framework that combines network and asset representations of infrastructure systems and models the optimal response to disruptions using a rolling planning horizon. The framework considers dependencies pertaining to failure propagation, system-of-systems architecture and resources required for operating and repairing assets. Stochastic asset failure is captured by a scenario tree generation algorithm whereas the redistribution of network flows and the optimal deployment of repair resources are modelled using a minimum cost flow approach.

Most new technologies only deliver value once they are successfully infused into a parent system. However, there has been little research done to develop formal methods to assess the impact of new technology infusion into existing products and systems. In this paper, a systematic framework to quantify and assess the impact of technology infusion early in the product planning cycle is proposed. The proposed methodology quantitatively estimates the impact of technology infusion through the use of a Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and the creation of a Delta DSM (ΔDSM) describing the changes to the original system due to the infused technology. The cost for technology infusion is then estimated from the ΔDSM, and the potential market impact of the technology is calculated based on customer value, expressed through utility curves for system technical performance measures. Finally, the probabilistic ΔNPV of a newly infused technology is obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed methodology was demonstrated on an actual complex printing system, represented as an 84 element DSM with a density of 3.7%, where a newly developed value-enhancing technology was infused into the existing product. The result shows that a positive marginal net present value ΔNPV can be expected, despite the new technology causing an invasiveness of 8.5% to the existing design. The methodology can be applied in a rigorous and repeatable manner, opening up possibilities for further implementation of the proposed framework, including analysis of the interactions amongst multiple technologies. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649567100

Failure to consider these interactions and dependencies can lead to costly overruns, failure to meet requirements, and lengthy redesigns. Thus, the management and monitoring of these dependencies remains a crucial activity in engineering projects and is becoming ever more challenging with the increase in the number of components, component interactions, and component dependencies, in both a structural and a functional sense. For these reasons, tools and methods to support the identification and monitoring of component interactions and dependencies continues to be an active area of research. In particular, design structure matrices (DSMs) have been extensively applied to identify and visualize product and organizational architectures across a number of engineering disciplines. However, the process of generating these DSMs has primarily used surveys, structured interviews, and/or meetings with engineers. As a consequence, there is a high cost associated with engineers' time alongside the requirement to continually update the DSM structure as a product develops. It follows that the proposition of this paper is to investigate whether an automated and continuously evolving DSM can be generated by monitoring the changes in the digital models that represent the product. This includes models that are generated from computer-aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics systems. The paper shows that a DSM generated from the changes in the product models corroborates with the product architecture as defined by the engineers and results from previous DSM studies. In addition, further levels of product architecture dependency were also identified. A particular affordance of automatically generating DSMs is the ability to continually generate DSMs throughout the project. This paper demonstrates the opportunity for project managers to monitor emerging product dependencies alongside changes in modes of working between the engineers.

Two types of functions are distinguished: functions specifying what functionality a particular component provides to another component, and functions specifying the internal working (transformation of flow) of a particular component. The fixed grammar for the specification of the two types of functions allows for the automated derivation of dependencies between components, between functions of components, and between system parameters. A case study on a navigation lock demonstrates that the system architecture generated from function specifications matches the architecture of the real lock system fairly well.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a recent technology for developing product models in AEC industry and Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is a proved process modelling tool, capable of representing iterations in design process and optimising sequences. A pilot case study of integrating DSM with Industry Foundation classes (IFC), an open format of BIM, is used to demonstrate working of the model. © ASCE 2012.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866261229
