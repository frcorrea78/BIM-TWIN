The implications (in terms of time and cost) of extra work associated with deficiencies in manual data collection and transfer are not well quantified. In this paper, a simulation-based framework is used to model information flow processes from a job site to a field office to measure and highlight existing deficiencies, and to model and demonstrate the effect of using automated reality capture technologies (laser scanners and radio frequency identification), in streamlining the data collection process for the same project. The simulation results showed that the NVA times of each agent involved in the information flow can be reduced by utilizing data collection technologies. This framework can be used by researchers and construction practitioners to identify inefficiencies in the current information flow at sites quantitatively and understand the benefits of using automated reality capture technologies to reduce these inefficiencies. © 2006 ASCE.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750122910

Thanks to its many advantages, BIM is already practiced in many construction projects throughout the entire world. However, the fragmented nature of the construction industry still impedes its more widespread use. Government initiatives around the world play an important role in increasing BIM adoption: as the largest client of the construction industry in many countries, the state has the power to significantly change its work practices. This chapter discusses the motivation for applying BIM, offers a detailed definition of BIM along with an overview of typical use cases, describes the common BIM maturity grades and reports on BIM adoption levels in various countries around the globe. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

These systems have been developed independently and it seems beneficial to link and combine the information available in these single systems to enable a global optimization of the production processes. An integrated system collects and stores data from sensor-equipped construction machines to connect them with information from the planning phase, thereby leading to a higher level of transparency. This transparency can be used to identify bottlenecks and unproductive working times such as waiting periods. The system can provide assistance for the construction manager to detect reasons for these kinds of distractions. Hereby a continuous improvement process is induced. This paper will introduce the described system above and show the benefits of the merged use of current developments in information technologies. Moreover, it represents the ongoing development of a system prototype.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874505946
