However, before being fully implemented in the national building codes and international standards, the ZEB concept requires clear and consistent definition and a commonly agreed energy calculation methodology. The most important issues that should be given special attention before developing a new ZEB definition are: (1) the metric of the balance, (2) the balancing period, (3) the type of energy use included in the balance, (4) the type of energy balance, (5) the accepted renewable energy supply options, (6) the connection to the energy infrastructure and (7) the requirements for the energy efficiency, the indoor climate and in case of gird connected ZEB for the building-grid interaction. This paper focuses on the review of the most of the existing ZEB definitions and the various approaches towards possible ZEB calculation methodologies. It presents and discusses possible answers to the abovementioned issues in order to facilitate the development of a consistent ZEB definition and a robust energy calculation methodology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is recognized that the sole satisfaction of an annual balance is not sufficient to fully characterize Net ZEBs and the interaction between buildings and energy grids need to be addressed. It is also recognized that different definitions are possible, in accordance with a country's political targets and specific conditions. This paper presents a consistent framework for setting Net ZEB definitions. Evaluation of the criteria in the definition framework and selection of the related options becomes a methodology to set Net ZEB definitions in a systematic way. The balance concept is central in the definition framework and two major types of balance are identified, namely the import/export balance and the load/generation balance. As compromise between the two a simplified monthly net balance is also described. Concerning the temporal energy match, two major characteristics are described to reflect a Net ZEB's ability to match its own load by on-site generation and to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grids. Possible indicators are presented and the concept of grid interaction flexibility is introduced as a desirable target in the building energy design. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the concept of 'net energy' is introduced and applied within the built environment, based on a methodology accounting for the embodied energy of building components together with energy use in operation.

An analysis of the characteristics of the wind power resource of the United Kingdom has been carried out, based on modelling of hourly observed wind speed data from 66 onshore weather recording sites for the period 1970-2003. Patterns of wind power availability are presented, with the data demonstrating that the output from large-scale wind power development in the UK has distinct patterns of monthly and hourly variability. The extent and frequency of high and low wind power events is assessed, and wind power data are matched with electricity demand data to examine the relationship between wind power output and electricity demand. It is demonstrated that wind power output in the UK has a weak, positive correlation to current electricity demand patterns; during peak demand periods, the capacity factor of wind power in the UK is around 30% higher than the annual average capacity factor.

But even if the best design practices are widely adopted and implemented, this will only mitigate global warming. It is too late to prevent it. Yet buildings - including net-zero energy buildings - are often designed using historical data representing the average climate between 1961 and 1990, or between 1976 and 2005 at best.This paper investigates the use of the downscaling method known as "" morphing"" , proposed by Belcher et al. (2005), to generate weather data files. The impact of using these weather files on the energy performance of an actual NZEB is then assessed. Morphing is applied to typical "" horizon years"" representative of future climate and also on a month-by-month and year-by-year basis using raw data from a selected GCM. A 50-year series of hourly weather data is obtained and analyzed for two different locations, Montréal (QC) and Massena (NY). The data are then used to simulate the performance of a net-zero energy home as it was designed using historical data. The results show that the building misses the net-zero energy target for most years. The year-to-year variability of the total energy use is relatively small but the impact on the energy excess or shortage in relation to the net-zero target is significant. climate-sensitive buildings such as NZEBs should always be designed using multi-year simulations with weather data that take climate change into account. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860435670

For these reasons, a particular building, like an organism or an ecosystem, must seek self-sustenance for that design to prevail in competition with other building designs in a time with limited availability of energy and materials. To this extent, Net Zero Energy (NZE) buildings achieve a net annual energy balance in their operations. However, approaching an NZE building goal based on current definitions is flawed for two principal reasons (1) NZE only deals with the energy required for operations and related emissions (2) it does not establish a threshold which ensures that buildings are optimized for reduced consumption before renewable systems are integrated to obtain an energy balance.

Currently, the on-site options are much more popular than the off-site; however, taking into consideration the limited area of roof and/or façade, primarily in the dense city areas, the Danish weather conditions, the growing interest and number of wind turbine co-ops, the off-site renewable energy supply options could become a meaningful solution for reaching 'zero' energy goal in the Danish context. Therefore, this paper deploys the life cycle cost analysis and takes the private economy perspective to investigate the life cycle cost of different renewable energy supply options, and to identify the cost-optimal combination between energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. The analysis includes five technologies, i.e., two on-site options: (1) photovoltaic, (2) micro combined heat and power, and three off-site options: (1) off-site windmill, (2) share of a windmill farm and (3) purchase of green energy from the 100% renewable utility grid. The results indicate that in case of the on-site renewable supply options, the energy efficiency should be the first priority in order to design a cost-optimal Net ZEB.

Specifically, a sequential search technique is utilized to optimize the design of residential buildings in several locations within the MENA region in order to minimize life cycle energy costs using a wide range of energy efficiency measures. In the analysis, design features of air-conditioned single-family homes are considered including orientation, window location and size, glazing type, wall and roof insulation levels, lighting fixtures, appliances, and efficiencies of heating and cooling systems. First, optimal design features for net-zero energy single-family homes are determined for over 160 MENA locations. In particular, the potential energy use savings obtained for the optimal designs as well as the size of the photovoltaic panels required for net-zero energy residential building designs are estimated for the MENA sites. The impacts of both energy cost subsidies and cost variations for implementing energy efficiency measures are evaluated for selected MENA countries. In particular, it is found that optimal designs can cost-effectively reduce the annual energy use typically by 50% compared to the current design practices of homes through most countries in the MENA region. However, the cost-effectiveness of these optimal designs is found to be highly dependent on the level for energy prices and the implementation costs of energy efficiency measures. The sensitivity analysis results clearly show that the best policy to promote energy-efficient and net-zero energy buildings is to reduce and ultimately eliminate energy subsidies in the MENA region. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Different plans are being promoted by member states to reach this goal, to increase the number of NZEBs and to facilitate the retrofit of existing constructions. Within this frame, several analyses of cost benefits have been developed to evaluate the economic effectiveness of retrofit interventions. The economic analysis can be extended to the energy and environmental fields introducing various indicators, such as energy and environmental payback times, to describe the effectiveness of the retrofit intervention from a more extensive point of view. In this paper, we considered a school building located in Turin (Northern Italy) with the scope of evaluating the energy and carbon payback times of different retrofit scenarios that could be implemented for the existing building. An optimal cost retrofit and two NZEB retrofits were considered, varying envelope insulation, heat generation and lighting systems, shading and control devices. First, we simulated the building's energy consumption and calibrated the results with data from actual energy bills. The calibrated model was used for evaluation of the building's energy demand after the proposed retrofit interventions. We then applied the Life-Cycle-Analysis (LCA) for the calculation of environmental payback times. The results showed that the NZEB retrofit produces energy and environmental payback times that are shorter than the life cycle of the building. In the foreseeable future, solutions such as these could prove effective in addressing issues that arise from global warming and energy supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055662148

Firstly, this paper introduced the target of energy-saving reformation of existing residential buildings in North China and the importance of check and evaluation on this target, then pointed out the necessity of building up an evaluation system for energy-saving retrofit. According to the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), three-grade evaluation system was built up for heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of China. Also, based on multi-index comprehensive evaluation method combined with life cycle assessment (LCA) theory, post-evaluation thought and successful degree evaluation method, a mathematical model was established. Finally, a set of scientific method for evaluating heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of China systematically, scientifically, comprehensively and objectively was created. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This requires highly performing dwellings, an arena previously the preserve of the Passive House (PH) Standard. This study examines the operational performance and cost of a set of nZEB dwellings built as PH dwellings and thereby investigates the potential of the PH typology as a solution to nZEB. This investigation is undertaken with particular focus on the context of social housing, given that this will account for a considerable portion (c.40%) of housebuilding in the next 10 years within some EU jurisdictions. Detailed construction cost comparisons are presented for an nZEB compliant PH dwelling (which is part of a scheme of 12 such dwellings) and compared to a similar dwelling which is constructed to comply with the current building regulations in the Republic of Ireland. The Indoor Environmental (IEQ) conditions, energy consumption and monitored cost of heating and ventilation are also presented. In addition, the paper presents the results of a comprehensive occupant satisfaction survey and extensive post occupancy monitoring and analysis for the scheme of PH dwellings. Finally it compares the monitored performance with that of 20 “standard” and PH dwellings, a number of which are nZEB compliant. While the study uses data across the UK and Ireland it has relevance to a much wider context for the deployment of nZEB in Europe and housing globally, and in particular the provision of social housing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054401213

All of these actions increase ground-borne noise and vibrations that negatively affect people who work, stay, or reside nearby the railway lines. In order to mitigate these phenomena, many techniques have been developed and studied but there is a serious lack of life-cycle information regarding such the methods in order to make a well-informed and sustainable decision. The aim of this study is to evaluate the life-cycle performance of mitigation methods that can enhance sustainability and efficacy in the railway industry. The emphasis of this study is placed on new methods for ground-borne noise and vibration mitigation including metamaterials, geosynthetics, and ground improvement. To benchmark all of these methods, identical baseline assumptions and the life-cycle analysis over 50 years have been adopted where relevant. This study also evaluates and highlights the impact of extreme climate conditions on the life-cycle cost of each method. It is found that the anti-resonator method is the most expensive methods compared with the others whilst the use of geogrids (for subgrade stiffening) is relatively reliable when used in combination with ground improvements. The adverse climate has also played a significant role in all of the methods. However, it was found that sustainable methods, which are less sensitive to extreme climate, are associated with the applications of geosynthetic materials such as geogrids, composites, etc. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055091878

This paper evaluates efficient and feasible approaches to recovering and recycling wasted rolling stocks. The emphasis is placed on three broad train types, consisting of freight train, passenger train, and High-Speed Rail (HSR). In this article, all compositions of the three types of rolling stock are studied, with the results of the recyclability and recoverability rates being used to inform their productive treatment at the end-of-life. The distinctive point of this research is an analysis of compositions, materials, and the percentage of value adopted from the end-of-life rolling stocks. With respect to find out the recyclability (Rcyc) and recoverability (Rcov) rates on end-of-life rolling stock, the equations are adopted from ISO 22,628:2002 document to estimate the feasibility and suitability of each component on the rolling stock for taking advantage from unused parts. By comparing the Rcyc and Rcov rates among three types of rolling stock at the end-of-life stage, the highest value of Rcyc showed at 92.8% from freight train where the highest value of Rcov represented at 12.5% from HSR. It was found that those rates relate to the main components on rolling stock, which contained diversely characteristic to be reusable, recyclable or recoverable materials. Finally, the two key recommendations for further design on rolling stocks are provided regarding the proper selection of materials and the method to enhance efficiency of recycling and recovering process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297387

Such progressive disinvestment in the non-renewable resources that may be substituted with renewable resources is referred to as ""Renewable Substitutability"" and if implemented, this process will lead to a paradigm shift in the way building materials are manufactured. This paper discusses the development of a Renewable Substitutability Index (RSI) that is designed to maximize the use of renewable resources in a building and quantifies the substitution process using solar emergy (i.e., the solar equivalent joules required for any item). The RSI of a building or a building component, i.e., floor or wall systems, etc., is the ratio of the renewable resources used during construction, including replacement and maintenance, to the building's maximum renewable emergy potential. RSI values range between 0 and 1.0. A higher RSI achieves a low-energy building strategy promoting a higher order of sustainability by optimizing the use of renewables over a building's lifetime from formation-extraction-manufacturing to maintenance, operation, demolition, and recycle. © 2015 by the authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958761582
