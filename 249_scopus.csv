BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not generally capture details of a facility as it was actually built. Laser scanners can be used to capture dense 3D measurements of a facility's as-built condition and the resulting point cloud can be manually processed to create an as-built BIM-a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone process that could benefit significantly from automation. This article surveys techniques developed in civil engineering and computer science that can be utilized to automate the process of creating as-built BIMs. We sub-divide the overall process into three core operations: geometric modeling, object recognition, and object relationship modeling. We survey the state-of-the-art methods for each operation and discuss their potential application to automated as-built BIM creation. We also outline the main methods used by these algorithms for representing knowledge about shape, identity, and relationships. In addition, we formalize the possible variations of the overall as-built BIM creation problem and outline performance evaluation measures for comparing as-built BIM creation algorithms and tracking progress of the field. Finally, we identify and discuss technology gaps that need to be addressed in future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619234

These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the ""as-is"" conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large, highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873283130

Based on the collected papers, applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry are reviewed according to three categories including (1) 3D model reconstruction, (2) geometry quality inspection, and (3) other applications. Following the literature review, this paper discusses on the acquisition and processing of point cloud data, particularly focusing on how to properly perform data acquisition and processing to fulfill the needs of the intended construction applications. Specifically, the determination of required point cloud data quality and the determination of data acquisition parameters are discussed with regard to data acquisition, and the extraction and utilization of semantic information and the platforms for data visualization and processing are discussed with regard to data processing.

Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end, this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps: (1) data capturing and processing, (2) object recognition, and (3) as-is BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed. Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are identified.

Different ontology development methodologies and frameworks have been reviewed. These have informed the development of a building monitoring ontology framework and its underpinning ontologies (sensor ontology, building ontology, and other supporting ontologies). The resulting ontologies have been tested and validated following a two-staged approach. The development renders a system that delivers demonstrable rationality and robustness within the dynamic environment in which it operates. The capture of semantics through formal expression to model the environment adds a richness that the agents exploit to intelligently determine behaviours to satisfy goals that are flexible and adaptable.

This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules.

This ""deviation analysis"" approach to QA enables users to analyze the regions with significant differences between the 3D data and the reconstructed model or between the 3D data of individual laser scans. This method can help identify the sources of errors and does not require additional physical access to the facility. To show the approach's potential effectiveness, we conducted case studies of several professionally conducted as-is BIM projects.

It is not just the external environment that will affect the context but that thinking itself modifies further action and context occurs at a conceptual level that exists within a social setting. Thus, a situated view of knowledge necessitates knowledge acquisition techniques which handle change. This is particularly true of design knowledge where the design will change as more experience is gained and the changing model will itself change the perception of a design while designing. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that knowledge is always evolving and the premise that it is not easy to capture or evaluate a conceptual model. The alternative offered is based on the combined use of cases, ripple-down rules (RDR), formal concept analysis (FCA) and the Activity/Space (A/S) ontology. Cases are design episodes and used to motivate the capture of rules in a simple u ser-driven manner. Cases ground the KBS in the real world and provide the context in which the knowledge applies. Rules are the indexes by which the cases are retrieved. Using FCA, we are able to build an abstraction hierarchy of the rules and cases. To facilitate comparison and validation we use A/S design ontology to acquire a consistently organised set of cases. This ontology provides a common structure and shared set of descriptive terms. The ease with which the knowledge is acquired and maintained using RDR, the use of a dynamic design ontology and the automatic generation of conceptual models using FCA allows for the continual evolution of the KBS in keeping with the notion that knowledge is continually evolving and 'made-up' to fit the situation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
