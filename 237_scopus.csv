These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology.

Despite technological advancements of information and knowledge management in the building and construction industry, a link between safety management and information models is still missing. The objective of this study is to investigate a new approach to organize, store and re-use construction safety knowledge. A construction safety ontology is proposed to formalize the safety management knowledge. It consists of three main domain ontology models, including Construction Product Model, Construction Process Model, and Construction Safety Model. One-on-one expert interviews were conducted for ontology evaluation. The interaction between safety ontology and Building Information Modeling (BIM) is also explored. A prototype application of ontology-based job hazard analysis (JHA) and visualization is implemented to further illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed ontology. The developed construction safety ontology enables more effective inquiry of safety knowledge, which is the first step towards automated safety planning for JHA using BIM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998890667

This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain.

However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web. In this paper we propose the use of linked data as an enabling technology for cloud-based building data services.

However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Protégé 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules.

This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs - a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field.

In order to ensure interoperability, data models are pivotal. In this sense, this paper presents an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)based interoperable framework for building linked-data, where static and dynamic data are integrated in a harmonized way for the CARTIF-III building. For this purpose, a BIM (Building Information Modelling)-centred framework has been designed, where BIM contains all the static information modelled from the building, including sensors. A dynamic database is modelled under the IFC paradigm to be able to link data between both repositories and, thus, keep record of dynamic data that the building periodically generates. With the aim of demonstrating its functionality, CARTIF-III building has been used where, on one hand, BIM model deals with thermal zones and sensors. On the other hand, dynamic database stores data coming from the “modelled” sensors, as well as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The key point is the integration of both data resources so that self-inspection procedures could be applied in buildings. © 2018 CEUR-WS.
