The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small-but not minimum-number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion.

This paper contributes in solving this problem by applying automated safety rule checking to Building Information Models (BIM). Algorithms that automatically analyze a building model to detect safety hazards and suggest preventive measures to users are developed for different cases involving fall related hazards. As BIM is changing the way construction can be approached, the presented work and case studies extend BIM to include automated hazard identification and correction during construction planning and in certain cases, during design. A rule-based engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents before construction starts. The safety area reviewed is fall protection. An example case study of such a system is also provided. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869092675

This entails project managers to design, implement, and maintain a systematic approach for construction progress monitoring to promptly identify, process and communicate discrepancies between actual and as-planned performances. To achieve this goal, this research focuses on exploring application of unsorted daily progress photograph logs available on any construction site as a data collection technique. Our approach is based on computing-from the images themselves-the photographer's locations and orientations, along with a sparse 3D geometric representation of the as-built site using daily progress photographs and superimposition of the reconstructed scene over as-planned 4D models. Within such an environment, progress photographs are registered in the virtual as-planned environment and this allows a large unstructured collection of daily construction images to be sorted, interactively browsed and explored. In addition, sparse reconstructed scenes superimposed over 4D models allow site images to be geo-registered with the as-planned components and consequently, location-based image processing technique to be implemented and progress data to be extracted automatically. The results of progress comparison between as-planned and as-built performances are visualized in the D4AR (4D Augmented Reality) environment using a traffic light metaphor. We present our preliminary results on three ongoing construction projects and discuss implementation, perceived benefits and future potential enhancement of this new technology in construction, in all fronts of automatic data collection, processing and communication. © 2009 The authors.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350154917

Rapid project assessment further identifies discrepancies between the as-built and as-planned progress, and facilitates decision making on the necessary remedial actions. Currently, manual visual observations and surveying are the most dominant data capturing techniques but they are time-consuming, error-prone, and infrequent, making quick and reliable decision-making difficult. Therefore, research on new approaches that allow automatic recognition of as-built performance and visualization of construction progress is essential. This paper presents and compares two methods for obtaining point cloud models for detection and visualization of as-built status for construction projects: (1) A new method of automated image-based reconstruction and modeling of the as-built project status using unordered daily construction photo collections through analysis of Structure from Motion (SfM); (2) 3D laser scanning and analysis of the as-built dense point cloud models. These approaches provide robust means for recognition of progress, productivity, and quality on a construction site. In this paper, an overview of the newly developed automated image-based reconstruction approach and exclusive features which distinct it from other image-based or conventional photogrammetric techniques is presented. Subsequently the terrestrial laser scanning approach carried out for reconstruction and comparison of as-built scenes is presented. Finally the accuracy and usability of both of these techniques for metric reconstruction, automated production of point cloud models, 3D CAD shape modeling, and as-built visualizations is evaluated and compared on eight different case studies. It is shown that for precise defect detection or alignment tasks, image-based point cloud models may not be as accurate and dense as laser scanners' point cloud models. Nonetheless image-based point cloud models provide an opportunity to extract as-built semantic information (i.e., progress, productivity, quality and safety) through the content of the images, are easy to use, and do not need add burden on the project management teams by requiring expertise for data collection or analysis. Finally image-based reconstruction automatically provides photo alignment with point cloud models and enables image-based renderings which can remarkably impact automated performance monitoring and as-built visualizations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to investigate how potential fall hazards that are unknowingly built into the construction schedule can be identified and eliminated early in the planning phase of a construction project. A survey of research on construction safety and BIM is presented first. Then, a framework was developed that includes automated safety rule-checking algorithms for BIM. The developed prototype was tested using models including an office and a residential building project in Finland. The first case study highlights the comparison of manual vs. automated safety modeling of fall protective systems. It also describes the details to multiple design and as-built scenarios where protective safety equipment is modeled. The second case study presents results of applying the framework to the project schedule. It specifically simulates fall hazard detection and prevention. The contribution of this work is an automated rule-checking framework that integrates safety into BIM effectively and provides practitioners with a method for detecting and preventing fall-related hazards.

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

Falls remain a major concern as they contribute to very serious injuries or even fatalities on construction projects around the world. Since the standards and rules for protective safety equipment vary by country, the growing numbers of internationally operating companies are in need of tools that allow ubiquitous understanding and planning of safety regardless of the country where they operate. The problem is examined using a customizable automatic safety rule-checking platform for building information models. The applied rule-based checking algorithms are designed to be add-ons to existing building information modelling (BIM) software and can check models for safety hazards early in the design and planning process. Once hazards have been identified preventative safety equipment can be designed, estimated, and included in the construction schedule before construction starts. A case study implements the safety rule-checking platform on a high-rise building project. Fall protection regulations from both the USA and Germany are applied to the developed rule-checking platform. Visualization of the safety information further explains the differences in the results once country-specific safety-regulative standards are applied on the same building information model.

The research presented here, describes a concept for an automated comparison of the actual state of construction with the planned state for the early detection of deviations in the construction process. The actual state of the construction site is detected by photogrammetric surveys. From these recordings, dense point clouds are generated by the fusion of disparity maps created with semi-global-matching (SGM). These are matched against the target state provided by a 4D Building Information Model (BIM). For matching the point cloud and the BIM, the distances between individual points of the cloud and a component's surface are aggregated using a regular cell grid. For each cell, the degree of coverage is determined. Based on this, a confidence value is computed which serves as basis for the existence decision concerning the respective component. Additionally, process- And dependency-relations are included to further enhance the detection process. Experimental results from a real-world case study are presented and discussed.

This article presents initial results on the Inferential Theory of Learning that aims at developing such a framework, with the primary emphasis on explaining logical capabilities of learning systems, i.e., their competence. The theory views learning as a goal-oriented process of modifying the learner's knowledge by exploring the learner's experience. Such a process is described as a search through a knowledge space, conducted by applying knowledge transformation operators, called knowledge transmutations. Transmutations can be performed using any type of inference—deduction, induction, or analogy. Several fundamental pairs of transmutations are presented in a novel and very general way. These include generalization and specialization, explanation and prediction, abstraction and concretion, and similization and dissimilization. Generalization and specialization transmutations change the reference set of a description (the set of entities being described). Explanations and predictions derive additional knowledge about the reference set (explanatory or predictive). Abstractions and concretions change the level of detail in describing a reference set. Similizations and dissimilizations hypothesize knowledge about a reference set based on its similarity or dissimilarity with another reference set. The theory provides a basis for multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL), which is outlined and illustrated by an example. MTL dynamically adapts strategies to the learning task, defined by the input information, the learner's background knowledge, and the learning goal. It aims at synergistically integrating a wide range of inferential learning strategies, such as empirical and constructive inductive generalization, deductive generalization, abductive derivation, abstraction, similization, and others. © 1993, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Whereas the philosophy of form and function is a well-researched topic, the practical relations and dependencies between form and function are only known implicitly by designers and architects. Specifically, the formal modelling of structural forms and resulting artefactual functions within design and design assistance systems remains elusive. In our work, we aim at making these definitions explicit by ontologically modelling respective domain entities, their properties and related constraints. We interpret ""(structural) form"" and ""(artefactual) function"" by specifying modular ontologies and their interplay for the architectural design domain. A key aspect in our modelling approach is the use of formal conceptual requirements and qualitative spatial calculi as a link between the structural form of a design and the differing functional capabilities that it affords or leads to.

One important example herein is the allocation and dimensioning of resources (e.g., building materials and equipment) which is typically carried out by humans according to clearly defined rules and best practices. This paper presents model-based rule checking for the planning of construction site layouts. We demonstrate that existing Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS), such as the open-source rule engine Drools, can be used. We combine Drools with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to retrieve data from a building information model and use the information within the rule engine. We define general model requirements and implement a sample set of prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset geometry for rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between temporary construction site elements. The developed approaches are explained and evaluated in field-realistic, practical case studies.

Large to small organisations throughout the entire construction supply chain continue to be challenged to adequately prevent accidents. Construction worker injuries and fatalities represent significant waste of resources. Although the five C's (culture, competency, communication, controls and contractors) have been focusing on compliance, good practices and best-in-class strategies, even industry leaders have only marginal improvements in recorded safety statistics for many years. Design/methodology/approach - Right-time vs real-time construction safety and health identifies three major focus areas to aid in the development of a strategic, as opposed to tactical, response. Occupational safety and health by design, real-time safety and health monitoring and alerts and education, training and feedback leveraging state-of-the-art technology provide meaningful predictive, quantitative and qualitative measures to identify, correlate and eliminate hazards before workers get injured or incidents cause collateral damage. Findings - The current state and development of existing innovative initiatives in the occupational construction safety and health domain are identified.

The overall research goal was to increase understanding of the role that owners of constructed facilities can play in adopting PtD on their capital projects. A total of 65 face-to-face interviews and 79 anonymous surveys were completed at four case-study organizations in addition to 103 surveys completed online by members of national construction associations and organizations. Industry survey data indicate that while the majority of owner firm employees had not heard of PtD, they find the concept compelling and do not anticipate significant barriers to its implementation. Key empirical findings indicate that (1) an explicit PtD process is required for implementation; (2) proactive owner leadership and involvement are necessary to initiate PtD on a project; (3) owner leadership is required both to set high expectations for worker safety and health and to ensure general contractor and trade contractor personnel participation in the design review process; and (4) supporting tools, such as design checklists, four dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and risk identification and assessment documents, facilitate the PtD process.

We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic geospatial domains. Building on formal methods in the areas of commonsense reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation and reasoning, reasoning about actions and change and computational models of narrative, we identify concrete theoretical and practical challenges that accrue in the context of formal reasoning about space, events, actions and change.

The conventional literature review presented here is based on the conceptual landscape that was obtained from the bibliometric and scientometric analysis in the first part of the study. Seven main academic research directions concerning the BIM-based EoL domain were found, including social and cultural factors, BIM-based Design for Deconstruction (DfD), BIM-based deconstruction, BIM-based EoL within LCA, BIM-aided waste management, Material and Component Banks (M/C Banks), off-site construction, interoperability and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The analysis highlights research gaps in the path of raw materials to reusable materials, i.e., from the deconstruction to M/C banks to DfD-based designs and then again to deconstruction. BIM-based EoL is suffering from a lack of a global framework. The existing solutions are based on local waste management policies and case-specific sustainability criteria selection. Another drawback of these ad hoc but well-developed BIM-based EoL prototypes is their use of specific proprietary BIM tools to support their framework. This disconnection between BIM tools and EoL tools is reportedly hindering the BIM-based EoL, while no IFC classes support the EoL phase information exchange. © 2020 by the authors.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083586987

The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) at the start of the millennium has sparked useful research in the area of sharing building information effectively; but, challenges remain with producing a practical and manageable regulatory knowledge representation that can be processed effectively by a compliance checking system. Research is being conducted to develop a two-part regulatory knowledge representation which can be maintained independently by designers and regulators. One part is a set of compliant design procedures modelled as Business Process Diagrams (BPD) using an open standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The other part is the associated regulatory constraints and rules encoded in a computable format suitable for execution with the BPMN. This paper reports on a set of guidelines developed for the purposes of encoding regulatory knowledge into the proposed computable representation. A verification method (C/VM2) prescribed by the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) for the performance-based design of buildings related to fire safety has been selected as a case study to illustrate the encoding process.

The automotive or ship building industries, for example, have stringent production planning methods in place to the point that almost every step in the planning and manufacturing processes is supported by digital simulation and optimization. On the other hand, construction planning appears to remain a manual process slowly taking advantage of building information modeling (BIM) processes and techniques. Our work investigates automated rulebased checking in construction site layout planning tasks to simplify the existing manual processes. A gap analysis of the traditional site layout planning process is performed to identify key areas that are of high concern to practitioners. A rule-based checking algorithm for site layout planning embedded in a commercially-available BIM-platform was created and tested on specific cases in the site layout planning process of a realistic building.

We define a formal model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with penalties into logic programs with weak constraints.

Semantic enrichment using artificial intelligence (AI) can automate much of this normalization process. Progress in the field of semantic enrichment, in turn, requires identification and specification of the information types that must be made explicit, and of the procedures appropriate for each type. After characterizing a broad set of clauses from five diverse building codes, a two-stage clustering process with the k-means algorithm was used to derive a hierarchical classification of semantic enrichment task types. The resulting classification defines 10 tasks that are typically needed for automated code compliance checking.

The research on the phenomenon has recently been much advanced; however, the analyses have been carried out only for concrete, steel, and masonry structures, while pounding between wooden buildings has not been studied so far. The aim of this paper is to show the results of detailed non-linear seismic analysis of inter-story pounding between the wood-framed buildings modelled by using the finite element method. Firstly, the modal analysis of the structures was conducted. Then, the detailed non-linear analysis of earthquake-induced collisions between two wood-framed buildings of different heights was carried out. The results of the analysis indicate that the behavior of both structures in the longitudinal as well as in the transverse direction is significantly influenced by interactions. The response of the taller building is increased in both directions. On the other hand, the response of the lower building is decreased in the longitudinal direction, while it is increased in the transverse one. The results of the study presented in the paper indicate that, due to deformability of buildings made of wood, structural interactions may change their responses much more, as compared to steel, reinforced concrete, or masonry structures. © 2019 by the authors.
