We show how repeated bottom-up, top-down processing used in conjunction with intermediate supervision is critical to improving the performance of the network. We refer to the architecture as a “stacked hourglass” network based on the successive steps of pooling and upsampling that are done to produce a final set of predictions.

The use of cluster analysis presents a complex challenge because it requires several methodological choices that determine the quality of a cluster solution. This paper chronicles the application of cluster analysis in strategic management research, where the technique has been used since the late 1970s to investigate issues of central importance. Analysis of 45 published strategy studies reveals that the implementation of cluster analysis has been often less than ideal, perhaps detracting from the ability of studies to generate knowledge. Given these findings, suggestions are offered for improving the application of cluster analysis in future inquiry.",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030373901

Second, the spaces are parsed into their structural and building elements (e.g. walls, columns, etc). Performing these with a strong notation of global 3D space is the backbone of our method. The alignment in the first step injects strong 3D priors from the canonical coordinate system into the second step for discovering elements. This allows diverse challenging scenarios as man-made indoor spaces often show recurrent geometric patterns while the appearance features can change drastically. We also argue that identification of structural elements in indoor spaces is essentially a detection problem, rather than segmentation which is commonly used.

Starting with a point cloud of a scene - generated using laser scanners or image-based reconstruction methods - the user must first identify collections of points that belong to individual surfaces, and then, fit surfaces and solid geometry objects appropriate for the analysis. When performed manually, this task is often prohibitively time consuming and, in response, several research groups have recently focused on developing methods for automating the modeling process. Due to the limitations of the data collection processes as well as the complexity of as-built scenes, automated 3D modeling still presents many challenges. To overcome existing limitations, in this paper, we propose a new region growing method for robust context-free segmentation of unordered point clouds based on geometrical continuities. In our method, the user sets a single parameter which accounts for the desired level of abstraction. We treat this parameter as a locally adaptive threshold to account for local context. Our method of segmentation starts with a multi-scale feature detection, describing surface roughness and curvature around each 3D point, and is followed by seed finding and region growing steps. Experimental results from seven challenging point clouds of the built environment demonstrate that our method can account for variability in point cloud density, surface roughness, curvature, and clutter within a single scene. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The state-of-the-art methods for fitting primitives, non-uniform B-Spline surface (NURBS) and solid geometry to point clouds still fail to account for all the topological variations or struggle with mapping of physical space to parameter space given unordered, incomplete, and noisy point clouds. Assuming an input of points that can be described by a single non-self-intersecting NURBS, this article presents a new method that leverages segmented point clouds and outputs NURBS surfaces. It starts by successively fitting uniform B-Spline curves in two-dimensional as planar cross-sectional cuts on each surface. An intermediate B-Spline surface is then computed by globally optimizing and lofting over the cross-sections. This surface is used to parameterize the points and perform final refinement to a NURBS. For cylindrical segments such as pipes, a new supervised method is also introduced to string the fitted segments, identify connection types, standardize the connections, and then refine them using NURBS optimization.

The main chanllenge for learning on point clouds is to capture local structures or relationships. Graph convolution has the strong ability to extract local shape information from neighbors. Inspired by depthwise convolution, we propose a depthwise graph convolution which requires less memory consumption compared with the previous graph convolution. While depthwise graph convolution aggregates features channel-wisely, pointwise convolution is used to learn features across different channels. A customized block called DGConv is specially designed for local feature extraction based on depthwise graph convolution and pointwise convolution. The DGConv block can extract features from points and transfer features to neighbors while being invariant to different point orders. HDGCN is constructed by a series of DGConv blocks using a hierarchical structure which can extract both local and global features of point clouds.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to answer the two questions: how are individuals with production or maintenancemanagement positions in industry classifying different PD factors? Which factors are being measured and registered as PDs in the companies monitoring systems? Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal approach using a repeated cross-sectional survey design was adopted. Empirical data were collected from 80 companies in 2001 using a paper-based questionnaire, and from 71 companies in 2014 using a web-based questionnaire. Findings - A diverging view of 21 proposed PD factors is found between respondents in manufacturing industry, and there is also a lack of correspondence with existing literature. In particular, planned events are not classified and registered to the same extent as downtime losses. Moreover, the respondents are often prone to classify factors as PDs compared to what is actually registered. This diverging view has been consistent for over a decade, and hinders companies to develop systematic and effective strategies for handling of PDs.

In order to extract the neighborhood geometric features, we propose to construct a neighborhood graph that reflects the relationship between the neighborhood points of each point and then use the Chebyshev polynomials as the neighborhood graph filters. Further, we put the feature matrix and Laplacian matrix of each neighborhood into the network and use the max pooling operation to get the features of each center. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PointNGCNN has achieved good performance in the recognition and segmentation tasks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076388626

Hence, cost reduction is only possible by automating modelling. However, automatically classifying millions of IOs is a very hard classification problem due to the very large number of classes and the strong similarities between them. This paper tackles this challenge by (1) discovering the most frequent IOs and (2) measuring the man-hours required for modelling them in a state of the art software, EdgeWise. This allows to measure (a) the Total Labor Hours (TLH) spent per object type and (b) the performance of EdgeWise. We discovered that pipes, electrical conduit and circular hollow sections require 80% of the TLH needed to build the plant model. We showed that EdgeWise achieves cylinder detection with 75% recall and 62% precision. This paper is the first to discover the most laborious to model IOs and the first to evaluate state-of-the-art industrial modelling software.

They do not have an explicit neighborhood structure and therefore several researchers often perform a voxelization step to obtain structured 3D neighborhood. This, however, comes with certain disadvantages, e.g., it makes the data unnecessarily voluminous, enforces additional computation effort and can potentially introduce quantization errors that may not only hinder in extracting implicit 3D shape information but also in capturing the essential data invariances for the required segmentation and recognition task. In this context, this paper addresses the highly challenging problem of semantic segmentation and 3D object recognition using raw unstructured 3D point cloud data. Specifically, the deep network architecture has been proposed which consists of a cascaded combination of 3D point-based residual networks for simultaneous semantic scene segmentation and object classification. It exploits the 3D point-based convolutions for representational learning from raw unstructured 3D point cloud data. The proposed architecture has a simple design, easier implementation, and the performance which is better than the existing state-of-the architectures particularly for semantic scene segmentation over three public datasets.

However, it is also a very labor intensive step, which counteracts the perceived value of the resulting model. The state-of-the-art method for automating cylinder detection can detect cylinders with 62% precision and 70% recall, while other shapes must then be segmented manually and shape segmentation is not achieved. This performance is promising, but it is far from drastically eliminating the manual labor cost. We argue that the use of class segmentation deep learning algorithms has the theoretical potential to perform better in terms of per point accuracy and less manual segmentation time needed. However, such algorithms could not be used so far due to the lack of a pre-trained dataset of laser scanned industrial shapes as well as the lack of appropriate geometric features in order to learn these shapes. In this paper, we tackle both problems in three steps. First, we parse the industrial point cloud through a novel class segmentation solution (CLOI-NET) that consists of an optimized PointNET++ based deep learning network and post-processing algorithms that enforce stronger contextual relationships per point. We then allow the user to choose the optimal manual annotation of a test facility by means of active learning to further improve the results. We achieve the first step by clustering points in meaningful spatial 3D windows based on their location. Then, we apply a class segmentation deep network, and output a probability distribution of all label categories per point and improve the predicted labels by enforcing post-processing rules. We finally optimize the results by finding the optimal amount of data to be used for training experiments. We validate our method on the largest richly annotated dataset of the most important to model industrial shapes (CLOI) and yield 82% average accuracy per point, 95.6% average AUC among all classes and estimated 70% labor hour savings in class segmentation. This proves that it is the first to automatically segment industrial point cloud shapes with no prior knowledge at commercially viable performance and is the foundation for efficient industrial shape modeling in cluttered point clouds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086984810

Despite the growing demand, generating semantic rich 3D CAD models, particularly when building and structural systems are exposed remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address these limitations, this paper presents an end-to-end procedure to produce semantic rich 3D CAD models from point cloud data at a user defined level of abstraction. The procedure starts by segmenting a point cloud while considering local context using a multi-scale region growing algorithm. A Markov-Random-Field optimization labels segments based on their semantic categories. This step reduces the over-segmentation produced during the segmentation stage by compositing similarly labeled segments into super segments. The interconnectivity among these super-segments are reasoned and b-splines and solid geometrical representations are fit to produce 3D NURBS surfaces and cylindrical elements, respectively. Experimental results on real-world point clouds show an average fit error of 6.33 E-01 mm making the method the first to include beams and columns in an automated Scan2BIM process. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021698800

Hence, cost reduction is only possible by automating modelling. Our previous work has successfully identified the most frequent industrial objects which are in descending order: electrical conduit, straight pipes, circular hollow sections, elbows, channels, solid bars, I-beams, angles, flanges and valves. We modelled those on a state-of-the-art software, EdgeWise and then evaluated the performance of this software for pipeline and structural modelling. The modelling of pipelines is summarized in three basic steps: (a) automated extraction of cylinders, (b) their semantic classification and (c) manual extraction and editing of pipes. The results showed that cylinders are modelled with 75% recall and 62% precision on average. We discovered that pipes, electrical conduit and circular hollow sections require 80% of the Total Modelling Hours (TMH) of the 10 most frequent IOs to build the plant model. TMH was then compared to modelling hours in Revit and showed that 67% of pipe modelling time is saved by EdgeWise. This paper is the first to evaluate state-of-the-art industrial modelling software.
