A basic question is: Do we actually have adequate models of accident causation in the present dynamic society? The socio-technical system involved in risk management includes several levels ranging from legislators, over managers and work planners, to system operators this system is presently stressed by a fast pace of technological change, by an increasingly aggressive, competitive environment, and by changing regulatory practices and public pressure. Traditionally, each level of this is studied separately by a particular academic discipline, and modelling is done by generalising across systems and their particular hazard sources. It is argued that risk management must be modelled by cross- disciplinary studies, considering risk management to be a control problem and serving to represent the control structure involving all levels of society for each particular hazard category. Furthermore, it is argued that this requires a system-oriented approach based on functional abstraction rather than structural decomposition. Therefore task analysis focused on action sequences and occasional deviation in terms of human errors should be replaced by a model of behaviour shaping mechanisms in terms of work system constraints, boundaries of acceptable performance, and subjective criteria guiding adaptation to change. It is found that at present a convergence of research paradigms of human sciences guided by cognitive science concepts supports this approach. A review of this convergence within decision theory and management research is presented in comparison with the evolution of paradigms within safety research.In spite of all efforts to design safer systems, we still witness severe, large-scale accidents.

A rule-based engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents before construction starts.

Recently there had been an emergence of a variety of construction safety research focusing on topics such as safety competency, accident statistics, design for safety, and safety culture. A large number of construction safety studies with the variety of topics make it difficult for stakeholders to have an overview of this field. Hence a systematic review of previous studies is paramount for facilitating sharing useful research findings and accessing future trends in construction safety research. A five-step framework was proposed in this review. The analysis focused on publication year, journal title, country/region distribution, organizational level, project phase, project type, innovative technology application and research topic. Three groups of construction safety research were identified. The first group of research is conducted from the perspective of safety management process, such as safety assessment and safety program. The second group aims to explore the impact of individual and group characteristics in relation to construction safety, such as worker behavior, perception, and safety climate. The third group utilizes accident/incident data to improve safety performance. In order to better capture construction safety research trend, these studies were discussed from chronological and thematic perspectives. Four main research findings including construction safety research perspectives, construction safety research trends, innovative technology applications in construction safety, and safety information flow, were gained. Finally, this review identified and discussed research gaps and corresponding agenda which can serve as guidance for future construction safety research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909954125

BIM-based modeling and 4D simulation (3D and schedule) has brought many benefits to safety and logistics applications as well. However, only limited automation in modeling and planning safety processes has been exploited so far. The objective of this study is to investigate how potential fall hazards that are unknowingly built into the construction schedule can be identified and eliminated early in the planning phase of a construction project. A survey of research on construction safety and BIM is presented first. Then, a framework was developed that includes automated safety rule-checking algorithms for BIM. The developed prototype was tested using models including an office and a residential building project in Finland. The first case study highlights the comparison of manual vs. automated safety modeling of fall protective systems. It also describes the details to multiple design and as-built scenarios where protective safety equipment is modeled. The second case study presents results of applying the framework to the project schedule. It specifically simulates fall hazard detection and prevention. The contribution of this work is an automated rule-checking framework that integrates safety into BIM effectively and provides practitioners with a method for detecting and preventing fall-related hazards.

However, a comprehensive critical review of the visualization technology in construction safety management is absent in the literature. This paper provides a comprehensive review to investigate research and development, application methods, achievements and barriers to the use of visualization technology in safety management, and suggests possible future research directions to extend its application. It is found that visualization technology can improve safety management by aiding safety training, job hazard area (JHA) identification and on-site safety monitoring and warnings, but there are barriers or limitations involved. Existing location technologies, for instance, can perform well only in relatively small areas due to their generally poor penetrating performance.

Falls remain a major concern as they contribute to very serious injuries or even fatalities on construction projects around the world. Since the standards and rules for protective safety equipment vary by country, the growing numbers of internationally operating companies are in need of tools that allow ubiquitous understanding and planning of safety regardless of the country where they operate. The problem is examined using a customizable automatic safety rule-checking platform for building information models. The applied rule-based checking algorithms are designed to be add-ons to existing building information modelling (BIM) software and can check models for safety hazards early in the design and planning process. Once hazards have been identified preventative safety equipment can be designed, estimated, and included in the construction schedule before construction starts. A case study implements the safety rule-checking platform on a high-rise building project. Fall protection regulations from both the USA and Germany are applied to the developed rule-checking platform. Visualization of the safety information further explains the differences in the results once country-specific safety-regulative standards are applied on the same building information model.

Therefore, there is a compelling need for tools that can put the safety-in-design concept into practice. To improve the current situation, a prevention through design (PTD) tool based on computer software was developed. Construction safety best practices were compiled into computable rules so that the PTD tool can automatically conduct compliance checking. Particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents since falls are the most frequently occurring cause of fatalities on construction sites. This tool efficiently makes PTD suggestions available to designers and constructors. With this PTD tool, it is possible for project participants to work together to optimize building designs for construction worker safety, which provides valuable downstream benefits. By using the results of the safety check by this PTD tool, constructors have the opportunity to plan for preliminary safety measures to address construction site hazards from the beginning of the project.
